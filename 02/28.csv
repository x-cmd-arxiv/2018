recently discovered by the IceCube experiment. Neutrinos are always produced
together with gamma-rays, but the gamma-ray flux from extragalactic sources is
suppressed due to attenuation in the intergalactic medium. We report the
discovery of a gamma-ray excess at high Galactic latitudes starting at energies
300 GeV in the data of the Fermi telescope. We show that the multi-TeV
gamma-ray diffuse emission has spectral characteristics at both low and high
Galactic latitudes compatible with those of the IceCube high neutrino signal in
the same sky regions. This suggests that these gamma-rays are the counterpart
of the IceCube neutrino signal, implying that a sizable part of the IceCube
neutrino flux originates from the Milky Way. We argue that the diffuse neutrino
and gamma-ray signal at high Galactic latitudes originates either from
previously unknown nearby cosmic ray ""PeVatron"" source(s), an extended Galactic
CR halo or from decays of heavy dark matter particles.

daily-life images with attractive artistic styles. Previous work has succeeded
in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to style transfer for
monocular images or videos. However, style transfer for stereoscopic images is
still a missing piece. Different from processing a monocular image, the two
views of a stylized stereoscopic pair are required to be consistent to provide
observers a comfortable visual experience. In this paper, we propose a novel
dual path network for view-consistent style transfer on stereoscopic images.
While each view of the stereoscopic pair is processed in an individual path, a
novel feature aggregation strategy is proposed to effectively share information
between the two paths. Besides a traditional perceptual loss being used for
controlling the style transfer quality in each view, a multi-layer view loss is
leveraged to enforce the network to coordinate the learning of both the paths
to generate view-consistent stylized results. Extensive experiments show that,
compared against previous methods, our proposed model can produce stylized
stereoscopic images which achieve decent view consistency.

attempt to accurately detect the presence of target individuals over a

target individuals are designed a priori during enrollment using a limited
number of reference still images or video data. These facial models are not
typically representative of faces being observed during operations due to large
variations in illumination, pose, scale, occlusion, blur, and to camera

high-quality reference still image captured with still camera under controlled
conditions is employed to generate a facial model to be matched later against
lower-quality faces captured with video cameras under uncontrolled conditions.
Current video-based FR systems can perform well on controlled scenarios, while
their performance is not satisfactory in uncontrolled scenarios mainly because
of the differences between the source (enrollment) and the target (operational)
domains. Most of the efforts in this area have been toward the design of robust
video-based FR systems in unconstrained surveillance environments. This chapter

interactions can have a significant impact on these quantities, the inclusion
of core excitations in the model is essential for useful calculation to be
performed. The effect of core excitations must be included in order to gain a
detailed understanding of both the ground state and spin-isospin properties of
these systems. To this end, we include the vibrational excitation of the core
nucleus in our model. We solve the three-body core-nucleon-nucleon problem
including core vibrational states to obtain the nuclear ground state as well as
spin-isospin excitations. The spin-isospin excitations are examined from the
point of view of SU(4) multiplets. By including the effect of core excitation,
several experimental quantities of $N=Z$ odd-odd nuclei are better described,
and the root mean square distances between proton and neutron and that between
the center of mass of proton and neutron and core nucleus increase. Large
$B$($M1$) and $B$(GT) observed for $^{18}$F and $^{40}$Ca were explained in
terms of the SU(4) symmetry. The core nucleus is meaningfully broken by the
residual core-nucleon interactions, and various quantities concerning
spin-isospin excitations as well as the ground state become consistent with
experimental data. Including the core excitation in the three-body model is
thus important for a more detailed understanding of nuclear structure.

A quantum seal is a state
provided by Alice to Bob along with information which Bob can use to make a
measurement, ""break the seal,"" and read the classical message stored inside.
There are two success criteria for a seal: the probability Bob can successfully
read the message without any further information from Alice must be high, and
if Alice asks for the state back from Bob, the probability Alice can tell if
Bob broke the seal without permission must be high. We build on the work of
[Chau, PRA 2007], which gave optimal bounds on these criteria, showing that
they are mutually exclusive for high probability. We weaken the assumptions of
this previous work by providing Bob with only a classical description of a
prescribed measurement, rather than classical descriptions of the possible seal

to its interaction with the bath of nuclear spins in the surrounding isotopes.
This effect can be reduced by subjecting the system to an external magnetic
field and by applying optical pulses. By repeated pulses in long trains the
spin precession can be synchronized to the pulse period $T_\text{R}$. This
drives the nuclear spin bath into states far from equilibrium leading to
nuclear frequency focusing. In this paper, we use an efficient classical
approach introduced in Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{96}$, 054415 (2017) to describe

WSe2(1-x)Te2x in both the in-plane direction (parallel to the basal planes) and
the cross-plane direction (along the c-axis) using time-domain
thermoreflectance measurements. In the WSe2(1-x)Te2x alloys, the cross-plane
thermal conductivity is observed to be dependent on the heating frequency
(modulation frequency of the pump laser) due to the non-equilibrium transport
between different phonon modes. Using a two-channel heat conduction model, we
extracted the anisotropic thermal conductivity at the equilibrium limit. A
clear discontinuity in both the cross-plane and the in-plane thermal
conductivity is observed as x increases from 0.4 to 0.6 due to the phase
transition from the 2H to Td phase in the layered 2D alloys. The temperature
dependence of thermal conductivity for the TMD alloys was found to become
weaker compared with the pristine 2H WSe2 and Td WTe2 due to the atomic
disorder. This work serves as an important starting point for exploring phonon

different analysis methods, both parametric and non parametric (Independent

  publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to densification of wireless networks, there exist abundance of idling
computation resources at edge devices. These resources can be scavenged by
offloading heavy computation tasks from small IoT devices in proximity, thereby
overcoming their limitations and lengthening their battery lives. However,
unlike dedicated servers, the spare resources offered by edge helpers are
random and intermittent. Thus, it is essential for a user to intelligently
control the amounts of data for offloading and local computing so as to ensure
a computation task can be finished in time consuming minimum energy. In this
paper, we design energy-efficient control policies in a computation offloading
system with a random channel and a helper with a dynamically loaded CPU.
Specifically, the policy adopted by the helper aims at determining the sizes of
offloaded and locally-computed data for a given task in different slots such
that the total energy consumption for transmission and local CPU is minimized
under a task-deadline constraint. As the result, the polices endow an
offloading user robustness against channel-and-helper randomness besides
balancing offloading and local computing. By modeling the channel and
helper-CPU as Markov chains, the problem of offloading control is converted
into a Markov-decision process. Though dynamic programming (DP) for numerically
solving the problem does not yield the optimal policies in closed form, we
leverage the procedure to quantify the optimal policy structure and apply the
result to design optimal or sub-optimal policies. For different cases ranging
from zero to large buffers, the low-complexity of the policies overcomes the
""curse-of-dimensionality"" in DP arising from joint consideration of channel,
helper CPU and buffer states.

that there can be both negative mobility where the velocity decreases with
increasing driving force as well as a reentrant pinning effect in which the
particles flow at low drives but become pinned at intermediate drives. This
reentrant pinning is associated with a transition from smooth one-dimensional
flow at low drives to a clogged state at higher drives that occurs when the
particles cluster in a small number of plaquettes and block the flow. When the
drive is further increased, particle rearrangements occur that cause the clog
to break apart. We map out the regimes in which the pinned, flowing, and

monitoring to maintain lung function over time and minimize onset of acute
respiratory events known as pulmonary exacerbations. From the clinical point of
view it is important to characterize the association between key biomarkers
such as $FEV_1$ and time-to first exacerbation. Progression of the disease is
heterogeneous, yielding different sub-groups in the population exhibiting
distinct longitudinal profiles. It is desirable to categorize these unobserved
sub-groups (latent classes) according to their distinctive trajectories.
Accounting for these latent classes, in other words heterogeneity, will lead to
improved estimates of association arising from the joint longitudinal-survival
model.
  The joint model of longitudinal and survival data constitutes a popular
framework to analyze such data arising from heterogeneous cohorts. In
particular, two paradigms within this framework are the shared parameter joint
models and the joint latent class models. The former paradigm allows one to
quantify the strength of the association between the longitudinal and survival
outcomes but does not allow for latent sub-populations. The latter paradigm
explicitly postulates the existence of sub-populations but does not directly
quantify the strength of the association.
  We propose to integrate latent classes in the shared parameter joint model in
a fully Bayesian approach, which allows us to investigate the association
between $FEV_1$ and time-to first exacerbation within each latent class. We,
furthermore, focus on the selection of the optimal number of latent classes.

For two-dimensional (2D) systems, this is also because the experimental and

massive NS (MNS) with an associated kilonova; 3) GRB 060614 the prototype of a

with the exceptional observations in the optical, infrared, X- and gamma-rays

quasiparticle which is subject to confinement. This 'spin-polaron' possesses
internal degrees of freedom with a characteristic 'ladder' excitation spectrum.
Despite its fundamental importance for understanding high-temperature
superconductivity, clear experimental spectroscopic signatures of these
internal degrees of freedom are scarce. Here we present scanning tunneling
spectroscopy results of the spin-orbit-induced Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_{4}$.
Our spectroscopy data reveal distinct shoulder-like features for occupied and
unoccupied states beyond a measured Mott gap of $\Delta\approx620$~meV. Using
the self-consistent Born approximation we assign the anomalies in the
unoccupied states to the spin-polaronic ladder spectrum with excellent
quantitative agreement and estimate the Coulomb repulsion $U$ = 2.05 ...2.28 eV
in this material. These results confirm the strongly correlated electronic
structure of this compound and underpin the previously conjectured paradigm of
emergent unconventional superconductivity in doped Sr$_2$IrO$_{4}$.

cross fold training on a single set of ground truth data (line images and their

of maximal disagreement we select additional training lines which the voters
disagree most on, expecting them to offer the highest information gain for a
subsequent training (active learning). Evaluations on six early printed books

bulk field favoring the liquid, nucleation and growth of the liquid phase
starting from the region of the chemical inhomogeneity is analyzed. Three
regimes occur: for small fields, the critical droplet radius is so large that a
critical droplet having the contact angle required by Young's equation in the
region of the chemical inhomogeneity does not yet fit there, since the baseline
length of the circle-cut sphere droplet would exceed b. For an intermedium
regime of bulk fields, such droplets fit inside the inhomogeneity, and are
indeed found in simulations with large enough observation times, but these
droplets remain pinned to the chemical inhomogeneity when their baseline has
grown to the length b. On general grounds one can predict that the effective
contact angle as well as the excess density of the droplets, scaled by b^2, are
functions of the product b and the bulk field, but do not depend on both
variables separately. For larger fields the droplets nucleated at the chemical
inhomogeneity grow to the full system size.

latter by state-dependent hierarchy of relaxation times to assess their
relevance for irreversible contributions. Given an observation time
{\tau}_{obs}, we determine the window of relaxation times that divide the
internal variables into active and inactive groups, the former playing a
central role in the NEQ thermodynamics. Using this thermodynamics, we determine
(i) a bound on the NEQ entropy and on the residual entropy, and (ii) the nature
of isothermal relaxation of the entropy and the enthalpy in accordance with the
second law. A theory that violates the second law such as the entropy loss view
is shown to be internally inconsistent if we require it to be consistent with

determining the temperature T(t), the pressure P(t), of the system, which

nonclassical area projected by the optical tomogram of a quantum state is
greater than zero, the state is nonclassical, and the area is zero for the pure
classical state. It is also noted that the nonclassical area of a quantum state
increases with an increase in the strength of nonclassicality inducing
operations on the state such as squeezing, photon addition, etc. We have tested
the validity of the nonclassical area measure by calculating the same for
certain well-known nonclassical states and found that essential features of the
nonclassicality shown by the states are captured in the nonclassical area. We
have also shown that the nonclassical area is robust against
environment-induced decoherence of the states. Nonclassical area projected by
the optical tomogram of a quantum state of light is experimentally tractable
using the balanced homodyne detection of the quadrature operator of the field,
avoiding the reconstruction of the density matrix or the quasiprobability

we address methods which allow one to capture the full entanglement without
truncation of the Hilbert space. Such methods are suitable for validation of
and comparisons to tensor network algorithms, but especially useful in the case
of new kinds of quantum states with high entanglement violating the truncation
in tensor networks. Quantum cellular automata are one example for such a
system, characterized by tunable complexity, entanglement, and a large spread
over the Hilbert space. Beyond the evolution of pure states as a closed system,
we adapt the techniques for open quantum systems simulated via the Lindblad
master equation. We present three algorithms for solving closed-system
many-body time evolution without truncation of the Hilbert space. Exact
diagonalization methods have the advantage that they not only keep the full
entanglement but also require no approximations to the propagator. Seeking the
limits of a maximal number of qubits on a single core, we use Trotter
decompositions or Krylov approximation to the exponential of the Hamiltonian.
All three methods are also implemented for open systems represented via the
Lindblad master equation built from local channels. We show their convergence
parameters and focus on efficient schemes for their implementations including
Abelian symmetries, e.g., U(1) symmetry used for number conservation in the
Bose-Hubbard model or discrete Z2 symmetries in the quantum Ising model. We
present the thermalization timescale in the long-range quantum Ising model as a

uniqueness results for linear and non-linear wave equations without assuming

non-zero surface gravity necessarily admits a Killing vector field. This work
is therefore related to the strong cosmic censorship conjecture.

Fe3O2BO3. One of them associates the physical behavior to charge ordering
processes among the cations, as is well known in simpler oxides. The other
attributes the effects to local pairwise magnetic interactions. Recently first
principles calculations in the iron ludwigite have shown that the structural
cation dimerization is due to the formation of strong magnetic dyads supporting
the second model. Here we confirm the dominance of magnetic interactions to
explain the absence of dimerization in the cobalt compound. Density functional
non-collinear spin calculations are carried out on Co3O2BO3 to determine its
low temperature magnetic order. Low spin is found on tri-valent cobalt sites,
thus preventing the formation of the ferromagnetic dyad, the mechanism which
favors dimerization in Fe3O2BO3. We conclude that the difference between high
spin Fe3+ and low spin Co3+ pairwise interactions is responsible for the
observed differences between the two compounds. The pairwise magnetic
interactions also explain the difference between the existence of low
temperature bulk AF state in the Fe ludwigite and its absence in the Co

convergence rate for different approximate representations of $\alpha$-stable
distributions. Although they play a key role in modelling random processes with
jumps and discontinuities, the use of $\alpha$-stable distributions in
inference often leads to analytically intractable problems. The LePage series,
which is a probabilistic representation employed in this work, is used to
transform an intractable, infinite-dimensional inference problem into a
conditionally Gaussian parametric problem. A major component of our approach is
the approximation of the tail of this series by a Gaussian random variable.
Standard statistical techniques, such as Expectation-Maximization, Markov chain
Monte Carlo, and Particle Filtering, can then be applied. In addition to the
asymptotic normality of the tail of this series, we establish explicit,
nonasymptotic bounds on the approximation error. Their proofs follow classical
Fourier-analytic arguments, using Ess\'{e}en's smoothing lemma. Specifically,
we consider the distance between the distributions of: $(i)$~the tail of the
series and an appropriate Gaussian; $(ii)$~the full series and the truncated
series; and $(iii)$~the full series and the truncated series with an added
Gaussian term. In all three cases, sharp bounds are established, and the
theoretical results are compared with the actual distances (computed
numerically) in specific examples of symmetric $\alpha$-stable distributions.
This analysis facilitates the selection of appropriate truncations in practice
and offers theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of resulting estimates. One
of the main conclusions obtained is that, for the purposes of inference, the
use of a truncated series together with an approximately Gaussian error term
has superior statistical properties and is likely a preferable choice in
practice.

  STEM-EELS imaging",,,,,"eess.IV cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.CV physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electron microscopy has shown to be a very powerful tool to map the chemical
nature of samples at various scales down to atomic resolution. However, many
samples can not be analyzed with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio because of
the radiation damage induced by the electron beam. This is particularly crucial
for electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) which acquires spectral-spatial
data and requires high beam intensity. Since scanning transmission electron
microscopes (STEM) are able to acquire data cubes by scanning the electron
probe over the sample and recording a spectrum for each spatial position, it is
possible to design the scan pattern and to sample only specific pixels. As a
consequence, partial acquisition schemes are now conceivable, provided a
reconstruction of the full data cube is conducted as a post-processing step.
This paper proposes two reconstruction algorithms for multi-band images
acquired by STEM-EELS which exploits the spectral structure and the spatial
smoothness of the image. The performance of the proposed schemes is illustrated
thanks to experiments conducted on a realistic phantom dataset as well as real
EELS spectrum-images.

are the pairs $\{g_i,g_j\}$ with $d(g_i,g_j)\leq L$, $d$ being the distance

describe the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of
$\Gamma(N,L)$, when $N$ goes to infinity. If $L$ is fixed and $N \to + \infty$
(Gaussian regime), then the largest eigenvalues of $\Gamma(N,L)$ converge after
an appropriate renormalisation towards certain explicit linear combinations of
values of Bessel functions. If $L = O(N^{-\frac{1}{\dim G}})$ and $N \to
+\infty$ (Poissonian regime), then the random geometric graph $\Gamma(N,L)$
converges in the local Benjamini-Schramm sense, which implies the weak
convergence in probability of the spectral measure of $\Gamma(N,L)$. In both
situations, the representation theory of the group $G$ provides us with
informations on the limit of the spectrum, and conversely, the computation of
this limiting spectrum involves many classical tools from representation
theory: Weyl's character formula and the weight lattice in the Gaussian regime,
and a degeneration of these objects in the Poissonian regime. The
representation theoretic approach allows one to understand precisely how the
degeneration from the Gaussian to the Poissonian regime occurs, and the article
is written so as to highlight this degeneration phenomenon. In the Poissonian
regime, this approach leads us to an algebraic conjecture on certain
functionals of the irreducible representations of $G$.

Effective second-order upconversion (ESUP) of a seed to an idler can be

is within reach of current technology. Moreover, we show a nonlinear coupling
rate of seed and idler larger than the energy dissipation rate in the

devices for generating continuous wave (CW) electron beams with record high

high quantum efficiency (QE) photocathodes, while SRF technology provides for
high accelerating gradients exceeding 10 MV/m. It is especially true for low
frequency SRF guns where electrons are generated at photocathodes at the crest
of accelerating voltage. Two main physics challenges of SRF guns are their
compatibility with high QE photocathodes and multipacting. The first is related
to a possibility of deposition of photocathode materials (such as Cs) on the
walls of the SRF cavity, which can result in increased dark current via
reduction of the bulk Nb work function and in enhancing of a secondary electron
emission yield (SEY). SEY plays critical role in multipacting, which could both
spoil the gun vacuum and speed up the deposition of the cathode material on the
walls of the SRF cavity. In short, the multipactor behavior in superconducting
accelerating units must be well understood for successful operation of an SRF
photo-injector. In this paper we present our studies of 1.2 MV 113 MHz

operating our SRF gun we encountered a number of multipacting zones. We also
observed that presence of $\textrm{CsK}_{2}\textrm{Sb}$ photocathode in the gun
could create additional multipacting barriers. We had conducted a comprehensive
numerical and experimental study of the multipactor discharge in our SRF gun,
and had developed a process of crossing the multipacting barriers from zero to
the operational voltage without affecting the lifetime of our photocathode and

variability and predictability of planar friction. In particular, we focus on
the analysis of a recent dataset on planar pushing by Yu et al. [1] devised to
create a data-driven footprint of planar friction.
  We show in this paper how we can explain a significant fraction of the
observed unconventional phenomena, e.g., stochasticity and multi-modality, by
combining the effects of material non-homogeneity, anisotropy of friction and
biases due to data collection dynamics, hinting that the variability is
explainable but inevitable in practice.
  We introduce an anisotropic friction model and conduct simulation experiments
comparing with more standard isotropic friction models. The anisotropic
friction between object and supporting surface results in convergence of
initial condition during the automated data collection. Numerical results
confirm that the anisotropic friction model explains the bias in the dataset
and the apparent stochasticity in the outcome of a push. The fact that the data
collection process itself can originate biases in the collected datasets,
resulting in deterioration of trained models, calls attention to the data
collection dynamics.

However, upcoming 21-cm measurements during cosmic dawn, the period of the
first stellar formation, can provide new clues on the nature of dark matter.
During this era, the baryon-dark matter fluid is the slowest it will ever be,
making it ideal to search for dark matter elastically scattering with baryons
through massless mediators, such as the photon. Here we explore whether
dark-matter particles with an electric ""minicharge"" can significantly alter the
baryonic temperature and, thus, affect 21-cm observations. We find that the
entirety of the dark matter cannot be minicharged at a significant level, lest
it interferes with Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields. However, if
minicharged particles comprise a subpercent fraction of the dark matter, and
have charges $\epsilon \sim 10^{-6}$---in units of the electron charge---and
masses $m_\chi \sim 1-60$ MeV, they can significantly cool down the baryonic
fluid, and be discovered in 21-cm experiments. We show how this scenario can
explain the recent result by the EDGES collaboration, which requires a lower
baryonic temperature than possible within the standard model, while remaining
consistent with all current observations.

topologically invariant quantity such as the Chern number and the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ index. This quantity distinguishes a nontrivial topological
system from a trivial one. A topological phase transition may occur when there
are two topologically distinct phases, and it is usually defined by a gap
closing point where the topologically invariant quantity is ill-defined. In
this paper, we show that the magnon bands in the strained (distorted)
kagome-lattice ferromagnets realize an example of a topological magnon phase
transition in the realistic parameter regime of the system. When spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) is neglected (i.e. no Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), we
show that all three magnon branches are dispersive with no flat band, and there
exists a critical point where tilted Dirac and semi-Dirac point coexist in the
magnon spectra. The critical point separates two gapless magnon phases as
opposed to the usual phase transition. Upon the inclusion of SOC, we realize a
topological magnon phase transition point at the critical strain
$\delta_c=\frac{1}{2}\big[ 1-(D/J)^2\big]$, where $D$ and $J$ denote the
perturbative SOC and the Heisenberg spin exchange interaction respectively. It
separates two distinct topological magnon phases with different Chern numbers
for $\delta<\delta_c$ and for $\delta>\delta_c$. The associated anomalous
thermal Hall conductivity develops an abrupt change at $\delta_c$, due to the
divergence of the Berry curvature in momentum space. The proposed topological
magnon phase transition is experimentally feasible by applying external
perturbations such as uniaxial strain or pressure.

suppresses galaxy formation -- are imprinted in the luminosity function of
dwarf galaxies. We focus on the luminosity function of satellites of galaxies

function of the dwarf population as a whole. Our results show that the details
of these two characteristic properties of reionisation determine the shape of
the luminosity distribution of satellites in a unique way, and is largely
independent of the other details of the galaxy formation model. Our models
generically predict a bimodality in the distribution of satellites as a
function of luminosity: a population of faint satellites and population of
bright satellites separated by a 'valley' forged by reionisation. We show that
this bimodal distribution is present at high statistical significance in the
combined satellite luminosity function of the Milky Way and M31. We make
predictions for the expected number of satellites around LMC-mass dwarfs where
the bimodality may also be measurable in future observational programmes. Our
preferred model predicts a total of $26 \pm 10$ (68 per cent confidence)

proposed by Polychronakos as a regularization of the noncommutative
Chern-Simons theory description of the Laughlin states proposed earlier by
Susskind. Both models can be understood as describing the electrons in a FQH

geometric response in the FQH effect, with the goal of determining whether the
CSMM captures this aspect of the physics of the Laughlin states. For this model
we compute the Hall viscosity, Hall conductance in a non-uniform electric

geometry). Our calculations show that the CSMM captures the guiding center
contribution to the known values of these quantities in the Laughlin states,
but lacks the Landau orbit contribution. The interesting correlations in a
Laughlin state are contained entirely in the guiding center part of the

to simulations of proposed CMB space missions (PIXIE, LiteBIRD, CORE, PICO).
Our sky simulations include Galactic dust, Galactic synchrotron, Galactic

and $\mu$-distortion anisotropies, the latter being added as correlated field.
The Constrained ILC method allows us to null the CMB temperature anisotropies
in the reconstructed $\mu$-map (and vice versa), in addition to mitigating the
contaminations from astrophysical foregrounds and instrumental noise. We
compute the cross-power spectrum between the reconstructed (CMB-free)
$\mu$-distortion map and the ($\mu$-free) CMB temperature map, after foreground
removal and component separation. Since the cross-power spectrum is
proportional to the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}$, on
scales $k\simeq 740$ Mpc$^{-1}$, this allows us to derive $f_{\rm
NL}$-detection limits for the aforementioned future CMB experiments. Our
analysis shows that foregrounds degrade the theoretical detection limits (based
mostly on instrumental noise) by more than one order of magnitude, with PICO
standing the best chance at placing upper limits on scale-dependent
non-Gaussianity. We also discuss the dependence of the constraints on the
channel sensitivities and chosen bands. Like for $B$-mode polarization
measurements, extended coverage at frequencies $\nu\lesssim 40\,{\rm GHz}$ and
$\nu\gtrsim 400\,{\rm GHz}$ provides more leverage than increased channel

($50^{+20}_{-15}$%) and span five orders of magnitude in UV luminosity
($M_{UV}\approx-19$ to -24). Many (70%) show at least one high ionisation
rest-frame UV line such as CIV, NV, CIII], HeII or OIII], typically
blue-shifted by ~100-200 km/s relative to Lya. Their Lya profiles reveal a wide

from 200 to 4000 km/s. Overall, 60+-11% appear to be AGN dominated, and at

large-scale environmental dependence of the satellite-central alignment in
groups with blue centrals. Satellites of blue centrals in knots are
preferentially located perpendicular to the major axis of the centrals, and the
alignment angle decreases with environment namely when going from knots to
voids. The alignment angle strongly depend on the ${}^{0.1}(g-r)$ colour of
centrals. We suggest that the satellite-central alignment is the result of a
competition between satellite accretion within large scale-structure and galaxy
evolution inside host haloes. For groups containing red central galaxies, the
satellite-central alignment is mainly determined by the evolution effect, while
for blue central dominated groups, the effect of large-scale structure plays a
more important role, especially in knots. Our results provide an explanation
for how the satellite-central alignment forms within different large-scale

estimates for hotspots A and D from synchrotron self-Compton models imply that

It has been noticed that in symmetric-tensor ${\rm U}(1)$ gauge theories,
charges are fractons and cannot move freely due to, for example, the
conservation of not only the charge but also the dipole moment. To connect
these theories with fully gapped fracton models, we study Higgs and partial

$\sim$36~min. The peak flux above 200 GeV is $(4.2 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-6}

contemporaneous with the TeV gamma-ray flare was observed in GeV gamma-ray,

Additionally, a possible moving emission feature with superluminal apparent

contribution from old populations, spanning various effective temperatures,
fuel consumptions and metallicities. We find that a subset of our indices, Mg
I, Fe I, and BL3096, are able to differentiate between old and young UV ages.
We find evidence for old stars contributing to the UV in massive galaxies,
rather than star formation. The data favour models with low/medium upturn
temperatures (10,000 - 25,000K) consistent with local galaxies, depending on
the assumed metallicity, and with a larger fuel (f ~ 0.065 Msun). Models with
one typical temperature are favoured over models with a temperature range,
which would be typical of an extended horizontal branch. Old UV-bright
populations are found in the whole galaxy sample (~92%), with a mass fraction
peaking around 20-30%. Upturn galaxies are massive and have redder colours, in
agreement with findings in the local Universe. We find that the upturn
phenomenon appears at z~1 and its frequency increases towards lower redshift,
as expected by stellar evolution of low mass stars. Our findings will help
constrain stellar evolution in the exotic UV upturn phase.

that further generalizations of the HOD model would open opportunities for the

provides the best results, in good agreement with those obtained from
cosmological surveys. Our main results from this model are: a) The time since
the onset of the star formation is larger in the inner regions than in the
outer ones, while tau is similar or smaller in the inner than in the outer
regions. b) The sSFR declines rapidly as the Universe evolves, and faster for
early than for late type galaxies, and for the inner than for the outer regions
of galaxies. c) SFRD and SMD agree well with results from cosmological surveys.
At z< 0.5, most star formation takes place in the outer regions of late spiral
galaxies, while at z>2 the inner regions of the progenitors of the current E
and S0 are the major contributors to SFRD. d) The inner regions of galaxies are
the major contributor to SMD at z> 0.5, growing their mass faster than the
outer regions, with a lookback time at 50% SMD of 9 and 6 Gyr for the inner and
outer regions. e) The MSSF follows a power-law at high redshift, with the slope
evolving with time, but always being sub-linear. f) In agreement with galaxy
surveys at different redshifts, the average SFH of CALIFA galaxies indicates
that galaxies grow their mass mainly in a mode that is well represented by a
delayed-tau model, with the peak at z~2 and an e-folding time of 3.9 Gyr.

quality indicators of several previous studies. Our results suggest that
PROMETHEUS is a very promising methodology, and that the metrics and indicators

understanding the physics of these materials. At low temperature, the
superconducting state gives way to a long-range charge order with increasing
magnetic field; both the orders coexist in a small intermediate region. The
charge order transition is strikingly insensitive to temperature, and quickly
reaches a transition temperature close to the zero-field superconducting $T_c$.
We argue that such a transition along with the presence of the coexisting phase
cannot be described simply by a competing orders formalism. We demonstrate that
for some range of parameters there is an enlarged symmetry of the strongly
coupled charge and superconducting orders in the system depending on their
relative masses and the coupling strength of the two orders. We establish that
this sharp switch from the superconducting phase to the charge order phase can
be understood in the framework of a composite SU(2) order parameter comprising
the charge and superconducting orders. Finally, we illustrate that there is a
possibility of the coexisting phase of the competing charge and superconducting
orders only when the SU(2) symmetry between them is weakly broken due to
biquadratic terms in the free energy. The relation of this sharp transition to
the proximity to the pseudogap quantum critical doping is also discussed.

together with 630 radial velocities (RVs) of the host star acquired over the
past two decades from McDonald Observatory, Keck Observatory, and the Automated
Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. The RVs reveal that Gl 758 is accelerating
with an evolving rate that varies between 2-5 m s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent
with the expected influence of the imaged companion Gl 758 B. A joint fit of
the RVs and astrometry yields a dynamical mass of 42$^{+19}_{-7}$
M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ for the companion with a robust lower limit of 30.5
M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ at the 4-$\sigma$ level. Gl 758 B is on an eccentric orbit
($e$ = 0.26-0.67 at 95% confidence) with a semimajor axis of $a$ =
$21.1_{-1.3}^{+2.7}$ AU and an orbital period of $P$ = $96_{-9}^{+21}$ yr,
which takes it within $\approx$9 AU from its host star at periastron passage.
Substellar evolutionary models generally underpredict the mass of Gl 758 B for
nominal ages of 1-6 Gyr that have previously been adopted for the host star.
This discrepancy can be reconciled if the system is older---which is consistent
with activity indicators and recent isochrone fitting of the host star---or
alternatively if the models are systematically overluminous by $\approx$0.1-0.2
dex. Gl 758 B is currently the lowest-mass directly imaged companion inducing a
measured acceleration on its host star. In the future, bridging RVs and
high-contrast imaging with the next generation of extremely large telescopes
and space-based facilities will open the door to the first dynamical mass

using the melting point transition in classical molecular dynamics simulations

dramatically reduce the dimensionality of the feature space across the samples
using an orthogonal linear transformation that preserves the statistical
variance of the data under the condition that the new feature space is linearly
independent. From there, k-means clustering is used to partition the samples
into solid and liquid phases through a criterion motivated by the geometry of
the reduced feature space of the samples, allowing for an estimation of the
melting point transition. This pattern criterion is conceptually similar to how
humans interpret the data but with far greater throughput, as the shapes of the
radial distributions are different for each phase and easily distinguishable by
humans. The transition temperature estimates derived from this machine learning

several challenges, including cooperative exploration, task selection and
allocation, time limitations, and computational complexity. To address this, we
propose a decentralized multi-agent decision-making framework for the search

allocated budget in a setting where each agent action incurs a time cost and
yields a certain reward. Our approach leverages probabilistic reasoning to make
near-optimal decisions leading to maximized reward. We evaluate our method in
the search, pick, and place scenario of the Mohamed Bin Zayed International
Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC), by using a probability density map and reward
prediction function to assess actions. Extensive simulations show that our
algorithm outperforms benchmark strategies, and we demonstrate system
integration in a Gazebo-based environment, validating the framework's readiness
for field application.

symmetry and monotonicity with respect to the source peak position. We also

the KELT survey to focus on discovering planets transiting relatively hot host

Over half of these planets transit rapidly-rotating stars with Teff > 6250 K,

of molecular collisions, molecule-surface interaction, chemical reactions, and

experiments in a downstream science chamber is limited by skimmer clogging,
which constrains the separation between a valve and a skimmer to at least
several hundred nozzle diameters. A recent experiment (Science Advances, 2017,
3, e1602258) has introduced a new strategy to address this challenge: when a
skimmer is cooled to a temperature below the freezing point of the carrier gas,
skimmer clogging can be effectively suppressed. We go beyond this
proof-of-principle work in several key ways. Firstly, we apply the skimmer
cooling approach to discharge-produced radical and metastable beams entrained
in a carrier gas. We also identify two different processes for skimmer clogging
mitigation-shockwave suppression at temperatures around the carrier gas
freezing point and diffusive clogging at even lower temperatures. With the
carrier clogging removed, we now fully optimize the production of entrained
species such as hydroxyl radicals, resulting in a gain of 30 in density over
the best commercial devices. The gain arises from both clogging mitigation and
favorable geometry with a much shorter valve-skimmer distance.

the use of a tunable pseudo-mass parameter that improves the discretization

communication systems. Part I of this paper focuses on FP theory and on solving
continuous problems. The main theoretical contribution is a novel quadratic
transform technique for tackling the multiple-ratio concave-convex FP
problem--in contrast to conventional FP techniques that mostly can only deal
with the single-ratio or the max-min-ratio case. Multiple-ratio FP problems are
important for the optimization of communication networks, because system-level
design often involves multiple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio terms.
This paper considers the applications of FP to solving continuous problems in
communication system design, particularly for power control, beamforming, and
energy efficiency maximization. These application cases illustrate that the
proposed quadratic transform can greatly facilitate the optimization involving
ratios by recasting the original nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex
problems. This FP-based problem reformulation gives rise to an efficient
iterative optimization algorithm with provable convergence to a stationary
point. The paper further demonstrates close connections between the proposed FP
approach and other well-known algorithms in the literature, such as the
fixed-point iteration and the weighted minimum mean-square-error beamforming.
The optimization of discrete problems is discussed in Part II of this paper.

has enabled novel tests of general relativity, including direct study of the
polarization of gravitational waves. While general relativity allows for only
two tensor gravitational-wave polarizations, general metric theories can
additionally predict two vector and two scalar polarizations. The polarization
of gravitational waves is encoded in the spectral shape of the stochastic
gravitational-wave background, formed by the superposition of cosmological and
individually-unresolved astrophysical sources. Using data recorded by Advanced
LIGO during its first observing run, we search for a stochastic background of
generically-polarized gravitational waves. We find no evidence for a background
of any polarization, and place the first direct bounds on the contributions of
vector and scalar polarizations to the stochastic background. Under log-uniform
priors for the energy in each polarization, we limit the energy-densities of
tensor, vector, and scalar modes at 95% credibility to $\Omega^T_0 < 5.6 \times
10^{-8}$, $\Omega^V_0 < 6.4\times 10^{-8}$, and $\Omega^S_0 < 1.1\times
10^{-7}$ at a reference frequency $f_0 = 25$ Hz.

however they are nearly unexplored in the terahertz (THz) domain. In this
letter, we report on THz WGMs in quartz glass bubble resonators with
sub-wavelength wall thickness. An unprecedented study of both the amplitude and
phase of THz WGMs is presented. The coherent THz frequency domain measurements
are in excellent agreement with a simple analytical model and results from
numerical simulations. A high finesse of 9 and a quality (Q) factor exceeding
440 at 0.47 THz are observed. Due to the large evanescent field the high
Q-factor THz WGM bubble resonators can be used as a compact, highly sensitive
sensor in the intriguing THz frequency range.

microlens parallax $\pie$, but precise $\pie$ measurement, in many cases, is
hampered due to the subtlety of the microlens-parallax signal combined with the
difficulty of distinguishing the signal from those induced by other
higher-order effects. In this work, we present the analysis of the binary-lens
event OGLE-2017-BLG-0329, for which $\pie$ is measured with a dramatically
improved precision using additional data from space-based $Spitzer$
observations. We find that while the parallax model based on the ground-based
data cannot be distinguished from a zero-$\pie$ model at 2$\sigma$ level, the
addition of the $Spitzer$ data enables us to identify 2 classes of solutions,
each composed of a pair of solutions according to the well-known ecliptic
degeneracy. It is found that the space-based data reduce the measurement
uncertainties of the north and east components of the microlens-parallax vector
$\pivec_{\rm E}$ by factors $\sim 18$ and $\sim 4$, respectively. With the
measured microlens parallax combined with the angular Einstein radius measured
from the resolved caustic crossings, we find that the lens is composed of a
binary with components masses of either $(M_1,M_2)\sim (1.1,0.8)\ M_\odot$ or
$\sim (0.4,0.3)\ M_\odot$ according to the two solution classes. The first
solution is significantly favored but the second cannot be securely ruled out
based on the microlensing data alone. However, the degeneracy can be resolved
from adaptive optics observations taken $\sim 10$ years after the event.

considerably more difficult to solve. Unlike the continuous problems, discrete
or mixed discrete-continuous problems normally cannot be recast as convex
problems. In contrast to the common heuristic of relaxing the discrete
variables, this work reformulates the original problem in an FP form amenable
to distributed combinatorial optimization. The paper illustrates this
methodology by tackling the important and challenging problem of uplink
coordinated multi-cell user scheduling in wireless cellular systems. Uplink
scheduling is more challenging than downlink scheduling, because uplink user
scheduling decisions significantly affect the interference pattern in nearby
cells. Further, the discrete scheduling variable needs to be optimized jointly
with continuous variables such as transmit power levels and beamformers. The
main idea of the proposed FP approach is to decouple the interaction among the
interfering links, thereby permitting a distributed and joint optimization of
the discrete and continuous variables with provable convergence. The paper
shows that the well-known weighted minimum mean-square-error (WMMSE) algorithm
can also be derived from a particular use of FP; but our proposed FP-based
method significantly outperforms WMMSE when discrete user scheduling variables
are involved, both in term of run-time efficiency and optimizing results.

weakening of the pairing, disorder plays an essential role.

networks. Communication and changes of the graph happen in synchronous rounds
and our algorithms always, i.e., in every round, satisfy non-trivial
guarantees, no matter how dynamic the network is.
  We define a (in our view) natural generalization of static graph problems to
the dynamic graph setting. Throughout the execution of an algorithm we consider
a sliding window over the last $T$, e.g., polylogarithmic, rounds. Then, in
some round, the feasibility of an output only depends on the topology of the
graphs in the current sliding window and we call a feasible output a
$T$-dynamic solution. The guarantees of a $T$-dynamic solution become stronger
the more stable the graph is during this sliding window and, in particular,
they coincide with the definition of the static graph problem if the graph is
static throughout the window. We further present an abstract framework that
allows to develop algorithms that output $T$-dynamic solutions in all rounds.
The resulting algorithms have another desirable property: If a constant
neighborhood around some part of the graph is stable during an interval
$[t_1,t_2]$, the algorithms compute a static solution for this part of the
graph throughout the interval $[t_1+T',t_2]$ for some (small) $T'>0$.
  We demonstrate our generic framework with two sample problems that abstract
basic operations in dynamic networks, namely $\textit{(degree+1)-vertex
coloring}$ and $\textit{maximal independent set (MIS)}$. To illustrate the
given guarantees consider the vertex coloring problem: The sliding window of
our (randomized) algorithm is of length $T=O(\log n)$ and any conflict between
two nodes caused by a newly inserted edge is resolved within that time. During
this conflict resolving both nodes always output colors that are not in
conflict with their respective 'old' neighbors.

In this regard, there has been a recent surge of interest in designing
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the problem of brain tumor type
classification. However, CNNs typically require large amount of training data
and can not properly handle input transformations. Capsule networks (referred
to as CapsNets) are brand new machine learning architectures proposed very
recently to overcome these shortcomings of CNNs, and posed to revolutionize
deep learning solutions. Of particular interest to this work is that Capsule
networks are robust to rotation and affine transformation, and require far less
training data, which is the case for processing medical image datasets
including brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. In this paper, we
focus to achieve the following four objectives: (i) Adopt and incorporate
CapsNets for the problem of brain tumor classification to design an improved
architecture which maximizes the accuracy of the classification problem at
hand; (ii) Investigate the over-fitting problem of CapsNets based on a real set
of MRI images; (iii) Explore whether or not CapsNets are capable of providing
better fit for the whole brain images or just the segmented tumor, and; (iv)
Develop a visualization paradigm for the output of the CapsNet to better
explain the learned features. Our results show that the proposed approach can
successfully overcome CNNs for the brain tumor classification problem.

McGaugh et al have recently shown for 153 disc galaxies that observed radial
acceleration is an apparently universal function of classical acceleration
computed for observed galactic baryonic mass density. This is consistent with
the empirical MOND model, not requiring dark matter. It is shown here that
suitably constrained LCDM and conformal gravity (CG) also produce such a
universal correlation function. LCDM requires a very specific dark matter
distribution, while the implied CG nonclassical acceleration must be
independent of galactic mass. All three constrained radial acceleration
functions agree with the empirical baryonic $v^4$ Tully-Fisher relation.
Accurate rotation data in the nominally flat velocity range could distinguish

interstellar medium. The discovery have raised questions about routes of
formation of these anions in space. Some of the proposed mechanisms assumed
that anionic excited electronic states, either metastable or weakly bound, play
a key role in the formation process. Verification of this hypothesis requires
detailed knowledge of the electronic states of the anions. Here we investigate
bound and continuum states of four cyanopolyyne anions, CN$^-$, C$_3$N$^-$,
C$_5$N$^-$, and C$_7$N$^-$, by means of ab initio calculations. We employ the
equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method augmented with complex absorbing
potential. We predict that already in CN$^-$, the smallest anion in the family,
there are several low-lying metastable states of both singlet and triplet spin
symmetry. These states, identified as shape resonances, are located between
6.3-8.5 eV above the ground state of the anion (or 2.3-4.5 eV above the ground
state of the parent radical) and have widths of a few tenths of eV up to 1 eV.
We analyze the identified resonances in terms of leading molecular orbital
contributions and Dyson orbitals. As the carbon chain length increases in the
C$_{2n+1}$N$^-$ series, these resonances gradually become stabilized and
eventually turn into stable valence bound states. The trends in energies of the
transitions leading to both resonance and bound excited states can be
rationalized by means of the H\""{u}ckel model. Apart from valence excited
states, some of the cyanopolyynes can also support dipole bound states and

ablation studies to quantify the importance of various priors on human
performance. We do this by modifying the video game environment to
systematically mask different types of visual information that could be used by
humans as priors. We find that removal of some prior knowledge causes a drastic
degradation in the speed with which human players solve the game, e.g. from 2
minutes to over 20 minutes. Furthermore, our results indicate that general

However, current models struggle to explain the Moon's composition and isotopic
similarity with Earth. Here we present a new lunar origin model. High-energy,
high-angular momentum giant impacts can create a post-impact structure that
exceeds the corotation limit (CoRoL), which defines the hottest thermal state
and angular momentum possible for a corotating body. In a typical super-CoRoL
body, traditional definitions of mantle, atmosphere and disk are not
appropriate, and the body forms a new type of planetary structure, named a
synestia. Using simulations of cooling synestias combined with dynamic,
thermodynamic and geochemical calculations, we show that satellite formation
from a synestia can produce the main features of our Moon. We find that cooling
drives mixing of the structure, and condensation generates moonlets that orbit
within the synestia, surrounded by tens of bars of bulk silicate Earth (BSE)
vapor. The moonlets and growing moon are heated by the vapor until the first
major element (Si) begins to vaporize and buffer the temperature. Moonlets
equilibrate with BSE vapor at the temperature of silicate vaporization and the
pressure of the structure, establishing the lunar isotopic composition and
pattern of moderately volatile elements. Eventually, the cooling synestia
recedes within the lunar orbit, terminating the main stage of lunar accretion.
Our model shifts the paradigm for lunar origin from specifying a certain impact
scenario to achieving a Moon-forming synestia. Giant impacts that produce
potential Moon-forming synestias were common at the end of terrestrial planet
formation.

Bidirectional Beam Search with Gold path (BiBSG), an approximate inference

use of global information from both past and future to perform better local

non-degenerate companion before or after supernova explosion. Observationally,
some SNe Ia show such signal, while the others do not. Here, we propose a
universal model to explain these observations based on the spin-up/spin-down
model, in which a white dwarf (WD) will experience a spin-down phase before
supernova explosion, and the spin-down timescale is determined by its initial
mass, i.e. the more massive the initial WD, the shorter the spin-down timescale
and then the more likely the SN Ia to show the SD signature. Therefore, our
model predicts that the SNe Ia from hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon WDs are more
likely to show the SD signature observationally, as some peculiar SNe Ia
showed.

assess illness severity at any point during an ICU stay. We compare DeepSOFA
with SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) baseline models using the same
model inputs and find that at any point during an ICU admission, DeepSOFA
yields significantly more accurate predictions of in-hospital mortality. A
DeepSOFA model developed in a public database and validated in a single
institutional cohort had a mean AUC for the entire ICU stay of 0.90 (95% CI
0.90-0.91) compared with baseline SOFA models with mean AUC 0.79 (95% CI
0.79-0.80) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.85-0.86). Deep models are well-suited to identify
ICU patients in need of life-saving interventions prior to the occurrence of an
unexpected adverse event and inform shared decision-making processes among
patients, providers, and families regarding goals of care and optimal resource
utilization.

we propose a model referred to as Neural Aesthetic Image Reviewer, which can
not only give an aesthetic score for an image, but also generate a textual

Specifically, we propose two multi-task architectures based on shared
aesthetically semantic layers and task-specific embedding layers at a high

on this problem, we collect the AVA-Reviews dataset, which contains 52,118

technically ill-posed problem, with a large source of uncertainty coming from
the overall scale. We propose a fully convolutional-deconvolutional network
architecture being trained end-to-end, encompassing residual learning, to model
the ambiguous mapping between monocular remote sensing images and height maps.
Specifically, it is composed of two parts, i.e., convolutional sub-network and
deconvolutional sub-network. The former corresponds to feature extractor that
transforms the input remote sensing image to high-level multidimensional
feature representation, whereas the latter plays the role of a height generator
that produces height map from the feature extracted from the convolutional
sub-network. Moreover, to preserve fine edge details of estimated height maps,
we introduce a skip connection to the network, which is able to shuttle
low-level visual information, e.g., object boundaries and edges, directly
across the network. To demonstrate the usefulness of single-view height
prediction, we show a practical example of instance segmentation of buildings

of $\gamma$-ray emissions from resolved and unresolved extragalactic sources as
well as diffuse processes. It is important to study the statistical properties
of the EGB in the context of cosmological structure formation. Known
astrophysical $\gamma$-ray sources such as blazars, star-forming galaxies, and
radio galaxies are expected to trace the underlying cosmic matter density
distribution. We explore the correlation of the EGB from Fermi-LAT data with
the large-scale matter density distribution from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) SSP survey. We reconstruct an unbiased surface matter density
distribution $\kappa$ at $z<1$ by applying weak-gravitational lensing analysis
to the first-year HSC data. We then calculate the $\gamma - \kappa$
cross-correlation. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection, but a
weak correlation is found at angular scales of 30-60 arcmin, especially when
distant source galaxies at $z > 1$ are used for the lensing $\kappa$
reconstruction. The large-scale correlation suggests strong clustering of
high-redshift $\gamma$-ray sources such as blazars. However, the inferred bias
factor of $4-5$ is larger by about a factor of two than results from other
clustering analyses. The final HSC data covering 1,400 squared degrees will
play an essential role to determine accurately the blazar bias at $z > 0.5$.

equation approach with analytical solutions for any homogeneous spatial

increases the decay rate of magnons with low wave vectors to their thermal

magnetisation to its steady-state value. For long correlation lengths and
higher temperature we find that additionally there is a component of the
magnetisation which decays very slowly, due to a reduced decay rate of fast
magnons. This effect could be useful for fast and noise-protected quantum or
classical information transfer and magnonics. We further compare ferromagnetic

similar behaviour in Ohmic but fundamentally different behaviour in super-Ohmic

intelligence applications, e.g. computer vision, at the cost of a large number
of parameters and high computational complexity. Weight pruning can compress
DNN models by removing redundant parameters in the networks, but it brings
sparsity in the weight matrix, and therefore makes the computation inefficient
on GPUs. Although pruning can remove more than 80% of the weights, it actually
hurts inference performance (speed) when running models on GPUs.
  Two major problems cause this unsatisfactory performance on GPUs. First,
lowering convolution onto matrix multiplication reduces data reuse
opportunities and wastes memory bandwidth. Second, the sparsity brought by
pruning makes the computation irregular, which leads to inefficiency when
running on massively parallel GPUs. To overcome these two limitations, we
propose Escort, an efficient sparse convolutional neural networks on GPUs.
Instead of using the lowering method, we choose to compute the sparse
convolutions directly. We then orchestrate the parallelism and locality for the
direct sparse convolution kernel, and apply customized optimization techniques
to further improve performance. Evaluation on NVIDIA GPUs show that Escort can
improve sparse convolution speed by 2.63x and 3.07x, and inference speed by
1.43x and 1.69x, compared to CUBLAS and CUSPARSE respectively.

with those of observations. The multiplicative bias is calibrated to reach an
accuracy of $\sim$3.0%. We study the bias sensitivities to the undetected faint
galaxies and to the neighboring galaxies. We find that undetected galaxies
contribute to the multiplicative bias at the level of $\sim$0.3%. Further
analysis shows that galaxies with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are
impacted more significantly because the undetected galaxies skew the background
noise distribution. For the neighboring galaxies, we find that although most
have been rejected in the shape measurement procedure, about one third of them
still remain in the final shear sample. They show a larger ellipticity
dispersion and contribute to $\sim$0.2% of the multiplicative bias. Such a bias
can be removed by further eliminating these neighboring galaxies. But the
effective number density of the galaxies can be reduced considerably. Therefore
efficient methods should be developed for future weak lensing deep surveys.

allows the reconstruction of high angular resolution mass maps via weak
lensing, which is crucial for the weak lensing cluster search. We identify 65
mass map peaks with signal-to-noise (SN) ratio larger than 4.7, and carefully
examine their properties by cross-matching the clusters with optical and X-ray
cluster catalogs. We find that all the 39 peaks with SN$>5.1$ have counterparts
in the optical cluster catalogs, and only 2 out of the 65 peaks are probably
false positives. The upper limits of X-ray luminosities from ROSAT All Sky
Survey (RASS) imply the existence of an X-ray under-luminous cluster
population. We show that the X-rays from the shear selected clusters can be
statistically detected by stacking the RASS images. The inferred average X-ray
luminosity is about half that of the X-ray selected clusters of the same mass.
The radial profile of the dark matter distribution derived from the stacking
analysis is well modeled by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile with a small
concentration parameter value of $c_{500}\sim 2.5$, which suggests that the
selection bias on the orientation or the internal structure for our shear

and the behavior of high-density symmetry energy in medium and high energy
heavy-ion collisions are thoroughly discussed. The hypernuclide dynamics formed
in heavy-ion collisions and in hadron induced reactions is analyzed and
addressed in the future experiments at the High-Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator

of quasiparticles through beyond-mean-field effects at zero temperature. Here
we present the first analytical result of Beliaev damping in low-energy
excitations of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ interacting bosons with equal Rashba and
Dresslhaus spin-orbit couplings. We identify novel features of Beliaev decay
rate due to spin-orbit coupling, in particular, it shows explicit dependence on
the spin-density interaction and diverges at the interaction-modified phase
boundary between the zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. This represents a
manifestation of the effect of spin-orbit coupling in the beyond-mean-field
regime, which by breaking Galilean invariance couples excitations in the
density- and spin-channels. By describing the Beliaev damping in terms of the
observable dynamic structure factors, our results allow direct experimental
access within current facilities.

  We show through a set of simulation methods that semiMPC is, perhaps
surprisingly, equivalent to the congested clique model of distributed

another practically important dimension to optimize: the number of machines.
Furthermore, we show that algorithms in other distributed computing models,

common applications of neural networks, high order derivatives are not readily

analytical function inside 2D and 5D domains and solving Poisson equation
inside a 2D circle. For function approximation, the cost is a sum of squared
differences between output and target as well as their derivatives with respect

perceptron in place of unknown function and training its weights, so that
equation holds within some margin of error. Commonly used cost is the
equation's residual squared. Added terms are squared derivatives of said

the cost is minimized for points of regular grids with various spacing, and its

different rankings. Nevertheless, one can remove ""dominated"" items and create a
""representative"" subset of the data set, comprising the ""best items"" in it. A
Pareto-optimal representative is guaranteed to contain the best item of each
possible ranking, but it can be almost as big as the full data. Representative
can be found if we relax the requirement to include the best item for every
possible user, and instead just limit the users' ""regret"". Existing work
defines regret as the loss in score by limiting consideration to the
representative instead of the full data set, for any chosen ranking function.
  However, the score is often not a meaningful number and users may not
understand its absolute value. Sometimes small ranges in score can include
large fractions of the data set. In contrast, users do understand the notion of
rank ordering. Therefore, alternatively, we consider the position of the items
in the ranked list for defining the regret and propose the {\em rank-regret
representative} as the minimal subset of the data containing at least one of
the top-$k$ of any possible ranking function. This problem is NP-complete. We
use the geometric interpretation of items to bound their ranks on ranges of
functions and to utilize combinatorial geometry notions for developing
effective and efficient approximation algorithms for the problem. Experiments
on real datasets demonstrate that we can efficiently find small subsets with
small rank-regrets.

associated with preempting a job during execution. This cost can be from the
expensive task of saving the memory's state and loading data into and out of
memory. It is desirable to schedule jobs non-preemptively to avoid the costs of
preemption. There is a need for non-preemptive system schedulers on desktops,
servers and data centers. Despite this need, there is a gap between theory and
practice. Indeed, few non-preemptive \emph{online} schedulers are known to have
strong foundational guarantees. This gap is likely due to strong lower bounds
on any online algorithm for popular objectives. Indeed, typical worst case
analysis approaches, and even resource augmented approaches such as speed
augmentation, result in all algorithms having poor performance guarantees. This
paper considers on-line non-preemptive scheduling problems in the worst-case
rejection model where the algorithm is allowed to reject a small fraction of
jobs. By rejecting only a few jobs, this paper shows that the strong lower
bounds can be circumvented. This approach can be used to discover algorithmic
scheduling policies with desirable worst-case guarantees. Specifically, the
paper presents algorithms for the following two objectives: minimizing the
total flow-time and minimizing the total weighted flow-time plus energy under
the speed-scaling mechanism. The algorithms have a small constant competitive
ratio while rejecting only a constant fraction of jobs. Beyond specific
results, the paper asserts that alternative models beyond speed augmentation
should be explored to aid in the discovery of good schedulers in the face of
the requirement of being online and non-preemptive.

solution for millimeter wave (mm-wave) systems. While the number of radio
frequency (RF) chains has been effectively reduced in existing works, a large
number of high-precision phase shifters are still needed. Practical phase
shifters are with coarsely quantized phases, and their number should be reduced
to a minimum due to cost and power consideration. In this paper, we propose a
novel hardware-efficient implementation for hybrid precoding, called the fixed
phase shifter (FPS) implementation. It only requires a small number of phase
shifters with quantized and fixed phases. To enhance the spectral efficiency, a
switch network is put forward to provide dynamic connections from phase
shifters to antennas, which is adaptive to the channel states. An effective
alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm is developed with closed-form
solutions in each iteration to determine the hybrid precoder and the states of
switches. Moreover, to further reduce the hardware complexity, a
group-connected mapping strategy is proposed to reduce the number of switches.
Simulation results show that the FPS fully-connected hybrid precoder achieves
higher hardware efficiency with much fewer phase shifters than existing
proposals. Furthermore, the group-connected mapping achieves a good balance
between spectral efficiency and hardware complexity.

the second one consisting of two parallel quantum wires. The two conductors of
each system are electrically isolated and placed in the two circuits (the drive
and the drag) of a four-electrode setup. The systems are biased, either by a
temperature $\Delta T$ or a voltage $V$ difference, on the drive circuit, while
no biases are present on the drag circuit. In the case of a pair of metallic
islands we use a master equation approach to determine the general properties
of the dragged heat current $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$, accounting also for
co-tunneling contributions and the presence of large biases. Analytic results
are obtained in the sequential tunneling regime for small biases, finding, in
particular, that $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$ is quadratic in $\Delta T$ or $V$ and
non-monotonous as a function of the inter-island coupling. Finally, by
replacing one of the electrodes in the drag circuit with a superconductor, we
find that heat can be extracted from the other normal electrode. In the case of
the two interacting quantum wires, using the Luttinger liquid theory and the
bosonization technique, we derive an analytic expression for the thermal

atomically precise edges are emerging as mechanically and chemically robust
candidates for nanoscale light emitting devices of modulable emission color.
While their optical properties have been addressed theoretically in depth, only
few experimental studies exist, limited to ensemble measurements and without
any attempt to integrate them in an electronic-like circuit. Here we report on
the electroluminescence of individual GNRs suspended between the tip of a
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and a Au(111) substrate, constituting thus
a realistic opto-electronic circuit. Emission spectra of such GNR junctions
reveal a bright and narrow band emission of red light, whose energy can be
tuned with the bias voltage applied to the junction, but always lying below the
gap of infinite GNRs. Comparison with {\it ab initio} calculations indicate
that the emission involves electronic states localized at the GNR termini. Our
results shed light on unpredicted optical transitions in GNRs and provide a
promising route for the realization of bright, robust and controllable
graphene-based light emitting devices.

unfairness, where far nodes or nodes experiencing higher attenuation are less

periodic modulation in the X-ray flux with a pulse period of 31.6 s and a very
rapid spin-up, and confirm therefore that the compact object is a neutron star.
We find that the spin period is changing from 31.71 s to 31.54 s over that
period, with a spin-up rate of -5.56 x 10-7 s s-1, likely the largest ever
observed from an accreting neutron star. The spectrum is described by a
power-law and a disk black-body model, leading to a 0.3-30 keV unabsorbed
luminosity of 4.7 x 10^39 erg s-1. Applying our best-fit model successfully to
the spectra of an XMM-Newton observation from 2010, suggests that the lower
fluxes of NGC 300 ULX1 reported from observations around that time are caused
by a large amount of absorption, while the intrinsic luminosity was similar as
seen in 2016. A more constant luminosity level is also consistent with the
long-term pulse period evolution approaching an equilibrium value
asymptotically. We conclude that the source is another candidate for the new

much larger composite closed system, to treat them as effectively memory-less

should be the norm, the ubiquity of Markovian processes is undeniable. Here,
without resorting to the Born-Markov assumption of weak coupling or making any

when the subsystem is sufficiently small compared to the remainder of the
composite, with a probability that tends to unity exponentially in the size of

possible to neglect non-Markovian effects when the process is allowed to
continue for long enough. However, detecting non-Markovianity for such

have foundational importance, as they give birth to almost Markovian processes

in this report. In addition to the spin-dependent Seebeck effect that has been

behaviour for its thermal analog, the spin-dependent NE. The choice of lead
salts follows from a two-fold advantage they offer, in part, to their superior

spin-orbit coupling make them ideal candidates to study \textit{RSOC} in
nanostructures. The calculations show a larger longitudinal magneto-thermopower

In contrast, for a magnetic field free case, the related power factor
calculations reveal a significantly higher contribution from the spin-down
ensemble and suffer a reduction with an increase in the electron density. We
also discuss qualitatively the limitations of the semi-classical approach for
the extreme case of a high magnetic field and allude to the observed
thermopower behaviour when the quantum Hall regime is operational. Finally,
techniques to modulate the thermopower are briefly outlined.

subset of resources. Each resource has a fixed cost that has to be shared by
the players, and each agent has a nonshareable player-specific delay for each
resource. A prominent example is uncapacitated facility location (UFL), where
facilities need to be opened (at a shareable cost) and clients want to connect
to opened facilities. Each client pays a cost share and his non-shareable
physical connection cost. Given any profile of subsets allocated by the agents,
a separable cost sharing protocol determines cost shares that satisfy budget
balance on every resource and separability over the resources. Moreover, a
separable protocol guarantees existence of pure Nash equilibria in the induced
strategic game for the agents. In this paper, we study separable cost sharing
protocols in several general combinatorial domains. We provide black-box
reductions to reduce the design of a separable cost-sharing protocol to the
design of an approximation algorithm for the underlying cost minimization
problem. In this way, we obtain new separable cost-sharing protocols in games
based on arbitrary player-specific matroids, single-source connection games
without delays, and connection games on $n$-series-parallel graphs with delays.
All these reductions are efficiently computable - given an initial allocation
profile, we obtain a cheaper profile and separable cost shares turning the
profile into a pure Nash equilibrium. Hence, in these domains any approximation
algorithm can be used to obtain a separable cost sharing protocol with a price
of stability bounded by the approximation factor.

how the information on these response patterns are represented across multiple

multiscale relevance (MSR) -- to capture the dynamical variability of the
activity of single neurons across different time scales. The MSR is a
non-parametric, fully featureless indicator in that it uses only the time
stamps of the firing activity without resorting to any a priori covariate or
invoking any specific structure in the tuning curve for neural activity. When
applied to neural data from the mEC and from the ADn and PoS regions of
freely-behaving rodents, we found that neurons having low MSR tend to have low
mutual information and low firing sparsity across the correlates that are
believed to be encoded by the region of the brain where the recordings were
made. In addition, neurons with high MSR contain significant information on
spatial navigation and allow to decode spatial position or head direction as
efficiently as those neurons whose firing activity has high mutual information
with the covariate to be decoded and significantly better than the set of
neurons with high local variations in their interspike intervals. Given these
results, we propose that the MSR can be used as a measure to rank and select
neurons for their information content without the need to appeal to any a

predicted to induce an exotic picosecond spin dynamics. In particular,
conversely to what is observed in conventional metals and semiconductors, the
thermalization process in HMs leads to a long living partially thermalized
configuration characterized by three Fermi--Dirac distributions for the
minority, majority conduction and majority valence electrons respectively.
Remarkably, these distributions have the same temperature but different
chemical potentials. This unusual thermodynamics state causes a persistent
non-equilibrium spin polarization only well above the Fermi energy. Femtosecond
spin dynamics experiments performed on Fe$_3$O$_4$ by time-, spin-, and
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy confirm our model. Furthermore, the
spin polarization response proves to be very robust and it can be adopted to
selectively test the bulk HM character in a wide range of compounds.

compare the large scale distribution of light versus mass. A detection of this

sample remained inconclusive but allowed to develop a method, which we detail
here and use to conduct the second observational search. When using the same

are consistent with a null-detection, a result in tension with the strong
evidence previously measured with the DR10 data. This tension remains when we
use a more realistic model taking into account our knowledge of the survey flux
limit, as the data then privilege a zero effect. In the absence of CIPs, we
obtain a null detection consistent with both the absence of the effect and the
amplitude predicted in previous theoretical studies. This shows the necessity
of more accurate data in order to prove or disprove the theoretical

two-dimensional hydrodynamics. We derive an extension of this model that
describes more accurately the behaviour of a thin disc in the absence of
self-gravity, magnetic fields and complex internal motions. The ideal fluid
theory is derived directly from Hamilton's Principle for a three-dimensional
fluid after making a specific approximation to the deformation gradient tensor.
We express the equations in Eulerian form after projection on to a reference
plane. The disc is thought of as a set of fluid columns, each of which is
capable of a time-dependent affine transformation, consisting of a translation
together with a linear transformation in three dimensions. Therefore, in
addition to the usual two-dimensional hydrodynamics in the reference plane, the
theory allows for a deformation of the midplane (as occurs in warped discs) and
for the internal shearing motions that accompany such deformations. It also
allows for the vertical expansions driven in non-circular discs by a variation
of the vertical gravitational field around the horizontal streamlines, or by a
divergence of the horizontal velocity. The equations of the affine model embody
conservation laws for energy and potential vorticity, even for non-planar
discs. We verify that they reproduce exactly the linear theories of
three-dimensional warped and eccentric discs in a secular approximation.
However, the affine model does not rely on any secular or small-amplitude
assumptions and should be useful in more general circumstances.

forwards its received signals from all ground users to a central processor (CP)
for joint decoding. Moreover, we consider the case where the users may move on
the ground, thus the UAVs need to adjust their locations in accordance with the
user locations over time to maximize the network throughput. Utilizing random
matrix theory, we first characterize in closed-form a set of approximated upper
and lower bounds of the user's achievable rate in each time episode under a
realistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel model with random phase, which are shown
very tight both analytically and numerically. UAV placement and movement over
different episodes are then optimized based on the derived bounds to maximize
the minimum of user average achievable rates over all episodes for both cases

the user's movement. Interestingly, it is shown that the optimized location of
each UAV at any particular episode is the weighted average of the ground user
locations at the current episode as well as its own location at the previous

  Lightweight Virtual Machines specialized to run Containers","8 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Container technologies, like Docker, are becoming increasingly popular.
Containers provide exceptional developer experience because containers offer
lightweight isolation and ease of software distribution. Containers are also
widely used in production environments, where a different set of challenges
arise such as security, networking, service discovery and load balancing.
Container cluster management tools, such as Kubernetes, attempt to solve these
problems by introducing a new control layer with the container as the unit of
deployment. However, adding a new control layer is an extra configuration step
and an additional potential source of runtime errors. The virtual machine
technology offered by cloud providers is more mature and proven in terms of
security, networking, service discovery and load balancing. However, virtual
machines are heavier than containers for local development, are less flexible
for resource allocation, and suffer longer boot times. This paper presents an
alternative to containers that enjoy the best features of both approaches: (1)
the use of mature, proven cloud vendor technology; (2) no need for a new
control layer; and (3) as lightweight as containers. Our solution is i2kit, a
deployment tool based on the immutable infrastructure pattern, where the
virtual machine is the unit of deployment. The i2kit tool accepts a simplified
format of Kubernetes Deployment Manifests in order to reuse Kubernetes' most
successful principles, but it creates a lightweight virtual machine for each
Pod using Linuxkit. Linuxkit alleviates the drawback in size that using virtual
machines would otherwise entail, because the footprint of Linuxkit is
approximately 60MB. Finally, the attack surface of the system is reduced since

  Sporadic Task Systems",,,,,"cs.OS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The sporadic task model is often used to analyze recurrent execution of
identical tasks in real-time systems. A sporadic task defines an infinite
sequence of task instances, also called jobs, that arrive under the minimum
inter-arrival time constraint. To ensure the system safety, timeliness has to
be guaranteed in addition to functional correctness, i.e., all jobs of all
tasks have to be finished before the job deadlines. We focus on analyzing
arbitrary-deadline task sets on a homogeneous (identical) multiprocessor system
under any given global fixed-priority scheduling approach and provide a series
of schedulability tests with different tradeoffs between their time complexity
and their accuracy. Under the arbitrary-deadline setting, the relative deadline
of a task can be longer than the minimum inter-arrival time of the jobs of the
task. We show that global deadline-monotonic (DM) scheduling has a speedup
bound of $3-1/M$ against any optimal scheduling algorithms, where $M$ is the
number of identical processors, and prove that this bound is asymptotically
tight.

functional to the time domain is used to study the effect of the internal
spin-torque on the laser induced spin-dynamics in bulk Co, Ni and interfaces of

significantly to spin-dynamics only when the magneto crystalline anisotropy

to cause any significant precession of spins in early times ($<$ 100fs).

importance of finding a maximum subgraph avoiding a fixed pattern, we introduce
and initiate the parameterized study of the Strong F-closure problem, where F
is a fixed graph. This is a generalization of Strong Triadic Closure, whereas
it is a relaxation of F-free Edge Deletion. In Strong F-closure, we want to
select a maximum number of edges of the input graph G, and mark them as strong
edges, in the following way: whenever a subset of the strong edges forms a
subgraph isomorphic to F, then the corresponding induced subgraph of G is not
isomorphic to F. Hence the subgraph of G defined by the strong edges is not
necessarily F-free, but whenever it contains a copy of F, there are additional
edges in G to destroy that strong copy of F in G.
  We study Strong F-closure from a parameterized perspective with various
natural parameterizations. Our main focus is on the number k of strong edges as
the parameter. We show that the problem is FPT with this parameterization for
every fixed graph F, whereas it does not admit a polynomial kernel even when F
=P_3. In fact, this latter case is equivalent to the Strong Triadic Closure
problem, which motivates us to study this problem on input graphs belonging to
well known graph classes. We show that Strong Triadic Closure does not admit a
polynomial kernel even when the input graph is a split graph, whereas it admits
a polynomial kernel when the input graph is planar, and even d-degenerate.
Furthermore, on graphs of maximum degree at most 4, we show that Strong Triadic
Closure is FPT with the above guarantee parameterization k - \mu(G), where
\mu(G) is the maximum matching size of G. We conclude with some results on the
parameterization of Strong F-closure by the number of edges of G that are not

calculated the steady state current density-voltage ($J-V$) and the
$J_\mathrm{sc}-\Delta E$ curves under two different charge separation
mechanisms to investigate the optimum driving force required for achieving
sizable $V_\mathrm{oc}$ and $J_\mathrm{sc}$ simultaneously. Under the Marcus
charge transfer mechanism, with the increased $\Delta E$ the Jsc increases
rapidly for $\Delta E\leq 0.2$ eV, and then maintains a nearly constant value
before decreasing at the Marcus inverted region, which is due to the
accumulation of undissociated excitons within their lifetime and is beneficial
for obtaining a sizable $J_\mathrm{sc}$ under a $\Delta E$ much smaller than
the reorganization energy $\lambda$. For the coherent charge transfer mechanism
in which the driving force act as the energy window of accessible charge
separated states, with two typical types of density of states for the charge
transfer excitons, it is shown that the highest $J_\mathrm{sc}$ can also be
achieved under a small $\Delta E$ of 0.2\,eV if the high-lying delocalized

mechanical mode and a strong entanglement between the mechanical and atomic
modes without the necessity of using squeezed light injection. Furthermore, the
QOC changes the effective oscillation frequencies of both the mechanical and
the atomic modes and affects their relaxation times. It can also make the
system switch form optical bistability to tristability

turbulent closed-conduit flow by two-dimensional triangular ripples. Two ripple
configurations were employed: one single asymmetric triangular ripple, and two
consecutive asymmetric triangular ripples, all of them with the same geometry.
Different water flows were imposed over either one or two ripples fixed to the
bottom wall of a closed conduit, and the flow field was measured by PIV
(particle image velocimetry). Reynolds numbers based on the channel height were
moderate, varying between 27500 and 34700. The regime was hydraulically smooth,
and the blockage ratio was significant. Experimental data for this specific
case remain scarce, and the physics involved has yet to be fully elucidated.
Using the instantaneous flow fields, the mean velocities and fluctuations were
computed, and the shear stresses over the ripples were determined. The
velocities and stresses obtained in this way for the single ripple and for the
pair of ripples are compared, and the surface shear stress is discussed in
terms of bed stability. Our results show that for the single and upstream
ripples the shear stress increases at the leading edge and decreases toward the
crest, while for the downstream ripple it decreases monotonically between the
reattachment point and the crest. The stress distribution over the downstream
ripple, which is different from both the upstream and single ripples, is shown
to sustain existing ripples over loose beds.

unexpectedly even $\sim$ 160 days after the associated gravitational burst.
Here we suggest that the brightening can be caused by a late-time energy
injection process. We use an empirical expression to mimic the evolution of the
injection luminosity, which is consisted of a power-law rising phase and a
power-law decreasing phase. It is found that the power-law indices of the two
phases are $0.92$ and $-2.8$, respectively, with the peak time of the injection
being $\sim 110$ days. The energy injection could be due to some kind of
accretion, with the total accreted mass being $\sim 0.006 M_\odot$. However,
normal fall-back accretion, which usually lasts for a much shorter period,
cannot provide a natural explanation. Our best-fit decaying index of $-2.8$ is
also at odds with the expected value of $-5/3$ for normal fall-back accretion.
Noting that the expansion velocities of the kilonova components associated with
GW170817 is $0.1-0.3\,c$, we argue that there should also be some ejecta with
correspondingly lower velocities during the coalescence of the double neutron
star system. They are bound by the gravitational well of the remnant central
compact object and might be accreted at a timescale of about 100 days,
providing a reasonable explanation for the energy injection. Detailed studies
on the long-lasting brightening of GRB 170817A thus may provide useful
information on the matter ejection during the merger process of binary neutron
stars.

Both in noiseless and local noisy scenarios, we find one-shot quantum
capacities of these channels in terms of fidelity, when the initial shared
states in each block are the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and the
generalized W states. We also consider a situation where optimal local
measurements transform multipartite states to bipartite ones which can then be
used as single-path channels for quantum state transmission in each segment. We
show that in some parameter ranges, the former protocol provides strictly
better fidelities than that of the latter, thereby establishing the importance
of distributing and concentrating arbitrary quantum states via multipartite
entangled states in long distance quantum communication, over the local
measurement based protocol. Moreover, we show that in presence of bit flip or
bit-phase flip noise, shared generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
possess an inherent noise detection and correction mechanism, leading to the
same fidelity as in the noiseless case. We consider further noise models also,
which do not enjoy the same mechanism. In addition to the fidelity based
advantages, the multipath scheme is shown to be useful when one considers a
situation in which the completion of the teleportation needs to be delayed. We
also find the efficiencies of a quantum channel when a quantum state is

Minimization of this information theoretic bound reduces the redundancy between

strikingly prevalent within ACPA (100%) compared to somatically hypermutated

seropositive (39%) and seronegative RA (7%). When normalized for SHM, ACPA
still had significantly higher frequency of N-linked motifs compared to all
studied mAbs including highly-mutated HIV broadly-neutralizing and
malaria-associated mAbs. The Fab glycans of ACPA-mAbs were highly sialylated,
contributed to altered charge, but did not influence antigen binding. The

SHM-mediated decreased in surface charge and isoelectric point in ACPA. It is

edge)-weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices, a root vertex $r$ and a
collection of groups $\{S_i\}_{i\in[h]}: S_i\subseteq V(G)$. The goal is to
find a min-cost subgraph $H$ that connects the root to every group. We consider
a fault-tolerant variant of GST, which we call Restricted (Rooted) Group SNDP.
In this setting, each group $S_i$ has a demand $k_i\in[k],k\in\mathbb N$, and
we wish to find a min-cost $H\subseteq G$ such that, for each group $S_i$,
there is a vertex in $S_i$ connected to the root via $k_i$ (vertex or edge)
disjoint paths.
  While GST admits $O(\log^2 n\log h)$ approximation, its high connectivity
variants are Label-Cover hard, and for the vertex-weighted version, the
hardness holds even when $k=2$. Previously, positive results were known only
for the edge-weighted version when $k=2$ [Gupta et al., SODA 2010; Khandekar et
al., Theor. Comput. Sci., 2012] and for a relaxed variant where the disjoint
paths may end at different vertices in a group [Chalermsook et al., SODA 2015].
  Our main result is an $O(\log n\log h)$ approximation for Restricted Group
SNDP that runs in time $n^{f(k, w)}$, where $w$ is the treewidth of $G$. This
nearly matches the lower bound when $k$ and $w$ are constant. The key to
achieving this result is a non-trivial extension of the framework in
[Chalermsook et al., SODA 2017], which embeds all feasible solutions to the
problem into a dynamic program (DP) table. However, finding the optimal
solution in the DP table remains intractable. We formulate a linear program
relaxation for the DP and obtain an approximate solution via randomized
rounding. This framework also allows us to systematically construct DP tables
for high-connectivity problems. As a result, we present new exact algorithms
for several variants of survivable network design problems in low-treewidth
graphs.

A Coordinate Transformation which Maintains the Period of Clocks is introduced,
and such coordinate transformation is named as CTMPC throughout this paper. By
analogy with the Lorentz transformation in Minkowski space-time, CTMPC is a
correct transformation in curved space-times in a sense that it shows the
correct relation between the time measured by the two observers, moreover,
Lorentz transformation is just a special case of CTMPC applied in Minkowski
space-time. We demonstrate that the Coordinate Transformation which Maintains
the Local Metric (CTMLM) is one CTMPC, while the mathematical forms of physics
formulas in QFT will be maintained. As applications of CTMLM, the time dilation
and Doppler effect with an arbitrary time-dependent relative velocity in curved
space-time are analysed. For Minkowski space-time, the time dilation and
Doppler effect agree with the clock hypothesis. For curved space-time, we show
that even if the emitted wave has a narrow frequency range, the Doppler effect
may, in general, broaden the frequency spectrum and, at the meantime, shift the
frequencies values. These new findings will deepen our understanding on the
nature of space-time and the Doppler effect in curved space-time, they may also

to optimally use the limited degrees of freedom (DoFs) to send data and control

acknowledgement (ACK). We compare the detection/decoding performance of two
short packet structures: (1) time-multiplexed detection sequence and data; and
(2) structure in which both packet detection and data decoding use all DoFs.
Specifically, as an instance of the second structure we use superimposed
sequences for detection and data. We derive the probabilities of false alarm
and misdetection for an AWGN channel and numerically minimize the packet error
probability (PER), showing that for delay-constrained data and ACK exchange,
there is a tradeoff between the resources spent for detection and decoding. We
show that the optimal PER for the superimposed structure is achieved for higher
detection overhead. For this reason, the PER is also higher than in the
preamble case. However, the superimposed structure is advantageous due to its
flexibility to achieve optimal operation without the need to use multiple

conflicts, we conducted a behavioural study exposing 33 subjects to congruent
and incongruent dynamic audio-visual cues. In contrast to previous studies
using simplified stimuli, we designed a scenario with four animated avatars and
observed that the magnitude and extension of the visual bias are related to the
semantics embedded in the scene, i.e., visual cues that are congruent with
environmental statistics (moving lips and vocalization) induce the strongest
bias. We implement a deep learning model that processes stereophonic sound,
facial features, and body motion to trigger a discrete behavioural response.
After training the model, we exposed the iCub to the same experimental
conditions as the human subjects, showing that the robot can replicate similar
responses in real time. Our interdisciplinary work provides important insights
into how crossmodal conflict resolution can be modelled in robots and
introduces future research directions for the efficient combination of sensory

Distance entropy defines a new centrality measure whose properties are
investigated for a variety of synthetic network models. By coupling distance
entropy information with closeness centrality, we introduce a network
cartography which allows one to reduce the degeneracy of ranking based on
closeness alone. We apply this methodology to the empirical multiplex lexical
network encoding the linguistic relationships known to English speaking
toddlers. We show that the distance entropy cartography better predicts how
children learn words compared to closeness centrality. Our results highlight
the importance of distance entropy for gaining insights from distance patterns

non-distributivity of the lattice of subspaces, there are various levels of
independence, from pairwise independence up to (full) independence. Pairwise
totalness, totalness and other intermediate concepts are also introduced, which
roughly express that the subspaces overlap strongly among themselves, and they
cover the full Hilbert space. A duality between independence and totalness,
that involves orthocomplementation (logical NOT operation), is discussed.
Another approach to independence is also studied, using Rota's formalism on
independent partitions of the Hilbert space. This is used to define
informational independence, which is proved to be equivalent to independence.
As an application, the pentagram (used in discussions on contextuality) is
analyzed using these concepts.

which has been applied to problems in optimization, machine learning, data

connections between any two layers in the same block. The layers are
constructed as a loop and are updated alternately. The CliqueNet has some
unique properties. For each layer, it is both the input and output of any other
layer in the same block, so that the information flow among layers is
maximized. During propagation, the newly updated layers are concatenated to
re-update previously updated layer, and parameters are reused for multiple
times. This recurrent feedback structure is able to bring higher level visual
information back to refine low-level filters and achieve spatial attention. We
analyze the features generated at different stages and observe that using
refined features leads to a better result. We adopt a multi-scale feature
strategy that effectively avoids the progressive growth of parameters.
Experiments on image recognition datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN

neutron capture effects, Pt isotopes have emerged as a reliable in-situ neutron
dosimeter. This study applies this method to IAB iron meteorites, in order to
constrain the timing of metal segregation on the IAB parent body. The

corresponds to a metal-silicate separation age of 6.0 $\pm$ 0.8 Ma after CAI
for the IAB parent body, and is interpreted to represent a body-wide melting
event. Later, between 10 and 14 Ma after CAI, an impact led to a catastrophic
break-up and subsequent reassembly of the parent body. Thermal models of the
interior evolution that are consistent with these estimates suggest that the
IAB parent body underwent metal-silicate separation as a result of internal
heating by short-lived radionuclides and accreted at around 1.4 $\pm$ 0.1 Ma

pressure and obliquity on the possibility of surface water, we created a
zero-dimensional surface energy balance model. We combine this model with
physically consistent orbital histories to track conditions over the last 3.5
Gyr of Martian history. We find that melting is allowed for atmospheric
pressures corresponding to exponential loss rates of $dP/dt \propto t^{-3.73}$
or faster, but this rate is within $0.5 \sigma$ of the rate calculated from
initial measurements made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)
mission, if we assume all the escaping oxygen measured by MAVEN comes from
atmospheric CO$_{2}$ (Lillis et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2015). Melting at this
loss rate matches selected key geologic constraints on the formation of
Hesperian river networks, assuming optimal melt conditions during the warmest
part of each Mars year (Irwin et al., 2015; Stopar et al., 2006; Kite et al.,
2017a,b). The atmospheric pressure has a larger effect on the surface energy
than changes in Mars's mean obliquity. These results show that initial
measurements of atmosphere loss by MAVEN are consistent with atmospheric loss
being the dominant process that switched Mars from a melt-permitting to a
melt-absent climate (Jakosky et al., 2017), but non-CO$_{2}$ warming will be
required if $<2$ Gya paleochannels are confirmed, or if most of the escaping
oxygen measured by MAVEN comes from H$_{2}$O.

recording the backward and forward emitted second harmonic signals from

transmit the collected data packets through routes to the sinks. In this study,
we propose a mixed--integer linear programming (MILP) model to maximize the
number of time periods that a WSN carries out the desired tasks with limited
energy and budget. Our sink and sensor placement, scheduling, routing with
connected coverage ($SPSRC$) model is the first in the literature that combines
the decisions for the locations of sinks and sensors, activity schedules of the
deployed sensors, and data flow routes from each active sensor to its assigned
sink for connected coverage of the network over a finite planning horizon. The
problem is NP--hard and difficult to solve even for small instances. Assuming
that the sink locations are known, we develop heuristics which construct a
feasible solution of the problem by gradually satisfying the constraints. Then,
we introduce search heuristics to determine the locations of the sinks to
maximize the network lifetime. Computational experiments reveal that our
heuristic methods can find near optimal solutions in an acceptable amount of
time compared to the commercial solver CPLEX 12.7.0.

quantum mechanical, field, gauge or string theories, is a non-trivial problem
which in many cases can only be addressed by resorting to perturbative methods.
In most physically interesting problems these perturbative expansions result in
asymptotic series with zero radius of convergence. These asymptotic series then
require the use of resurgence and transseries in order for the associated
observables to become nonperturbatively well-defined. Resurgence encodes the
complete large-order asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients from a
perturbative expansion, generically in terms of (multi) instanton sectors and
for each problem in terms of its Stokes constants. Some observables arise from
linear problems, and have a finite number of instanton sectors and associated
Stokes constants; some other observables arise from nonlinear problems, and
have an infinite number of instanton sectors and Stokes constants. By means of
two very explicit examples, and with emphasis on a pedagogical style of
presentation, this work aims at serving as a primer on the aforementioned
resurgent, large-order asymptotics of general perturbative expansions. This
includes discussions of transseries, Stokes phenomena, generalized
steepest-descent methods, Borel transforms, nonlinear resonance, and alien
calculus. Furthermore, resurgent properties of transseries---usually described

is found to depend on the disc cooling rate, planet mass, grain size and
irradiative feedback from the planet. If radiative cooling is efficient,
planets accrete both gas and pebbles rapidly, open a gap and usually become
massive brown dwarfs. In the inefficient cooling case, gas is too hot to
accrete onto the planet but pebble accretion continues and the planets migrate
inward rapidly. Radiative feedback from the planet tends to suppress gas
accretion. Our simulations predict that metal enrichment of planets by dust
grain accretion inversely correlates with the final planet mass, in accordance
with the observed trend in the inferred bulk composition of Solar System and
exosolar giant planets. To account for observations, however, as much as
~30-50% of the dust mass should be in the form of large grains.

We address the open issue of interference coordination for sub-28 GHz
millimeter-wave communication, by proposing fast-converging coordination
algorithms, for dense multi-user multi-cell networks. We propose to optimize a
lower bound on the network sum-rate, after investigating its tightness. The
bound in question results in distributed optimization, requiring local
information at each base station and user. We derive the optimal solution to
the transmit and receive filter updates, that we dub non-homogeneous
waterfilling, and show its convergence to a stationary point of the bound. We
also underline a built-in mechanism to turn-off data streams with low-SINR, and
allocate power to high-SNR streams. This ""stream control"" is a at the root of
the fast-converging nature of the algorithm. Our numerical result conclude that
low-overhead coordination offers large gains, for dense sub-$28$ GHz systems.
These findings bear direct relevance to the ongoing discussions around 5G New

has been the holy grail in statistical physics ever since the mid-19th century.
Here the central question concerns the arrow of time, which boils down to
deriving macroscopic emergent irreversibility from microscopic reversible
equations of motion. As suggested by Boltzmann, this irreversibility amounts to
improbability (rather than impossibility) of the second-law-violating events.
Later studies suggest that this improbability arises from a fractal attractor
which is dynamically generated in phase space in reversible dissipative
systems. However, the same mechanism seems inapplicable to reversible
conservative systems, since a zero-volume fractal attractor is incompatible
with the nonzero phase-space volume, which is a constant of motion due to the
Liouville theorem. Here we demonstrate that in a Hamiltonian system the fractal
scaling emerges transiently over an intermediate length scale. Notably, this
transient fractality is unveiled by invoking the Loschmidt demon with an
imperfect accuracy. Moreover, we show that irreversibility from the fractality
can be evaluated by means of information theory and the fluctuation theorem.
The fractality provides a unified understanding of emergent irreversibility
over an intermediate time scale regardless of whether the underlying reversible
dynamics is dissipative or conservative.

off in errors where the stochastic error is reduced at the cost of an increase
in deterministic/discretization errors in the evaluation of the surrogate. Such

work, we formulate a method for adaptively creating a special class of

these two levels of surrogates, appropriately derived local error indicators
are computed and used to guide refinement of both levels of the surrogates.
Three types of refinement strategies are presented and combined in an iterative

two applications. First, we resolve a known problem in the estimation of
mortality as a function of education: because individuals with high school or
less are a smaller and thus more negatively selected group over time, estimates
of their mortality change are likely to be biased. Our method makes it possible
to hold education rank bins constant over time, revealing that current
estimates of rising mortality for less educated women are biased upward in some
cases by a factor of three. Second, we apply the method to the estimation of
intergenerational mobility, where researchers frequently use coarsely measured
education data in the many contexts where matched parent-child income data are
unavailable. Conventional measures like the rank-rank correlation may be
uninformative once interval censoring is taken into account; CEF interval-based

whose complexity is irrelevant to the kernel size, many techniques have been
proposed, such as 2D box filtering, dimension promotion, and shiftability

efficiency problems, previous algorithm designers were used to take only one of
them to assemble fast implementations due to the hardness of combining them

problem of multichannel guided image filtering and yields competent results
when applying it to multi-label problems with synthesized polynomial
multichannel guidance. Specifically, in order to boost the filtering
performance, HGF takes a new matrix inverse algorithm which only involves two
hardware-efficient operations: element-wise arithmetic calculations and box
filtering. In order to break the linear model restriction, HGF synthesizes a
polynomial multichannel guidance to introduce nonlinearity. Benefiting from our
polynomial guidance and hardware-efficient matrix inverse algorithm, HGF not
only is more sensitive to the underlying structure of guidance but also
achieves the fastest computing speed. Due to these merits, HGF obtains
state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and efficiency in the computation

such media, we investigate the dependent scattering effects, including the
effect of modification of the electric and magnetic dipole excitations and the
far-field interference effect, both induced and influenced by the structural
correlations. We study in detail how the structural correlations play a role in
the dependent scattering mechanism by using two types of particle system, i.e.,
the hard-sphere system and the sticky-hard-sphere system. We show that the
inverse stickiness parameter, which controls the interparticle adhesive force
and thus the particle correlations, can tune the radiative properties
significantly. Particularly, increasing the surface stickiness can result in a
higher scattering coefficient and a larger asymmetry factor. The results also
imply that in the present system, the far-field interference effect plays a
dominant role in the radiative properties while the effect of modification of
the electric and magnetic dipole excitations is more subtle. Our study is
promising in understanding and manipulating the radiative properties of

cervical, ovarian, vaginal and vulvar cancers, is more than 6% internationally
[1]. In many countries external radiotherapy is supplemented by brachytherapy
with high locally administered doses as standard. The superior ability of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate soft tissue has led to an
increasing use of this imaging technique in the intraoperative planning and
implementation of brachytherapy. A technical challenge associated with the use
of MRI imaging for brachytherapy - in contrast to computed tomography (CT)
imaging - is the dark-diffuse appearance and thus difficult identification of
the catheter paths in the resulting images. This problem is addressed by the
precise method described herein of tracing the catheters from the catheter tip.
The average identification time for a single catheter path was three seconds on
a standard PC. Segmentation time, accuracy and precision are promising
indicators of the value of this method for the clinical application of
image-guided gynecological brachytherapy. After surgery (OP), the healthy
surrounding tissue of the tumor is usually irradiated. This reduces the risk of
leaving behind residual cells that would likely cause a recurrence of the
cancer or the formation of metastases - secondary tumors elsewhere in the body.
In the case of a tumor on the cervix or prostate, the operation is minimally
invasive, ie. the removal of the cancer and the irradiation are performed
cost-effectively and risk-avoiding by keyhole surgery instead of open surgery.

a fundamental task in computational biology. In this paper, we focus on one
such metric, the $\ell^\infty$-cophenetic metric introduced by Cardona et al.
This metric works by representing a phylogenetic tree with $n$ labeled leaves
as a point in $\mathbb{R}^{n(n+1)/2}$ known as the cophenetic vector, then
comparing the two resulting Euclidean points using the $\ell^\infty$ distance.
Meanwhile, the interleaving distance is a formal categorical construction
generalized from the definition of Chazal et al., originally introduced to
compare persistence modules arising from the field of topological data
analysis. We show that the $\ell^\infty$-cophenetic metric is an example of an
interleaving distance. To do this, we define phylogenetic trees as a category
of merge trees with some additional structure; namely labelings on the leaves
plus a requirement that morphisms respect these labels. Then we can use the
definition of a flow on this category to give an interleaving distance.
Finally, we show that, because of the additional structure given by the
categories defined, the map sending a labeled merge tree to the cophenetic
vector is, in fact, an isometric embedding, thus proving that the

porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. Effective medium theory (EMT) has
been applied to analyzing the optical properties of the air-doped porous
medium. The composite structure is specifically optimized so that it has a high
absorbance (emittance) in the far-infrared atmospheric window and nearly no
loss in the solar spectrum. The calculated emittance is well reproduced in the
experiment by our AAO sample. The fabricated porous membrane shows a potential
cooling power density of 64 W/m2 at ambient (humidity = 75%) under direct
sunlight irradiance (AM1.5). Experimentally, the sample is cooled by a 2.6C
temperature reduction below the ambient air temperature in the sunlight. This
performance shows little variance at night. The AAO approach proposed here may
provide a promising way to produce low-cost and efficient radiative cooler in
large scales for feasible energy conservation.

  Multiplexer based on Multi-Plane Light Conversion","Follow-up of OFC PDP publication. Upgraded version",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Space Division Multiplexing (SMD) is a very attractive technique for
addressing the ever-growing demands in transmission capacity by enabling the
use of a new parameter \textemdash\ space \textemdash\ to increase the number
of channels in multi-mode fibers. One key component to build a spatially
multiplexed-based optical network is a spatial multiplexer and demultiplexer
combining signals from multiple single-mode fibers into as many channels in a
multi-mode fiber. In this article, we report the fabrication and
characterization of a pair of 45-mode spatial multiplexer and demultiplexer
saturating all the modes of a standard 50~$\mu$m core graded-index (OM2)
multi-mode fiber. The multiplexers are based on Multi-Plane Light Conversion
(MPLC), a technique that enables the control of the transverse shape of the
light by multiple reflections on specifically designed phase plates. We show
that by using a separable variable basis of modes, such as Hermite-Gaussian
(HG) modes, we are able to drastically reduce the number of reflections hence
reducing the insertion losses and modal crosstalks. The multiplexers typically
show an average 4~dB insertion loss and -28~dB cross-talk across the C band.
Finally, we emphasize the use of this higher-order modes multiplexer to explore
the propagation properties inside multi-mode fibers and more specifically the
mode group crosstalks as well as the impact of fiber bending.
