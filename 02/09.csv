where all the five Fe 3$d$ orbitals get involved. The multiple-orbital nature
gives rise to various novel phenomena like orbital-selective Mott transition,
nematicity and orbital fluctuation that provide a new route for realizing
superconductivity. The complexity of multiple-orbital also asks to disentangle
the relationship between orbital, spin and nematicity, and to identify dominant
orbital ingredients that dictate superconductivity. The bulk FeSe
superconductor provides an ideal platform to address these issues because of
its simple crystal structure and unique coexistence of superconductivity and
nematicity. However, the orbital nature of the low energy electronic
excitations and its relation to the superconducting gap remain controversial.
Here we report direct observation of highly anisotropic Fermi surface and
extremely anisotropic superconducting gap in the nematic state of FeSe
superconductor by high resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission
measurements. We find that the low energy excitations of the entire hole pocket
at the Brillouin zone center are dominated by the single $d_{xz}$ orbital. The
superconducting gap exhibits an anti-correlation relation with the $d_{xz}$
spectral weight near the Fermi level, i.e., the gap size minimum (maximum)
corresponds to the maximum (minimum) of the $d_{xz}$ spectral weight along the
Fermi surface. These observations provide new insights in understanding the
orbital origin of the extremely anisotropic superconducting gap in FeSe
superconductor and the relation between nematicity and superconductivity in the
iron-based superconductors.

minimization of a linear objective over a set of linear constraints together
with additional linear complementarity constraints. This class has emerged as a
modeling paradigm for a broad collection of problems, including bilevel
programs, Stackelberg games, inverse quadratic programs, and problems involving
equilibrium constraints. The presence of the complementarity constraints
results in a nonconvex optimization problem. We develop a branch-and-cut
algorithm to find a global optimum for this class of optimization problems,
where we branch directly on complementarities. We develop branching rules and
feasibility recovery procedures and demonstrate their computational
effectiveness in a comparison with CPLEX. The implementation builds on CPLEX
through the use of callback routines. The computational results show that our
approach is a strong alternative to constructing an integer programming
formulation using big-$M$ terms to represent bounds for variables, with testing
conducted on general LPCCs as well as on instances generated from bilevel
programs with convex quadratic lower level problems.

atmosphere models incorporate a new equation of state to describe spectral
features of low-temperature stellar atmospheres. Since T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H]
show degeneracies, the surface gravity is determined independently using
stellar evolutionary models. We derive the stellar parameters for a total of
300 stars. The fits achieve very good agreement between the PHOENIX models and

improved in the last years. Our work also provides an independent test of the
new PHOENIX-ACES models, and a comparison for other methods using
low-resolution spectra. In particular, our effective temperatures agree well
with literature values, while metallicities determined with our method exhibit

2 and 20 $\mu m$. For thickness to length (T/L) ratios of 1/10 or less, pairs
of triangles preferentially bind in either a tip-to-tip or tip-to-midpoint edge
configurations; for pairs of particles of thickness T/L = 1/5, the tip of one
triangle binds to any position along the other triangle's edge. The distinct
binding configurations for small T/L ratios result from physical bowing of the
prisms, a property that arises during their fabrication. When bowed prisms are
placed at the air-water interface, two distinct polarity states arise: prisms
either sit with their center of mass above or below the interface. The
interface pins to the edge of the prism's concave face, resulting in an
interface profile that is similar to that of a capillary hexapole, but with
important deviations close to the particle that enable directed binding. We
present corresponding theoretical and numerical analysis of the capillary
interactions between these prisms and show how particle bowing and contact-line
pinning yield a capillary hexapole-like interaction that results in the two
sets of distinct, highly-directional binding events. Prisms of all T/L ratios
self-assemble into space-spanning open networks; the results suggest design

informed/explainable decisions in the domain of time-series, powered by deep
learning. There have been numerous efforts to increase the interpretability of
image-centric deep neural network models, where the learned features are more
intuitive to visualize. Visualization in time-series domain is much more
complicated as there is no direct interpretation of the filters and inputs as
compared to the image modality. In addition, little or no concentration has
been devoted for the development of such tools in the domain of time-series in
the past. TSViz provides possibilities to explore and analyze a network from
different dimensions at different levels of abstraction which includes
identification of parts of the input that were responsible for a prediction
(including per filter saliency), importance of different filters present in the
network for a particular prediction, notion of diversity present in the network
through filter clustering, understanding of the main sources of variation
learnt by the network through inverse optimization, and analysis of the
network's robustness against adversarial noise. As a sanity check for the
computed influence values, we demonstrate results regarding pruning of neural
networks based on the computed influence information. These representations
allow to understand the network features so that the acceptability of deep
networks for time-series data can be enhanced. This is extremely important in
domains like finance, industry 4.0, self-driving cars, health-care,
counter-terrorism etc., where reasons for reaching a particular prediction are
equally important as the prediction itself. We assess the proposed framework
for interpretability with a set of desirable properties essential for any
method.

are rewarded not only based on offloaded data volume but also based on the
quality of their offloading service. The interactions between WiFi APs and the
MNO under this incentive mechanism are then studied using Stackelberg game. By
differentiating whether WiFi APs are of the same type (e.g. offloading cost and
quality), two cases (homogeneous and heterogeneous) are studied. For both
cases, we derive the best response functions for WiFi APs (i.e. the optimal
amount of data to offload), and show that the Nash Equilibrium (NE) always
exists for the subgame. Then, given WiFi APs' strategies, we investigate the
optimal strategy (i.e. the optimal salary and bonus) for the MNO to maximize
its utility. Then, two simple incentive mechanisms, referred to as the
salary-only scheme and the bonus-only scheme, are presented and studied using
Stackelberg game. For both of them, it is shown that the Stackelberg
Equilibrium (SE) exists and is unique. We also show that the salary-only scheme
is more effective in offloading more data, and the bonus-only scheme is more
effective in selecting premium APs (i.e. providing high-quality offloading
service at low cost), while the salary-plus-bonus scheme can strike a well
balance between the offloaded data volume and the offloading quality.

critical values of motivic $L$-functions and the multiplicative relations
between periods of arithmetically normalized automorphic forms on unitary
groups. In the first place, we combine the Ichino--Ikeda--Neal-Harris (IINH)
formula -- which is now a theorem -- with an analysis of cup products of
coherent cohomological automorphic forms on Shimura varieties to establish
relations between certain automorphic periods and critical values of
Rankin-Selberg and Asai $L$-functions of ${\rm GL}(n)\times{\rm GL}(m)$ over CM
fields. By reinterpreting these critical values in terms of automorphic periods
of holomorphic automorphic forms on unitary groups, we show that the
automorphic periods of holomorphic forms can be factored as products of
coherent cohomological forms, compatibly with a motivic factorization predicted
by the Tate conjecture. All of these results are conditional on a conjecture on
non-vanishing of twists of automorphic $L$-functions of ${\rm GL}(n)$ by
anticyclotomic characters of finite order, and are stated under a certain
regularity condition.

IDEs, and so on. The few compilers that avoid these problems suffer poor
performance and are difficult to engineer.
  This paper presents Stopify, a source-to-source compiler that extends
JavaScript with debugging abstractions and blocking operations, and easily
integrates with existing compilers. We apply Stopify to 10 programming
languages and develop a Web IDE that supports stopping, single-stepping,
breakpointing, and long-running computations. For nine languages, Stopify
requires no or trivial compiler changes. For eight, our IDE is the first that
provides these features. Two of our subject languages have compilers with
similar features. Stopify's performance is competitive with these compilers and
it makes them dramatically simpler.
  Stopify's abstractions rely on first-class continuations, which it provides
by compiling JavaScript to JavaScript. We also identify sub-languages of
JavaScript that compilers implicitly use, and exploit these to improve
performance. Finally, Stopify needs to repeatedly interrupt and resume program
execution. We use a sampling-based technique to estimate program speed that

i.e., for cavities with perturbed geometry. The main contribution of the paper
is ensuring the consistency of the solution, i.e., matching the eigenpairs,
among the various eigenvalue problems at the stochastic collocation points. To
this end, a classical eigenvalue tracking technique is proposed that is based
on homotopies between collocation points and a Newton-based eigenvalue solver.
The approach can be efficiently parallelized while tracking the eigenpairs. In
this paper, we propose the application of isogeometric analysis since it allows
for the exact description of the geometrical domains with respect to common
computer-aided design kernels, for a straightforward and convenient way of
handling geometrical variations and smooth solutions.

converge to the fractal energy form. Quasi-unitary equivalence of energy forms

$x_j\in\mathbb{R}$ is $j$-th component of a sample ${\mathbf x}\in

exhibits a Rademacher complexity of $O(\sqrt{\frac{\log p}{m}})$, which is
tight in terms of both $m$ and $p$ in the agnostic case of the classification
problem. In result, we obtain generalization error bounds for finite samples

observation of charge density wave (CDW) with period of approximately 8a in the
halo region surrounding the vortex core, in striking contrast to the
approximately period 4a CDW that are commonly observed in the cuprates.
Inspired by this work, we study a model where a bi-directional pair density
wave (PDW) with period 8 is at play. This further divides into two classes, (1)
where the PDW is a competing state of the d wave superconductor and can exist
only near the vortex core where the d wave order is suppressed, and (2) where
the PDW is the primary order, the so called mother state that persists with
strong phase fluctuations to high temperature and high magnetic field and lies
behind the pseudogap phenomenology. We study the charge density wave structures
near the vortex core in these models. We emphasize the importance of the phase
winding of the d-wave order parameter. The PDW can be pinned by the vortex core
due to this winding and become static. Furthermore, the period 8 CDW inherits
the properties of this winding, which gives rise to a special feature of the
Fourier transform peak, namely, it is split in certain directions. There are
also a line of zeros in the inverse Fourier transform of filtered data. We
propose that these are key experimental signatures that can distinguish between
the PDW-driven scenario from the more mundane option that the period 8 CDW is
primary. We discuss the pros and cons of the options considered above. Finally
we attempt to place the STM experiment in the broader context of pseudogap
physics of underdoped cuprates and relate this observation to the unusual
properties of X ray scattering data on CDW carried out to very high magnetic
field.

properties of low-mass galaxies, with star formation largely ubiquitous amongst
the field population while satellite systems are predominantly quenched. This
dichotomy implies that environmental processes play the dominant role in
suppressing star formation within this low-mass regime (${M}_{\star} \sim
10^{5.5-8}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$). As shown by observations of the Local Volume,
however, there is a non-negligible population of passive systems in the field,
which challenges our understanding of quenching at low masses. By applying the
satellite quenching models of Fillingham et al. (2015) to subhalo populations
in the Exploring the Local Volume In Simulations (ELVIS) suite, we investigate
the role of environmental processes in quenching star formation within the

environmental effects -- of $\sim 0.52 \pm 0.26$ within $1< R/R_{\rm vir} < 2$

of the Local Volume and suggests that the majority of the passive field systems

through an interaction with either the Milky Way or M31, such that more

stars. We compute the first grid of spectral models specially made for stars
stripped in binaries for a range of progenitor masses (2-20$M_{\odot}$) and
metallicities covering a wide range.
  For stripped stars with masses between 0.3-7$M_{\odot}$, we find high
effective temperatures (20-100 kK, increasing with mass), small radii
(0.2-1$R_{\odot}$) and high bolometric luminosities, comparable to that of
their progenitor before stripping. The spectra show a continuous sequence that
naturally bridges subdwarf-type stars and Wolf-Rayet like spectra. For
intermediate masses we find hybrid spectral classes showing a mixture of
absorption and emission lines. These appear for stars with mass loss rates of
$10^{-8}-10^{-6}M_{\odot}$/yr, which have semi-transparent atmospheres. At low
metallicity, substantial H-rich layers are left at the surface and we predict
spectra that resemble O-type stars instead. We obtain spectra undistinguishable
from subdwarfs for stripped stars with masses up to 1.7$M_{\odot}$, which
questions whether the widely adopted canonical value of 0.47$M_{\odot}$ is
uniformly valid.
  Increasing the observed sample of stripped stars will provide necessary tests

investigate the feasibility to detect stripped stars next to an optically
bright companion and recommend searches for their UV excess and possible

evidence of periods of little to no star formation. We use a suite of
cosmological simulations to study how star formation is reignited in such
galaxies. We focus on isolated galaxies at $z=0$ with halo masses between
9.2$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ and 8.4$\times$10$^9$ M$_\odot$, where star
formation is typically shut off by reionization or by supernova feedback.
Nearly 20% of these simulated galaxies later restart star formation, due to
interactions with streams of gas in the intergalactic medium, indicating that
this mechanism is relatively common in this mass range and that many isolated
dwarfs at $z=0$ may not have been isolated throughout their histories. The
source of this gas is not necessarily cosmic filaments. Rather, the dwarfs
interact with gas thrown off by nearby galaxy mergers or streams extending from
neighboring galaxies. While high ram pressure interactions of this nature lead
to stripping, the encounters that reignite star formation are low density
and/or low velocity and thus low ram pressure, resulting in compression of the
hot gas in the halos of our dwarfs. The gas mass bound up in hot halos can be
substantial -- at least an order of magnitude greater than the mass contained
in HI. Consequently, we find that dwarfs that have experienced reignition tend
to be more HI-rich and have a higher M$_{HI}$/M$_{*}$ ratio at $z=0$ than
galaxies with continuous star formation. Using this fact, we identify galaxies
in the Local Volume that might have ""gappy"" star formation histories, and can
be studied by the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope.

that the shortening of H$\beta$ lags depends on accretion rates. The recent
SDSS-RM discovery of shortened H$\beta$ lags in AGNs with low accretion rates
provides compelling evidence for retrograde accretion onto the black hole.
These evidences show that the canonical $R_{\mathrm{H\beta}}$-$L_{5100}$
relation holds only in AGNs with moderate accretion rates. At low accretion
rates, it should be revised to include the effects of black hole spin, whereas

addressing this problem, we study the localized, small scale convective
dynamics of planetary atmospheres by direct numerical simulation of fully
compressible hydrodynamics with reactive tracers using the Dedalus code. Using
polytropically-stratified, plane parallel atmospheres in 2- and 3-D, we explore
the quenching behavior of different abstract chemical species as a function of

necessary to employ length scales based on the chemical equilibrium profile of
the reacting species in order to predict quench points and perform chemical
kinetics modeling in 1-D. Based on the results of our simulations, we provide a
new length scale, derived from the chemical scale height, which can be used to
perform these calculations. This length scale is simple to calculate from known

The accretion of stars from the stellar disc onto the super-massive black hole

pure-feedback-strategy part is zero or the open-loop-control part does not

open-loop equilibrium control and the feedback equilibrium strategy,
respectively. Using a maximum-principle-like methodology with forward-backward
stochastic difference equations, a necessary and sufficient condition is
established to characterize the existence of a mixed equilibrium solution.
Then, by decoupling the forward-backward stochastic difference equations, three
sets of difference equations, which together portray the existence of a mixed
equilibrium solution, are obtained. Moreover, the case with a fixed time-state
initial pair and the case with all the initial pairs are separately
investigated. Furthermore, an example is constructed to show that the mixed

regularization to treat a singular GFF in any dimension, and introduce the
notion of ""$f-$steep point"" of the GFF for certain test function $f$. Roughly
speaking, the $f-$steep points of a generic element of the GFF are locations

the ""rate of change"" of the regularized field element becomes unusually large.
Different choices of $f$ lead to the study of various exceptional behaviors of

$f-$steep points, from which we can recover the existing results on thick point
sets for both log-correlated and polynomial-correlated GFFs, and also obtain

Data poisoning is one of the most relevant security threats against machine

learning has shown that the so-called optimal attack strategies can
successfully poison linear classifiers, degrading the performance of the system

in certain non-collinear antiferromagnets also imply both non-zero orbital
magnetization and a net spin magnetization. We have explicitly evaluated the
orbital magnetizations of several anomalous Hall effect antiferromagnets and
find that they tend to dominate over spin magnetizations, especially so when
spin-orbit interactions are weak. Because of the greater relative importance of
orbital magnetization the coupling between magnetic order and an external
magnetic field is unusual. We explain how magnetic fields can be used to
manipulate magnetic configurations in these systems, pointing in particular to
the important role played by the response of orbital magnetization to the
Zeeman-like spin exchange fields.

MapReduce routinely process data that are on the orders of petabytes or more.
The sheer size of the data precludes the processing of the data on a single
computer. The philosophy in these methods is to partition the overall job into
smaller tasks that are executed on different servers; this is called the map
phase. This is followed by a data shuffling phase where appropriate data is
exchanged between the servers. The final so-called reduce phase, completes the
computation.
  One potential approach, explored in prior work for reducing the overall
execution time is to operate on a natural tradeoff between computation and
communication. Specifically, the idea is to run redundant copies of map tasks
that are placed on judiciously chosen servers. The shuffle phase exploits the
location of the nodes and utilizes coded transmission. The main drawback of
this approach is that it requires the original job to be split into a number of
map tasks that grows exponentially in the system parameters. This is
problematic, as we demonstrate that splitting jobs too finely can in fact
adversely affect the overall execution time.
  In this work we show that one can simultaneously obtain low communication
loads while ensuring that jobs do not need to be split too finely. Our approach
uncovers a deep relationship between this problem and a class of combinatorial
structures called resolvable designs. Appropriate interpretation of resolvable
designs can allow for the development of coded distributed computing schemes
where the splitting levels are exponentially lower than prior work. We present
experimental results obtained on Amazon EC2 clusters for a widely known
distributed algorithm, namely TeraSort. We obtain over 4.69$\times$ improvement
in speedup over the baseline approach and more than 2.6$\times$ over current
state of the art.

is washed out by the electroweak sphalerons. Here, we point out that helical
hypermagnetic fields can be generated through the chiral magnetic effect with a
chiral asymmetry generated in such baryogenesis models. The helical
hypermagnetic fields then produce baryon asymmetry mainly at the electroweak
symmetry breaking, which remains until today. Therefore, the baryogenesis
models without $B$-$L$ asymmetry can still be the origin of the present baryon
asymmetry. In particular, if it can produce chiral asymmetry mainly carried by
right-handed electrons of order of $10^{-3}$ in terms of the chemical potential
to temperature ratio, the resultant present-day baryon asymmetry can be
consistent with our Universe, although simple realizations of the GUT
baryogenesis are hard to satisfy the condition. We also argue the way to
overcome the difficulty in the GUT baryogenesis. The intergalactic magnetic
fields with $B_0\sim 10^{-16 \sim 17}$ G and $\lambda_0 \sim 10^{-2\sim3}$ pc

fourth-order moments of the received signal, which are employed to estimate the
normalized squared autocorrelation function of the fading channel. Then, the
problem of MDS estimation is formulated as a non-linear regression problem, and
the least-squares curvefitting optimization technique is applied to determine
the estimate of the MDS. This is the first time in the literature when DAand
NDA-MDS estimation is investigated for MIMO frequency-selective fading channel.
Simulation results show that there is no significant performance gap between
the derived NDA-MLE and NDA-CRLB even when the observation window is relatively

low root-mean-square error (NRMSE) over a wide range of MDSs when the

proposed iterative AMV approach, which is later proved to coincide with the
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator. We then propose a series of power-based
iterative SAMV approaches, which are robust against insufficient snapshots,
coherent sources and arbitrary array geometries. Moreover, to overcome the
direction grid limitation on the estimation accuracy, the SAMV-Stochastic ML
(SAMV-SML) approaches are derived by explicitly minimizing a closed form
stochastic ML cost function with respect to one scalar parameter, eliminating
the need of any additional grid refinement techniques. To assist the
performance evaluation, approximate solutions to the SAMV approaches are also
provided at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low SNR, respectively.
Finally, numerical examples are generated to compare the performance of the

outperforms statistical downscalers that use either AOD or CMAQ in

employed in the current depth-based 3D video systems by synthesizing a virtual
view from an arbitrary viewpoint. However, holes may appear in the synthesized
view due to disocclusion, thus significantly degrading the quality.
Consequently, efforts have been made on developing effective and efficient hole
filling algorithms. Current hole filling techniques generally
extrapolate/interpolate the hole regions with the neighboring information based
on an assumption that the texture pattern in the holes is similar to that of
the neighboring background information. However, in many scenarios especially
of complex texture, the assumption may not hold. In other words, hole filling
techniques can only provide an estimation for a hole which may not be good
enough or may even be erroneous considering a wide variety of complex scene of
images. In this paper, we first examine the view interpolation with multiple
reference views, demonstrating that the problem of emerging holes in a target
virtual view can be greatly alleviated by making good use of other neighboring
complementary views in addition to its two (commonly used) most neighboring
primary views. The effects of using multiple views for view extrapolation in
reducing holes are also investigated in this paper. In view of the 3D Video and
ongoing free-viewpoint TV standardization, we propose a new view synthesis
framework which employs multiple views to synthesize output virtual views.
Furthermore, a scheme of selective warping of complementary views is developed
by efficiently locating a small number of useful pixels in the complementary
views for hole reduction, to avoid a full warping of additional complementary
views thus lowering greatly the warping complexity.

derive the Foldy-Lax approximation of the scattered fields generated by a
cluster of small conductive inhomogeneities arbitrarily distributed in a
bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  This approximation is valid under a sufficient but general condition on the
number of such inhomogeneities $m$, their maximum radii $\epsilon$ and the
minimum distances between them $\delta$, the form $$(\ln
m)^{\frac{1}{3}}\frac{\epsilon}{\delta} \leq C,$$ where $C$ is a constant
depending only on the Lipschitz characters of the scaled inhomogeneities. In
addition, we provide explicit error estimates of this approximation in terms of
aforementioned parameters, $m, \epsilon, \delta$ but also the used frequencies
$k$ under the Rayleigh regime. Both the far-fields and the near-fields (stated
at a distance $\delta$ to the cluster) are estimated. In particular, for a
moderate number of small inhomogeneities $m$, the derived expansions are valid
in the mesoscale regime where $\delta \sim \epsilon$.
  At the mathematical analysis level and based on integral equation methods, we
prove a priori estimates of the densities in the $L^{2,Div}_t$ spaces instead
of the usual $L^2$ spaces (which are not enough). A key point in such a proof
is a derivation of a particular Helmholtz type decomposition of the densities.
Those estimates allow to obtain the needed qualitative as well as quantitative
estimates while refining the approximation. Finally, to prove the invertibility
of the Foldy-Lax linear algebraic system, we reduce the coercivity inequality
to the one related to the scalar Helmholtz model. As this linear algebraic
system comes from the boundary conditions, such a reduction is not
straightforward.

impact on the study of fast radio transients, where a few milliseconds of data
is enough to pinpoint a source at cosmological distances. However, recording
interferometric data at millisecond cadence produces a terabyte-per-hour data
stream that strains networks, computing systems, and archives. This challenge
mirrors that of other domains of science, where the science scope is limited by
the computational architecture as much as the physical processes at play. Here,
we present a solution to this problem in the context of radio transients:
realfast, a commensal, fast transient search system at the Jansky Very Large
Array. Realfast uses a novel architecture to distribute fast-sampled
interferometric data to a 32-node, 64-GPU cluster for real-time imaging and
transient detection. By detecting transients in situ, we can trigger the
recording of data for those rare, brief instants when the event occurs and
reduce the recorded data volume by a factor of 1000. This makes it possible to
commensally search a data stream that would otherwise be impossible to record.
This system will search for millisecond transients in more than 1000 hours of
data per year, potentially localizing several Fast Radio Bursts, pulsars, and
other sources of impulsive radio emission. We describe the science scope for
realfast, the system design, expected outcomes, and ways real-time analysis can

consensus on the order parameter exists and the nature has posed a
long-standing mystery. Here we report the discovery of a Griffiths phase within
the hidden-order phase, characterized by residual short-range correlations on
the collapse of long-range orders due to the dilution effects. In the Griffiths
phase scenario, strong evidence are provided for those cluster-like spins, such
as the unique power-law behavior of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat
as well as the frequency dispersion of AC susceptibility. In this way, the
existence of an order parameter is excluded, and the hidden order has a
significant kinship with the long-range large-moment antiferromagnetism which
is accessible by tuning the hydrostatic pressure or the chemical pressure
(i.e., isoelectronic Fe doping). Moreover, an unidirectional anisotropy of
resistivity measurements in rotating magnetic fields is observed in the
hidden-order phase. The anisotropic magnetoresistance and the associated broken
symmetries directly reflect the freezing behavior of at least part of magnetic
clusters. Thus, the demonstrations of the Griffiths phase as an alternative
proposal for the hidden-order phase of URu2Si2 are very promising, challenging

methods applied in dental imaging. Ten segmentation methods were studied and
categorized according to the type of the segmentation method (region-based,
threshold-based, cluster-based, boundary-based or watershed-based), type of
X-ray images used (intra-oral or extra-oral) and characteristics of the dataset
used to evaluate the methods in the state-of-the-art works. We found that the
literature has primarily focused on threshold-based segmentation methods (54%).
80% of the reviewed papers have used intra-oral X-ray images in their
experiments, demonstrating preference to perform segmentation on images of
already isolated parts of the teeth, rather than using extra-oral X-rays, which
show tooth structure of the mouth and bones of the face. To fill a scientific
gap in the field, a novel data set based on extra-oral X-ray images are
proposed here. A statistical comparison of the results found with the 10 image
segmentation methods over our proposed data set comprised of 1,500 images is
also carried out, providing a more comprehensive source of performance
assessment. Discussion on limitations of the methods conceived over the past
year as well as future perspectives on exploiting learning-based segmentation
methods to improve performance are also provided.

investigated over the years, together with some notable non-linear limits.
Although in these models the gravitino becomes naturally massive absorbing the
degrees of freedom of a Nambu-Goldstone fermion, there are cases in which the
naive counting of degrees of freedom does not apply, in particular because of
the absence of explicit gravitino mass terms in unitary gauge. The
corresponding models require non-trivial de Sitter-like backgrounds, and it
becomes of interest to clarify the fate of their Nambu-Goldstone modes. We
elaborate on the fact that these non-trivial backgrounds can accommodate,
consistently, gravitino fields carrying a number of degrees of freedom that is
intermediate between those of massless and massive fields in a flat spacetime.
For instance, in a simple supergravity model of this type with de Sitter
background, the overall degrees of freedom of gravitino are as many as for a
massive spin-3/2 field in flat spacetime, while the gravitino remains massless
in the sense that it undergoes null-cone propagation in the stereographic
picture. On the other hand, in the ten-dimensional USp(32) Type I Sugimoto
model with ""brane SUSY breaking"", which requires a more complicated background,
the degrees of freedom of gravitino are half as many of those of a massive one,
and yet it somehow behaves again as a massless one.

view of the biological background of this system and of its mass conservation
property, blowup is usually interpreted as a phenomenon of concentration or
aggregation of the bacterial population. Understanding the asymptotic behavior
of solutions at the blowup time is thus meaningful for the interpretation of
the model.
  Under mild assumptions on the initial data, for $n\ge 3$, we show that the
final profile satisfies $C_1|x|^{-2}\le u(x,T)\le C_2|x|^{-2}$, with
convergence in $L^1$ as $t\to T$. This is in sharp contrast with the
two-dimensional case, where solutions are known to concentrate to a Dirac mass
at the origin (plus an integrable part). We also obtain refined space-time
estimates of the form $u(x,t)\le C(T-t+|x|^2)^{-1}$ for type~I blowup
solutions. Previous work had shown that radial, self-similar blowup solutions
(which satisfy the above estimates) exist in dimensions $n\ge 3$ and do not
exist in dimension $2$. Our results thus reveal that the final profile
displayed by these special solutions actually corresponds to a much more

driven by a slowly varying external field. Our interest is in an automaton
description (AQS-A) that represents the AQS dynamics in terms of the graph of
state transitions triggered by the driving field. A particular feature of these
systems is return point memory (RPM), a tendency for the system to return to
the same microstate upon cycling the field. It is known that the existence of
three conditions, (1) a partial order on the set of configuration; (2) a
no-passing property; and (3) an adiabatic response to monotonous driving
fields, implies RPM. When periodically driven, such systems settle into a
cyclic response after a transient of at most one period. However conditions
(1)-(3) are only sufficient but not necessary. In fact, we show that the AQS
dynamics naturally provides a more selective partial order which, due to its
connection to hysteresis loops, is a natural choice for establishing RPM. This
enables us to consider AQS-A exhibiting RPM without necessarily possessing the
no-passing property. We call such automata $\ell$AQS-A and work out the
structure of their state transition graphs. Our central finding is that RPM
constrains the {\em intra-loop} structure of hysteresis loops, namely its
hierarchical organization into sub loops, but not the {\em inter-loop}
structure. We prove that the topology of the intra-loop structure has a natural
representation in terms of an ordered tree and that the corresponding state
transition graph is planar. On the other hand, the RPM property does not
significantly restrict inter-loop transitions. A system exhibiting RPM and
subject to periodic forcing can thus undergo a large number of transient cycles
before settling into a periodic response. Such systems can even exhibit
subharmonic response.

Radio Galaxies have emerged as a highly instructive source class providing
unique insights into high energy acceleration and radiation mechanisms.
Aims.Here we aim at a detailed characterization of the high-energy (HE;>100
MeV) gamma-ray emission from the prominent radio galaxy M87. Methods.We analyze
8 years of Fermi-LAT data and derive the spectral energy distribution between
100 MeV and 300 GeV. We extract lightcurves and investigate the variability
behaviour for the entire energy range as well as below and above 10 GeV.
Results.Our analysis provides (i)evidence for HE gamma-ray flux variability and
(ii)indications for a possible excess over the standard power-law model above
Eb~10 GeV, similar to the earlier indications in the case of Cen A. When viewed
in HE-VHE context, this is most naturally explained by an additional component
dominating the highest-energy part of the spectrum. Investigation of the
gamma-ray lightcurves suggests that the lower-energy (<10 GeV) component is
variable on timescales of (at least) a few months. The statistics of the high
energy component (>10 GeV) does not allow significant constraints on
variability. We find indications, however, for spectral changes with time that
support variability of the putative additional component and seem to favor
jet-related scenarios for its origin capable of accommodating month-type
variability. Conclusions.The current findings suggest that both the high-energy
(> Eb) and the very high energy (VHE;>100 GeV) emission in M87 are compatible
with originating from the same physical component. The variability behaviour at
VHE then allows further constraints on the location and the nature of the
second component. In particular, these considerations suggest that the VHE
emission during the quiescent state originates in a similar region as during
the flare.

this paper, we introduce the notion of $N$-expansiveness for flows on a
$C^{\infty}$ compact connected Riemannian manifold by using the kinematic
expansiveness which is extension of the $N$-expansive diffeomorphisms. And we
prove that a vector field $X$ on $M$ is $C^1$ robustly kinematic $N$-expansive
then $X$ satisfies quasi-Anosov. Furthermore, we consider the hyperbolicity of
local dynamical systems with kinematic $N$-expansiveness.

powerful tools for structure searches and material discovery. However, they are
generally restricted to small systems owing to the heavy computational cost of
underlying density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In this work, by
combining state-of-art machine learning (ML) potential with our in-house
developed CALYPSO structure prediction method, we developed two acceleration
schemes for structure prediction toward large systems, in which ML potential is
pre-constructed to fully replace DFT calculations or trained in an on-the-fly
manner from scratch during the structure searches. The developed schemes have
been applied to medium- and large-sized boron clusters, which are challenging
cases for both construction of ML potentials and extensive structure searches.
Experimental structures of B36 and B40 clusters can be readily reproduced, and
the putative global minimum structure for B84 cluster is proposed, where
substantially less computational cost by several orders of magnitude is evident
if compared with full DFT-based structure searches. Our results demonstrate a
viable route for structure prediction toward large systems via the combination

have attracted the attention of many researchers. Of particular interest, is
that of bounding the zero forcing number from above. In this paper we show a

that if $G \ne K_4$ is a connected, cubic, claw-free graph, then $Z(G) \le

known lower bounds on $\alpha(G)$. As a consequence of this result, if $G \ne

near the X points, which, according to the topological theory, could give rise
to nontrivial band topology with odd number of gapless topological surface

gapless topological surface state is observed due to its strong hybridization
with the bulk bands. Near the M bar point, the two surface states, due to
projections from two inequivalent bulk band inversions, interact and give rise
to two peculiar sets of gapped surface states. The bulk band inversions and
corresponding surface states can be tuned substantially by varying rare earth

extensively debated over the last decade. The regime of greatest uncertainty is
in the most actively star-forming galaxies, where large dust columns can
potentially produce a dust-reprocessed infrared radiation field with enough
pressure to drive turbulence or eject material. Here we derive the conditions
under which a self-gravitating, mixed gas-star disc can remain hydrostatic
despite trapped radiation pressure. Consistently taking into account the
self-gravity of the medium, the star- and dust-to-gas ratios, and the effects
of turbulent motions not driven by radiation, we show that galaxies can achieve
a maximum Eddington-limited star formation rate per unit area
$\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm *,crit} \sim 10^3 M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$,
corresponding to a critical flux of $F_{\rm *,crit} \sim 10^{13} L_{\odot}$
kpc$^{-2}$ similar to previous estimates; higher fluxes eject mass in bulk,
halting further star formation. Conversely, we show that in galaxies below this
limit, our one-dimensional models imply simple vertical hydrostatic equilibrium
and that radiation pressure is ineffective at driving turbulence or ejecting
matter. Because the vast majority of star-forming galaxies lie below the
maximum limit for typical dust-to-gas ratios, we conclude that infrared
radiation pressure is likely unimportant for all but the most extreme systems
on galaxy-wide scales. Thus, while radiation pressure does not explain the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, it does impose an upper truncation on it. Our
predicted truncation is in good agreement with the highest observed gas and
star formation rate surface densities found both locally and at high redshift.

planet formation theory. In particular, rocky planetesimal formation is
difficult because silicate dust grains are easily broken when they collide.
Recently, it has been proposed that they can grow as porous aggregates when
their monomer radius is smaller than $\sim$ 10 nm, which can also avoid the
radial drift toward the central star. However, the stability of a layer
composed of such porous silicate dust aggregates has not been investigated.
Therefore, we investigate the gravitational instability of this dust layer. To
evaluate the disk stability, we calculate Toomre's stability parameter $Q$, for
which we need to evaluate the equilibrium random velocity of dust aggregates.
We calculate the equilibrium random velocity considering gravitational
scattering and collisions between dust aggregates, drag by mean flow of gas,
stirring by gas turbulence, and gravitational scattering by gas density
fluctuation due to turbulence. We derive the condition of the gravitational
instability using the disk mass, dust-to-gas ratio, turbulent strength, orbital
radius, and dust monomer radius. We find that, for the minimum mass solar
nebula model at 1 au, the dust layer becomes gravitationally unstable when the
turbulent strength $\alpha\lesssim10^{-5}$. If the dust-to-gas ratio is
increased twice, the gravitational instability occurs for
$\alpha\lesssim10^{-4}$. We also find that the dust layer is more unstable in
disks with larger mass, higher dust-to-gas ratio, and weaker turbulent
strength, at larger orbital radius, and with a larger monomer radius.

problem with communication delays for a class of cyber-physical systems (CPSs).
The raw measurements are preprocessed in each sink node to obtain the local
optimal estimate (LOE) of a CPS, and the compressed LOE under dimensionality
reduction encounters with communication delays during the transmission. Under
this case, a mathematical model with compensation strategy is proposed to
characterize the dimensionality reduction and communication delays. This model
also has the property to reduce the information loss caused by the
dimensionality reduction and delays. Based on this model, a recursive
distributed Kalman fusion estimator (DKFE) is derived by optimal weighted
fusion criterion in the linear minimum variance sense. A stability condition
for the DKFE, which can be easily verified by the exiting software, is derived.
In addition, this condition can guarantee that estimation error covariance
matrix of the DKFE converges to the unique steady-state matrix for any initial
values, and thus the steady-state DKFE (SDKFE) is given. Notice that the
computational complexity of the SDKFE is much lower than that of the DKFE.
Moreover, a probability selection criterion for determining the dimensionality
reduction strategy is also presented to guarantee the stability of the DKFE.
Two illustrative examples are given to show the advantage and effectiveness of
the proposed methods.

paper, we extend the robust and sparse linear regression based on the

a stochastic optimization approach and extend the established convergence
property to the classical first-order necessary condition. By virtue of the

very large problems. Particularly, we show the linear regression, logistic

micro-batch (e.g., less than 10 samples in a mini-batch), since the estimated
statistics in a mini-batch are not reliable with insufficient samples. In this
paper, we present a novel normalization method, called Batch Kalman
Normalization (BKN), for improving and accelerating the training of DNNs,
particularly under the context of micro-batches. Specifically, unlike the
existing solutions treating each hidden layer as an isolated system, BKN treats
all the layers in a network as a whole system, and estimates the statistics of
a certain layer by considering the distributions of all its preceding layers,
mimicking the merits of Kalman Filtering. BKN has two appealing properties.
First, it enables more stable training and faster convergence compared to
previous works. Second, training DNNs using BKN performs substantially better
than those using BN and its variants, especially when very small mini-batches
are presented. On the image classification benchmark of ImageNet, using BKN
powered networks we improve upon the best-published model-zoo results: reaching
74.0% top-1 val accuracy for InceptionV2. More importantly, using BKN achieves
the comparable accuracy with extremely smaller batch size, such as 64 times

examine the relationship between growth and locations of craft breweries and
the incidence of neighborhood change across the United States. In the first
part of the chapter, we rely on a unique dataset of geocoded brewery locations
that tracks openings and closings from 2004 to the present. Using measures of
neighborhood change often found in literature on gentrification-related topics,
we develop statistical models relying on census tract demographic and
employment data to determine the extent to which brewery locations are
associated with social and demographic shifts since 2000. The strongest
predictor of whether a craft brewery opened in 2013 or later in a neighborhood
was the presence of a prior brewery. We do not find evidence entirely
consistent with the common narrative of a link between gentrification and craft
brewing, but we see a link between an influx of lower-to-middle income urban
creatives and the introduction of a craft breweries. We advocate for urban
planners to recognize the importance of craft breweries in neighborhood
revitalization while also protecting residents from potential displacement.

  The He-like triplets of Mg and Si are resolved into individual lines, and the

modelled with a photoionization model, and the results are compared with that
of a collisional model. Through a detailed analysis on the spectrum, we exclude
a collisional origin for these emission lines. A one-component photoionization
model provides a great fit to the emission features.
  The best-fit parameters are log$\xi$ = $3.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ erg cm s$^{-1}$,
$n_{H}$ = $5^{+15}_{-4.5}\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N_{H}$ =

According to the existing studies, the high upfront cost is among the most
critical challenges associated with private clouds. To reduce cost and improve
performance, virtual machine placement (VMP) methods have been extensively
investigated, however, few of these methods have focused on private clouds.
This paper proposes a heterogeneous and multidimensional clairvoyant dynamic

processes using additional information on the arrival time and duration of
virtual machines to reduce the datacenter scale and thereby decrease the
upfront cost of private clouds. In addition, a novel branch-and-bound algorithm

experiments are conducted on both real-world and synthetic workloads to
evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms. The experimental
results demonstrate that DCBB delivers near-optimal solutions with a
convergence rate that is much faster than those of the other search-based

separation. Classical source models in the short-term Fourier transform domain
use circularly-symmetric Gaussian or Poisson random variables. This is
equivalent to assuming that the phase of each source is uniformly distributed,
which is not suitable for exploiting the underlying structure of the phase.
Drawing on preliminary works, we introduce here a Bayesian anisotropic Gaussian
source model in which the phase is no longer uniform. Such a model permits us
to favor a phase value that originates from a signal model through a Markov
chain prior structure. The variance of the latent variables are structured with
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The resulting model is called complex
Itakura-Saito NMF (ISNMF) since it generalizes the ISNMF model to the case of
non-isotropic variables. It combines the advantages of ISNMF, which uses a
distortion measure adapted to audio and yields a set of estimates which
preserve the overall energy of the mixture, and of complex NMF, which enables
one to account for some phase constraints. We derive a generalized
expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters.
Experiments conducted on a musical source separation task in a semi-informed
setting show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art
phase-aware separation techniques.

(distributed and dynamic). We represent applications as semantically described
data flows that are run decentrally on participating devices, and connected at
runtime via rules. This allows integrating new devices into applications
without manual interaction and removes central controllers from the equation.
This approach provides similar features to current automation systems (central
engineering, multiple instantiation of applications), but enables distributed
and dynamic operation. We demonstrate satisfying performance of the system via
a quantitative evaluation.

"1802.03160","Michal Dory","Keren Censor-Hillel, Michal Dory","Distributed Spanner Approximation",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the fundamental network design problem of constructing approximate
minimum spanners. Our contributions are for the distributed setting, providing
both algorithmic and hardness results.
  Our main hardness result shows that an $\alpha$-approximation for the minimum
directed $k$-spanner problem for $k \geq 5$ requires $\Omega(n
/\sqrt{\alpha}\log{n})$ rounds using deterministic algorithms or
$\Omega(\sqrt{n }/\sqrt{\alpha}\log{n})$ rounds using randomized ones, in the
CONGEST model of distributed computing. Combined with the constant-round
$O(n^{\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm in the LOCAL model of [Barenboim,
Elkin and Gavoille, 2016], as well as a polylog-round
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm in the LOCAL model that we show here,
our lower bounds for the CONGEST model imply a strict separation between the
LOCAL and CONGEST models. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first separation between these models for a local approximation problem.
  Similarly, a separation between the directed and undirected cases is implied.
We also prove a nearly-linear lower bound for the minimum weighted $k$-spanner
problem for $k \geq 4$, and we show lower bounds for the weighted 2-spanner
problem.
  On the algorithmic side, apart from the aforementioned
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for minimum $k$-spanners, our main
contribution is a new distributed construction of minimum 2-spanners that uses
only polynomial local computations. Our algorithm has a guaranteed
approximation ratio of $O(\log(m/n))$ for a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$
edges, which matches the best known ratio for polynomial time sequential
algorithms [Kortsarz and Peleg, 1994], and is tight if we restrict ourselves to
polynomial local computations. Our approach allows us to extend our algorithm
to work also for the directed, weighted, and client-server variants of the
problem.

  URL Detection",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Malicious URLs host unsolicited content and are used to perpetrate
cybercrimes. It is imperative to detect them in a timely manner. Traditionally,
this is done through the usage of blacklists, which cannot be exhaustive, and
cannot detect newly generated malicious URLs. To address this, recent years
have witnessed several efforts to perform Malicious URL Detection using Machine
Learning. The most popular and scalable approaches use lexical properties of
the URL string by extracting Bag-of-words like features, followed by applying
machine learning models such as SVMs. There are also other features designed by
experts to improve the prediction performance of the model. These approaches
suffer from several limitations: (i) Inability to effectively capture semantic
meaning and sequential patterns in URL strings; (ii) Requiring substantial
manual feature engineering; and (iii) Inability to handle unseen features and
generalize to test data. To address these challenges, we propose URLNet, an
end-to-end deep learning framework to learn a nonlinear URL embedding for
Malicious URL Detection directly from the URL. Specifically, we apply
Convolutional Neural Networks to both characters and words of the URL String to
learn the URL embedding in a jointly optimized framework. This approach allows
the model to capture several types of semantic information, which was not
possible by the existing models. We also propose advanced word-embeddings to
solve the problem of too many rare words observed in this task. We conduct
extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset and show a significant
performance gain over existing methods. We also conduct ablation studies to
evaluate the performance of various components of URLNet.

functions and metric forms for metric learning problem. These improvements have
shown promising results when the test data is similar to the training data.
However, the trained models often fail to produce reliable distances on the
ambiguous test pairs due to the distribution bias between training set and test
set. To address this problem, the Adversarial Metric Learning (AML) is proposed
in this paper, which automatically generates adversarial pairs to remedy the
distribution bias and facilitate robust metric learning. Specifically, AML
consists of two adversarial stages, i.e. confusion and distinguishment. In
confusion stage, the ambiguous but critical adversarial data pairs are
adaptively generated to mislead the learned metric. In distinguishment stage, a
metric is exhaustively learned to try its best to distinguish both the
adversarial pairs and the original training pairs. Thanks to the challenges
posed by the confusion stage in such competing process, the AML model is able
to grasp plentiful difficult knowledge that has not been contained by the
original training pairs, so the discriminability of AML can be significantly
improved. The entire model is formulated into optimization framework, of which
the global convergence is theoretically proved. The experimental results on toy
data and practical datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of AML to the
representative state-of-the-art metric learning methodologies.

interaction $U$. This chiral phase is stabilized in the Mott phase with one
particle per site in the presence of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette, and in
the Mott phase with two particles per site without any flux. Our approach
relies on effective spin models derived in the strong-coupling limit in powers
of $t/U$ for general SU$(N)$ and arbitrary uniform charge flux per plaquette,
which are subsequently studied using exact diagonalizations and variational
Monte Carlo simulations for $N=3$, as well as exact diagonalizations of the
SU($3$) Hubbard model on small clusters. Up to third order in $t/U$, and for
the time-reversal symmetric cases (flux $0$ or $\pi$), the low-energy

ring exchange $K$. The phase diagram in the full $J$-$K$ parameter range
contains, apart from three already known, magnetically long-range ordered
phases, two previously unreported phases: i) a lattice nematic phase breaking
the lattice rotation symmetry and ii) a spontaneous time-reversal and parity
symmetry breaking Abelian chiral spin liquid. For the Hubbard model, an
investigation that includes higher-order itinerancy effects supports the
presence of a phase transition inside the insulating region, occurring at
$(t/U)_{\rm c}\approx 0.07$ [$(U/t)_{\rm c} \approx 13$] between the

successfully apply our method to two well-observed coronal dimming events. For
both events the core dimming regions are identified and the spatial evolution

expansion the total unsigned magnetic flux involved in the dimming regions is
balanced and that up to 30% of this flux results from the localized core
dimming regions. Furthermore, the onset in the profile of the area growth rate

over a toric lattice network, and study asymptotic scalings (in network size)
of H2 performance metrics that quantify the variance of nodal state
fluctuations. While previous studies have shown that distributed integral
control fundamentally improves these performance scalings compared to
distributed proportional feedback control, our results show that an explicit
inclusion of measurement noise leads to the opposite conclusion. The noise's
impact on performance is shown to decrease with an increased inter-nodal
alignment of the local integral states. However, even though the controller can
be tuned for acceptable performance for any given network size, performance
will degrade as the network grows, limiting the scalability of any such
controller tuning. In particular, the requirement for inter-nodal alignment
increases with network size. We show that this in practice implies that large
and sparse networks will require any integral control to be centralized, rather
than distributed. In this case, the best-achievable performance scaling, which
is shown to be that of proportional feedback control, is retrieved.

diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of cosmic-ray (CR) protons at weak
collisionless shocks that are expected to form in the intracluster medium. As
an effort to address this problem, we here explore possible roles of Alfv\'en
waves self-excited via resonant streaming instability during the CR
acceleration at parallel shocks. The mean drift of Alfv\'en waves may either
increase or decrease the scattering center compression ratio, depending on the
postshock cross-helicity, leading to either flatter or steeper CR spectra. We
first examine such effects at planar shocks, based on the transport of Alfv\'en
waves in the small amplitude limit. For the shock parameters relevant to
cluster shocks, Alfv\'enic drift flattens the CR spectrum slightly, resulting
in a small increase of the CR acceleration efficiency, $\eta$. We then consider
two additional, physically motivated cases: (1) postshock waves are isotropized
via MHD and plasma processes across the shock transition and (2) postshock
waves contain only forward waves propagating along with the flow due to a
possible gradient of CR pressure behind the shock. In these cases, Alfv\'enic
drift could reduce $\eta$ by as much as a factor of 5 for weak cluster shocks.
For the canonical parameters adopted here, we suggest $\eta\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$
for shocks with sonic Mach number $M_{\rm s}\approx2-3$. The possible reduction
of $\eta$ may help ease the tension between non-detection of $\gamma$-rays from
galaxy clusters and DSA predictions.

processes divide into two natural classes: those that can be expressed as
convex mixture of elementary trajectories and those that cannot be. The former
are shown to be entanglement breaking processes (in each step), while the
latter are dubbed coherent processes. This division of processes is analogous
to separable and entangled states. In the second half of the paper, we show,
with an information theoretic game, that when a process is non-Markovian,
coherent trajectories allow for decoupling from the environment while
preserving arbitrary quantum information encoded into the system. We give
explicit expressions for the temporal correlations (quantifying
non-Markovianity) and show that, in general, there are more quantum
correlations than classical ones. This shows that non-Markovian quantum
processes are indeed fundamentally different from their classical counterparts.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how coherent trajectories (with the aid of coherent
control) could turn non-Markovianity into a resource. In the final section of
the paper we explore this phenomenon in a geometric picture with a convenient

dependence on the microwave detuning, the atomic signal after the Ramsey
interrogation acquires a dependence on the microwave pulse area (amplitude
times duration) that can be exploited to implement an active stabilization of
the microwave field amplitude, in a similar way in which the Ramsey clock
signal is used to lock the local oscillator frequency to the atomic reference.
This stabilization results in a reduced sensitivity of the clock frequency to
microwave amplitude fluctuations that are transferred to the atoms through the
cavity-pulling effect. The proposed technique is then effective to improve the
clock stability and drift on medium and long term. We demonstrate the method

  brute-force and dictionary attacks",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces Freestyle, a randomized and variable round version of
the ChaCha cipher. Freestyle uses the concept of hash based halting condition
where a decryption attempt with an incorrect key is likely to take longer time
to halt. This makes Freestyle resistant to key-guessing attacks i.e.
brute-force and dictionary based attacks. Freestyle demonstrates a novel
approach for ciphertext randomization by using random number of rounds for each
block, where the exact number of rounds are unknown to the receiver in advance.
Freestyle provides the possibility of generating $2^{128}$ different
ciphertexts for a given key, nonce, and message; thus resisting key and nonce
reuse attacks. Due to its inherent random behavior, Freestyle makes
cryptanalysis through known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext, and chosen-ciphertext
attacks difficult in practice. On the other hand, Freestyle has costlier cipher
initialization process, typically generates 3.125% larger ciphertext, and was
found to be 1.6 to 3.2 times slower than ChaCha20. Freestyle is suitable for
applications that favor ciphertext randomization and resistance to key-guessing
and key reuse attacks over performance and ciphertext size. Freestyle is ideal
for applications where ciphertext can be assumed to be in full control of an
adversary, and an offline key-guessing attack can be carried out.

investigate QED processes occurring in the presence of an intense plane-wave

relatively simple proofs of the completeness and of the orthonormality at a

whereas the orthonormality of the Volkov states is proved, relying only on a
geometric argument based on the Gauss theorem in four dimensions. In relation
with the completeness of the Volkov states, we also study some analytical
properties of the Green's function of the Dirac operator in a plane wave, which
we explicitly prove to coincide with the Volkov propagator in configuration
space. In particular, a closed-form expression in terms of modified Bessel
functions and Hankel functions is derived by means of the operator technique in
a plane wave and different asymptotic forms are determined. Finally, the
transformation properties of the Volkov propagator under general gauge
transformations and a general gauge-invariant expression of the so-called

can be expressed as a linear combination of the periods of $A$ with real

algebraic family, these coordinates define a system of multivalued
real-analytic functions. Computing its rank (in the sense of differential
geometry) becomes important when one is interested about how often $\xi$ takes
a torsion value (for instance, Manin's theorem of the kernel implies that this
coordinate system is constant in a family without fixed part only when $\xi$ is
a torsion section).
  We compute this rank in terms of the rank of a certain contracted form of the
Kodaira-Spencer map associated to $(A, \xi)$ (assuming $A$ without fixed part,
and $\mathbb{Z} \xi$ Zariski-dense in $A$), and deduce some explicit lower
bounds in special situations. For instance, we determine this rank in relative

hyperelliptic curves.
  Our main application, obtained in collaboration with Z. Gao, states that if
$A\to S$ is a principally polarized abelian scheme of relative dimension $g$
which has no non-trivial endomorphism (on any finite covering), and if the
image of $S$ in the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ has dimension at least $g$,
then the Betti map of any non-torsion section $\xi$ is generically a
submersion, so that $\xi^{-1}A_{tors}$ is dense in $S(\mathbb{C})$.

that thermal protons experience a notably higher barrier than deuterons when
entering van der Waals gaps in hexagonal boron nitride and molybdenum

isotopes. Once inside the crystals, transport of both isotopes can be described
by classical diffusion, albeit with unexpectedly fast rates, comparable to that

technique for manipulation of non-laser-coolable ions

vastly enhanced spectroscopic resolution and accuracy. However, this potential
remains untapped so far, with the best resolution achieved being not better
than $5\times10^{-8}$ fractionally, due to residual Doppler broadening being
present in ion clusters even at the lowest achievable translational
temperatures (Bressel2012). Here we introduce a general and accessible approach
that enables Doppler-free rotational spectroscopy. It makes use of the strong
radial spatial confinement of molecular ions when trapped and crystallized in a
linear quadrupole trap, providing the Lamb-Dicke regime for rotational
transitions. We achieve a line width of $1\times10^{-9}$ fractionally and
$1.3~\textrm{kHz}$ absolute, an improvement by $50$ and nearly $3\times10^{3}$,
respectively, over other methods. The systematic uncertainty is
$2.5\times10^{-10}$. As an application, we demonstrate the most precise test of
$\textit{ab initio}$ molecular theory and the most precise ($1.3~\textrm{PPB}$)
spectroscopic determination of the proton mass. The results represent the long

the analysis of hierarchical data such as, for instance, longitudinal data with
the use of recurrent neural networks. In the other hand, cohort studies have
become a tool of importance in the research field of epidemiology. In such
studies, variables are measured repeatedly over time, to allow the practitioner
to study their temporal evolution as trajectories, and, as such, as
longitudinal data. This paper investigates the application of the advanced
modelling techniques provided by the deep learning framework in the analysis of
the longitudinal data provided by cohort studies. Methods: A method for

other widely used approaches to the problem on both real and simulated

tasks such as the partitioning of longitudinal datasets into non-spherical
clusters. Conclusion: Deep artificial neural networks can be used to visualize
longitudinal data in a low dimensional manifold that is much simpler to
interpret than traditional longitudinal plots are. Consequently, practitioners
should start considering the use of deep artificial neural networks for the

gravitational sedimentation can affect significantly the abundances of helium
and heavy elements in the intracluster gas of massive galaxy clusters. The
self-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature
relation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of
sedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the
Universe. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex
scaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other
parameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important
fact is that early-type galaxies can show both decreasing and increasing radial
temperature profiles. We have calculated the diffusion based on the observed
gas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that
belonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray
luminosities. To estimate the maximum effect of sedimentation and thermal
diffusion, we have solved the full set of Burgers' equations for a
non-magnetized ISM plasma. The results obtained demonstrate a considerable
increase of the He/H ratio within one effective radius for all galaxies of our
sample. For galaxies with a flat or declining radial temperature profile the
average increase of the helium abundance is 60\% in one billion years of
diffusion. The revealed effect can introduce a significant bias in the metal
abundance measurements based on X-ray spectroscopy and can affect the evolution
of stars that could be formed from a gas with a high helium abundance.

reflect the intelligent level of USV. In order to solve the problem of global
path planning of USV, this paper proposes an improved A* algorithm for sailing
cost optimization based on electronic charts. This paper uses the S-57
electronic chart to realize the establishment of the octree grid environment
model, and proposes an improved A* algorithm based on sailing safety weight,
pilot quantity and path curve smoothing to ensure the safety of the route,
reduce the planning time, and improve path smoothness. The simulation results
show that the environmental model construction method and the improved A*
algorithm can generate safe and reasonable global path.

gait stability. Two variants of the method exist: the short-term divergence
exponent (DE), and the long-term DE. Only the short-term DE can predict fall
risk. The significance of long-term DE has been unclear so far. Some studies
have suggested that the complex, fractal-like structure of fluctuations among
consecutive strides correlates with long-term DE. The aim, therefore, was to
assess whether the long-term DE is a gait complexity index. The study
reanalyzed a dataset of trunk accelerations from 100 healthy adults walking at
preferred speed on a treadmill for 10 minutes. By interpolation, the stride
intervals were modified within the acceleration signals for the purpose of
conserving the original shape of the signal, while imposing a known
stride-to-stride fluctuation structure. 4 types of hybrid signals with
different noise structures were built: constant, anti-correlated, random, and
correlated (fractal). Short- and long-term DEs were then computed. The results
show that long-term DEs, but not short-term DEs, are sensitive to the noise
structure of stride intervals. It was that observed that random hybrid signals
exhibited significantly lower long-term DEs than hybrid correlated signals did
(0.100 vs 0.144, i.e. a 44% difference). Long-term DEs from constant hybrid
signals were close to zero (0.006). Short-term DEs of anti-correlated, random,
and correlated hybrid signals were closely grouped (2.49, 2.50, and 2.51). The
short- and long-term DEs, although they are both computed from divergence
curves, should not be interpreted in a similar way. The long-term DE is very
likely an index of gait complexity, which may be associated with gait
automaticity or cautiousness. To better differentiate between short- and
long-term DEs, the use of the term attractor complexity index (ACI) is proposed
for the latter.

graphical representations of proofs which are canonical in the sense that they
abstract away syntactic redundancy such as the order of non-interacting rules.
We argue that Girard's extension to MLL1 (first-order MLL) fails to be
canonical because of redundant existential witnesses, and present canonical
MLL1 proof nets called unification nets without them. For example, while there
are infinitely many cut-free Girard nets $\forall x Px \vdash \exists xPx$, one
per arbitrary choice of witness for $\exists x$, there is a unique cut-free
unification net, with no specified witness.
  Redundant existential witnesses cause Girard's MLL1 nets to suffer from
severe complexity issues: (1) cut elimination is non-local and exponential-time
(and -space), and (2) some sequents require exponentially large cut-free Girard
nets. Unification nets solve both problems: (1) cut elimination is local and
linear-time, and (2) cut-free unification nets grow linearly with the size of
the sequent. Since some unification nets are exponentially smaller than
corresponding Girard nets and sequent proofs, technical delicacy is required to
ensure correctness is polynomial-time (quadratic).
  These results extend beyond MLL1 via a broader methodological insight: for
canonical quantifiers, the standard parallel/sequential dichotomy of proof nets
fails; an implicit/explicit witness dichotomy is also needed. Work in progress
extends unification nets to additives and uses them to extend combinatorial
proofs [Proofs without syntax, Annals of Mathematics, 2006] to classical
first-order logic.

filamentary structure emanating from A-nucleus, which we interpret as an
outflow that extends up to at least 14 arcseconds from the A-nucleus in the N-S

extended emission of the entire galaxy system. We also discuss HST/NICMOS

which show similar features to those unveiled by our 150 MHz LOFAR
observations, thus giving string morphological support for the outflow
scenario. Finally, we discuss unpublished NaI D spectra that confirm the
outflow nature of this structure. From energetic arguments, we rule out the
low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in Arp$\,$299-A as a driver for the
outflow. On the contrary, the powerful, compact starburst in the central
regions of Arp$\,$299-A provides plenty of mechanical energy to sustain an
outflow, and we conclude that the intense supernova (SN) activity in the
nuclear region of Arp299-A is driving the observed outflow. We estimate that
the starburst wind can support a mass-outflow rate in the range (11-63) $\rm
M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ at speeds of up to (370 - 890) $\rm km \, s^{-1}$, and is
relatively young, with an estimated kinematic age of (3 - 7) Myr. Those results
open an avenue to the use of low-frequency (150 MHz), sub-arcsecond imaging

this property are given by the $SO(3,1)$ group with the little groups
$SU(2),E^{c}(2)$ and $SU(1,1)$ where the group $E^{c}(2)$ is the central

Seq2seq models have trouble preserving global latent information from a long
sequence of words. Variational autoencoder (VAE) alleviates this problem by
learning a continuous semantic space of the input sentence. However, it does
not solve the problem completely. In this paper, we propose a new recurrent
neural network (RNN)-based Seq2seq model, RNN semantic variational autoencoder
(RNN--SVAE), to better capture the global latent information of a sequence of
words. To reflect the meaning of words in a sentence properly, without regard
to its position within the sentence, we construct a document information vector
using the attention information between the final state of the encoder and
every prior hidden state. Then, the mean and standard deviation of the
continuous semantic space are learned by using this vector to take advantage of
the variational method. By using the document information vector to find the
semantic space of the sentence, it becomes possible to better capture the
global latent feature of the sentence. Experimental results of three natural

discussed. In the past, in incompressible limit it has been observed that the

outside a circular vortex, can lead to quasistationary vortex patch and
transient hole pattern inside the patch via nonlinear merger process. These
patterns are akin to \textquoteleft vortex crystals\textquoteright.
Compressibility can introduce a natural acoustic scale to the problem. We find
that the natural mode is independent of the number of point-like vortices and
the amplitude scales linearly with compressibility. Further it has been
identified that after merging, the system exhibits oscillation at a natural
frequency together with its harmonics and beats with its own harmonics. The
power of the frequency is found to scale as $M^{-2}$, where $M$ is the Mach
number. Also the vortex crystals formed out of the merging process are found to
melt faster as compressibility is increased.

with implications for pension and health-care policy as well as for decisions
made by private companies about life insurance and annuity pricing. Stochastic
mortality forecasts allow the uncertainty in mortality predictions to be taken
into consideration when making policy decisions and setting product prices.
Longer lifespans imply that forecasts of mortality at ages 90 and above will
become more important in such calculations.
  This paper presents a Bayesian approach to the forecasting of mortality that
jointly estimates a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) for mortality for the
majority of the age-range and a parametric model for older ages where the data
are sparser. The GAM allows smooth components to be estimated for age, cohort
and age-specific improvement rates, together with a non-smoothed period effect.
Forecasts for the United Kingdom are produced using data from the Human
Mortality Database spanning the period 1961-2013. A metric that approximates
predictive accuracy under Leave-One-Out cross-validation is used to estimate
weights for the `stacking' of forecasts with different points of transition
between the GAM and parametric elements.
  Mortality for males and females are estimated separately at first, but a
joint model allows the asymptotic limit of mortality at old ages to be shared
between sexes, and furthermore provides for forecasts accounting for
correlations in period innovations. The joint and single sex model forecasts
estimated using data from 1961-2003 are compared against observed data from
2004-2013 to facilitate model assessment.

duration since it varies significantly depending on the patient condition,
surgeon skills, and intraoperative situation. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning pipeline, referred to as RSDNet, which automatically estimates the
remaining surgery duration (RSD) intraoperatively by using only visual
information from laparoscopic videos. Previous state-of-the-art approaches for
RSD prediction are dependent on manual annotation, whose generation requires
expensive expert knowledge and is time-consuming, especially considering the
numerous types of surgeries performed in a hospital and the large number of
laparoscopic videos available. A crucial feature of RSDNet is that it does not
depend on any manual annotation during training, making it easily scalable to
many kinds of surgeries. The generalizability of our approach is demonstrated
by testing the pipeline on two large datasets containing different types of
surgeries: 120 cholecystectomy and 170 gastric bypass videos. The experimental
results also show that the proposed network significantly outperforms a
traditional method of estimating RSD without utilizing manual annotation.
Further, this work provides a deeper insight into the deep learning network

many promising candidates, V2O5 is one of the most interesting cathode
materials. While having very high theoretical capacity, in practice, its
performance is hindered by low stability and poor conductivity. As regards
theoretical descriptions of V2O5, common DFT-GGA calculations fail to reproduce
both the electronic and crystal structure. While the band gap is
underestimated, the interlayer spacing is overestimated as weak dispersion
interactions are not properly described within GGA. Here we show that the
combination of the DFT+U method and semi-empirical D2 correction can compensate
for the drawbacks of the GGA approximation when it comes to the modelling of
V2O5. When compared to common PBE calculations, with a modest increase of the
computational cost, PBE+U+D2 fully reproduced the experimental band gap of
V2O5, while the errors in the lattice parameters are only a few percent. Using
the proposed PBE+U+D2 methodology we studied V2O5 doped with 3d elements (from
Sc to Zn). We show that both the structural and electronic parameters are
affected by doping. Most importantly, a significant increase of conductivity is
expected upon doping, which is of great importance for the application of V2O5
in metal-ion batteries.

Embedding (PFE) -- for image segmentation. Based on the theory of sparse signal
recovery, piecewise flat embedding with diverse channels attempts to recover a
piecewise constant image representation with sparse region boundaries and
sparse cluster value scattering. The resultant piecewise flat embedding
exhibits interesting properties such as suppressing slowly varying signals, and
offers an image representation with higher region identifiability which is
desirable for image segmentation or high-level semantic analysis tasks. We
formulate our embedding as a variant of the Laplacian Eigenmap embedding with
an $L_{1,p} (0<p\leq1)$ regularization term to promote sparse solutions. First,
we devise a two-stage numerical algorithm based on Bregman iterations to
compute $L_{1,1}$-regularized piecewise flat embeddings. We further generalize
this algorithm through iterative reweighting to solve the general
$L_{1,p}$-regularized problem. To demonstrate its efficacy, we integrate PFE
into two existing image segmentation frameworks, segmentation based on
clustering and hierarchical segmentation based on contour detection.
Experiments on four major benchmark datasets, BSDS500, MSRC, Stanford

the conception of breaking inversion symmetry within the unit cell of a
honeycomb lattice for cylindrical and spherical resonators; we further
demonstrate the robustness of the wave propagation along a zig-zag path
containing sharp corners, defect and disorder. The wave propagation ceases to
be preserved if we increase the degree of disorder along the zig-zag path. In
parallel, the conventional interface state is also designed and compared to the
same situations. We found that the conventional interface state suffers back
scattering in the zig-zag path while it can show a more confined wave transport
in some cases. The presence of a defect along the propagation path scatters the
conventional interface wave and in particular can prohibit a full propagation
in presence of a localized state at the defect. If the zig-zag path is made
disordered, the propagation of the conventional interface mode can be conserved
at given frequencies for a low random degree and disappears for higher random
degree as the interface bands become flat in dispersion and turn to localized
states. Finally, we show that the immunity of the topologically protected
design needs the interface to be surrounded by at least two hexagons of the
phononic crystals on both sides, especially at the sharp corners in the zig-zag
path, while the conventional design only needs one hexagon bulk media with the
advantage of compact wave transport. This work puts a step forward for the
interface states in micro-/nano-scale characterization and figures out the
behaviors for both topologically protected and conventional interface states.

video sequence, low-level visual features are extracted based on optic flow and
then clustered into different atomic activities and video clips are clustered
into different interactions. The HDP model automatically decide the number of
clusters, i.e. the categories of atomic activities and interactions. Based on
the learned atomic activities and interactions, a training dataset is generated
to train the Gaussian Process (GP) classifier. Then the trained GP models work
in newly captured video to classify interactions and detect abnormal events in
real time. Furthermore, the temporal dependencies between video events learned
by HDP-Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are effectively integrated into GP classifier
to enhance the accuracy of the classification in newly captured videos. Our
framework couples the benefits of the generative model (HDP) with the
discriminant model (GP). We provide detailed experiments showing that our
framework enjoys favorable performance in video event classification in
real-time in a crowded traffic scene.

almost all of their hydrogen envelopes. This mass loss is often triggered by
common envelope interactions with close stellar or even substellar companions.
Cool companions like late-type stars or brown dwarfs are detectable via
characteristic light curve variations like reflection effects and often also
eclipses. To search for such objects we obtained multi-band light curves of 26
close sdO/B binary candidates from the MUCHFUSS project with the BUSCA
instrument. We discovered a new eclipsing reflection effect system
($P=0.168938$~d) with a low-mass M dwarf companion ($0.116 M_{\rm \odot}$).
Three more reflection effect binaries found in the course of the campaign were
already published, two of them are eclipsing systems, in one system only
showing the reflection effect but no eclipses the sdB primary is found to be
pulsating. Amongst the targets without reflection effect a new long-period sdB
pulsator was discovered and irregular light variations were found in two sdO
stars. The found light variations allowed us to constrain the fraction of
reflection effect binaries and the substellar companion fraction around sdB
stars. The minimum fraction of reflection effect systems amongst the close sdB
binaries might be greater than 15\% and the fraction of close substellar
companions in sdB binaries might be as high as $8.0\%$. This would result in a
close substellar companion fraction to sdB stars of about 3\%. This fraction is
much higher than the fraction of brown dwarfs around possible progenitor
systems, which are solar-type stars with substellar companions around 1 AU, as
well as close binary white dwarfs with brown dwarf companions. This might be a

preferentially followed by a hot subdwarf phase.

the successful transmission probability (STP) of a file, we consider
retransmissions with random discontinuous transmission (DTX) in a large-scale

We analyze and optimize the STP in two mobility scenarios, i.e., the high
mobility scenario and the static scenario. First, in each scenario, by using
tools from stochastic geometry, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the
STP in the general and low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) threshold
regimes, respectively. The analysis shows that a larger caching probability
corresponds to a higher STP in both scenarios; random DTX can improve the STP
in the static scenario and its benefit gradually diminishes when mobility
increases. Then, in each scenario, we consider the maximization of the STP with
respect to the caching probability and the BS activity probability, which is a
challenging non-convex optimization problem. In particular, in the high
mobility scenario, we obtain a globally optimal solution using interior point
method. In the static scenario, we develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm
to obtain a stationary point using alternating optimization. Finally, numerical
results show that the proposed solutions achieve significant gains over
existing baseline schemes and can well adapt to the changes of the system

performance of existing methods? is there still room for improvement? under
which conditions should one technique be preferred over another? does adding

scaling studies, network analysis, and realistic system benchmarks for graph

random hyperbolic graphs, generated by distributing points within a disk in the
hyperbolic plane and then adding edges between points with a probability
depending on their hyperbolic distance.
  We present a dynamic extension to model gradual network change, while
preserving at each step the point position probabilities. To process the
dynamic changes efficiently, we formalize the concept of a probabilistic
neighborhood: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in Euclidean or hyperbolic space,
$q$ a query point, $\operatorname{dist}$ a distance metric, and $f :
\mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow [0,1]$ a monotonically decreasing function. Then, the
probabilistic neighborhood $N(q, f)$ of $q$ with respect to $f$ is a random
subset of $P$ and each point $p \in P$ belongs to $N(q,f)$ with probability
$f(\operatorname{dist}(p,q))$. We present a fast, sublinear-time query
algorithm to sample probabilistic neighborhoods from planar point sets. For
certain distributions of planar $P$, we prove that our algorithm answers a
query in $O((|N(q,f)| + \sqrt{n})\log n)$ time with high probability. This
enables us to process a node movement in random hyperbolic graphs in sublinear
time, resulting in a speedup of about one order of magnitude in practice
compared to the fastest previous approach. Apart from that, our query algorithm
is also applicable to Euclidean geometry, making it of independent interest for
other sampling or probabilistic spreading scenarios.

error estimator is sharp with efficiency index close to one, if the Kolmogorov
N-with decays fast for the underlying problem and if a suitable saturation
assumption for the reduced approximation is satisfied. We investigate the
tightness of the hierarchical a posteriori estimator both from a theoretical
and numerical perspective. For the respective approximation with higher
accuracy we study and compare basis enrichment of Lagrange- and Taylor-type
reduced bases. Numerical experiments indicate the efficiency for both, the
construction of a reduced basis using the hierarchical error estimator in a
weak Greedy algorithm, and for tight online certification of reduced
approximations. This is particularly relevant in cases where the $\inf$-$\sup$

tests of General Relativity in the strong-field regime. In particular,
deviations from General Relativity can be observed by comparing incoming
signals to waveform templates that include parametrized deviations from General
Relativity. However, it is essential that the General Relativity sector of
these templates accounts for all predictable physics. Otherwise, missing
physics might be mimicked by the ""beyond General Relativity"" sector of the
templates, leading the analysis to report apparent deviations from General
Relativity. Current parametrized tests implement templates that omit physical
phenomena such as orbital eccentricity and higher-order modes. In this paper,
we show how the omission of higher modes can lead to false deviations from
General Relativity when these effects are strong enough. We study the extent of
these deviations as a function of the mass ratio and the orbital orientation.
We find that significant false deviations can arise when current tests are
performed on signals emitted by asymmetric binaries whose orbital angular
momentum is orthogonal to the line-of-sight. We estimate that the Advanced
LIGO-Virgo network operating at its design sensitivity can observe false
violations with a significance above $5 \sigma$ as often as once per year.
Similar results are expected for other tests of General Relativity that use
modified waveform models. Hence, we stress the necessity of accurate waveform
models that include physical effects such as higher-order modes to trust future
tests of General Relativity.

simply solving a linear equation system; no backpropagation or similar methods

article, the size of an LRNN can be reduced significantly in one step after
inspecting the spectrum of the network transition matrix, i.e., its
eigenvalues, by taking only the most relevant components. Therefore, in
contrast to other approaches, we do not only learn network weights but also the
network architecture. LRNNs have interesting properties: They end up in ellipse
trajectories in the long run and allow the prediction of further values and
compact representations of functions. We demonstrate this by several

concern across disciplines and stakeholder groups. Funding agencies and
journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention,
often focusing on the so-called ""crisis"" of reproducibility. One big problem
keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are
using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad
sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology
via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words
reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are
commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a
minimum standard of ""same data+same methods=same results,"" to ""new data and/or
new methods in an independent study=same findings,"" group 1 calls the minimum
standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the
two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the
terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help
us resolve the contradictions.

non-overlapping partially reactive spherical sinks or obstacles). We consider
both exterior and interior problems and all most common boundary conditions:
Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and conjugate one. Using the translational addition
theorems for solid harmonics to switch between the local spherical coordinates,
we obtain a semi-analytical expression of the Green function as a linear
combination of partial solutions whose coefficients are fixed by boundary
conditions. Although the numerical computation of the coefficients involves
series truncation and matrix inversion, the use of the solid harmonics as basis
functions naturally adapted to the intrinsic symmetries of the problem makes
the GMSV particularly efficient, especially for exterior problems. The obtained
Green function is the key ingredient to solve boundary value problems and to
determine various characteristics of stationary diffusion such as reaction
rate, escape probability, harmonic measure, residence time, and mean first
passage time, to name but a few. The relevant aspects of the numerical
implementation and potential applications in chemical physics, heat transfer,

been determined using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) method, which has a wide
use in artificial neural networks (ANNs). The effect levels derived from MLP
have been then used as the weight levels of the decision criteria in APLOCO.

criteria in APLOCO. According to the results obtained from APLOCO, Istanbul

alternatives are Manisa, Denizli, Izmir, Kocaeli, Bursa, Ankara, Adana, and

fracture on a prescribed crack surface, in small-strain antiplane elasticity.
The main feature of the model is that the density of the energy dissipated in
the fracture process depends on the total variation of the amplitude of the
jump. Thus, any change in the crack opening entails a loss of energy, until the
crack is complete. In particular this implies a fatigue phenomenon, i.e., a
complete fracture may be produced by oscillation of small jumps.
  The first step of the existence proof is the construction of approximate
evolutions obtained by solving discrete-time incremental minimum problems. The
main difficulty in the passage to the continuous-time limit is that we lack of
controls on the variations of the jump of the approximate evolutions. Therefore
we resort to a weak formulation where the variation of the jump is replaced by
a Young measure. Eventually, after proving the existence in this weak
formulation, we improve the result by showing that the Young measure is
concentrated on a function and coincides with the variation of the jump of the
displacement.

properties. It is based on the surface-plasmon-polariton-assisted transverse
magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE). In our experiments, sub-100 nm-thick
bismuth-substituted lutetium iron-garnet films covered with a plasmonic gold
grating have been analyzed. The excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons
provides resonance enhancement of TMOKE up to 0.04 and makes it easily
detectable in the experiment. For films thicker than 40 nm, the TMOKE
marginally depends on the film thickness. A further decrease in the film
thickness diminishes TMOKE since for such thicknesses the surface
plasmon-polariton field partly penetrates inside the non-magnetic substrate.
Nevertheless, the TMOKE remains measurable even for few-nm-thick films, which
makes this technique unique for the magneto-optical study of ultra-thin films.
Particularly, the proposed method reveals that the off-diagonal components of
the magnetic film permittivity tensor grow slightly with the reduction of the
film thickness.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1708.08810",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC)
network, where the distributed energy-harvesting wireless devices (WDs) are
powered by means of radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT). In
particular, the WDs follow a binary computation offloading policy, i.e., data
set of a computing task has to be executed as a whole either locally or
remotely at the MEC server via task offloading. We are interested in maximizing
the (weighted) sum computation rate of all the WDs in the network by jointly
optimizing the individual computing mode selection (i.e., local computing or
offloading) and the system transmission time allocation (on WPT and task
offloading). The major difficulty lies in the combinatorial nature of
multi-user computing mode selection and its strong coupling with transmission
time allocation. To tackle this problem, we propose a joint optimization method
based on the ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) decomposition
technique. Simulation results show that the proposed method can efficiently
achieve near-optimal performance under various network setups, and
significantly outperform the other representative benchmark methods considered.
Besides, using both theoretical analysis and numerical study, we show that the
proposed method enjoys low computational complexity against the increase of
networks size.

intersections. In classical gap acceptance models vehicles on the minor road
accept any gap greater than the CRITICAL gap, and reject gaps below this
threshold, where the gap is the time between two subsequent vehicles on the
major road. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a series of
generalizations of existing models, thus increasing the model's practical
applicability significantly. First, we incorporate {driver impatience behavior}
while allowing for a realistic merging behavior; we do so by distinguishing
between the critical gap and the merging time, thus allowing MULTIPLE vehicles
to use a sufficiently large gap. Incorporating this feature is particularly
challenging in models with driver impatience. Secondly, we allow for multiple
classes of gap acceptance behavior, enabling us to distinguish between
different driver types and/or different vehicle types. Thirdly, we use the
novel M$^X$/SM2/1 queueing model, which has batch arrivals, dependent service
times, and a different service-time distribution for vehicles arriving in an
empty queue on the minor road (where `service time' refers to the time required
to find a sufficiently large gap). This setup facilitates the analysis of the
service-time distribution of an arbitrary vehicle on the minor road and of the
queue length on the minor road. In particular, we can compute the MEAN service
time, thus enabling the evaluation of the capacity for the minor road vehicles.

suffers from the issue of solar radiation reflected by the target during
heating stage, and issues of potential non-uniform heat distribution. These
limitations are the major constraints of the traditional single thermal image
method. Time series-based methods such as Fourier transform-based pulse phase
thermography, principle component thermography, and high order statistics have
been reported with robust results on surface reflective property difference and
non-uniform heat distribution under the experimental setting. This paper aims
to compare the performance of above methods to that of the conventional static
thermal imaging method. The case used for the comparison is to detect voids in
a hollow concrete block during the heating phase. The result was quantitatively
evaluated by using Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Favorable performance was observed
using time-series methods compared to the single image approach.

function of humans and primates; it responds to visual stimuli prior to the
development of any symbolic skills, language or arithmetic. Given successes of
deep learning (DL) in tasks of visual intelligence and given the primitivity of
number sense, a tantalizing question is whether DL can comprehend numbers and
perform subitizing. But somewhat disappointingly, extensive experiments of the
type of cognitive psychology demonstrate that the examples-driven black box DL
cannot see through superficial variations in visual representations and distill
the abstract notion of natural number, a task that children perform with high
accuracy and confidence. The failure is apparently due to the learning method
not the CNN computational machinery itself. A recurrent neural network capable
of subitizing does exist, which we construct by encoding a mechanism of
mathematical morphology into the CNN convolutional kernels. Also, we
investigate, using subitizing as a test bed, the ways to aid the black box DL
by cognitive priors derived from human insight. Our findings are mixed and
interesting, pointing to both cognitive deficit of pure DL, and some measured
successes of boosting DL by predetermined cognitive implements. This case study

bistability above a critical flow rate. The novelty lies in two asymmetric
modifications to the geometry, which causes a change in the bifurcation diagram
such that one of the stable solutions becomes disconnected from the solution at
low flow speeds. First we show that it is possible to mirror one of the
modifications such that the system can be forced to the disconnected solution.
Then we show that a slow decrease of the flow rate, can cause the system to go
through a drastic change on a short time scale, also known as a catastrophe.
The short time scale could lead to a precise and simple experimental
measurement of the flow conditions at which the viscoelastic catastrophe
occurs. Since the phenomena is intrinsically related to the extensional

to its tissues, resulting in a 28 - 50% mortality rate. Clinical trials for
sepsis treatment over the last 20 years have failed to produce a single
currently FDA approved drug treatment. In this study, we attempt to discover an
effective cytokine mediation treatment strategy for sepsis using a previously
developed agent-based model that simulates the innate immune response to
infection: the Innate Immune Response agent-based model (IIRABM). Previous
attempts at reducing mortality with multi-cytokine mediation using the IIRABM
have failed to reduce mortality across all patient parameterizations and
motivated us to investigate whether adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine
mediation can control the trajectory of sepsis and lower patient mortality. We
used the IIRABM to compute a treatment policy in which systemic patient
measurements are used in a feedback loop to inform future treatment. Using deep
reinforcement learning, we identified a policy that achieves 0% mortality on
the patient parameterization on which it was trained. More importantly, this
policy also achieves 0.8% mortality over 500 randomly selected patient
parameterizations with baseline mortalities ranging from 1 - 99% (with an
average of 49%) spanning the entire clinically plausible parameter space of the
IIRABM. These results suggest that adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine
mediation therapy could be a promising approach for treating sepsis. We hope
that this work motivates researchers to consider such an approach as part of
future clinical trials. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
consider adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation therapy for sepsis,
and is the first to exploit deep reinforcement learning on a biological
