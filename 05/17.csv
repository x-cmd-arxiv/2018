environments in a whole-sky $\Lambda$CDM light-cone halo catalogue extending to

The isolation status of each individual dark matter halo is determined by the
distance to its nearest neighbour, which defines the maximum spherical region
devoid of halos above a threshold mass around it (although the true size of
such region may be much larger since it is not necessarily spherical). A
versatile double power-law Schechter function is used to fit the dark matter
halo AF, and its derived parameters are studied as a function of halo isolation
status. Results. (a) Our function fits the halo abundances for all halo
isolation statuses extremely well, while the well-established theoretical mass
functions, integrated over the volume of the light-cone, provide an adequate
but poorer fit than our phenomenological model. (b) As expected, and in
agreement with other studies based on snap-shot simulations, we find
significant differences of the halo abundance function as a function of halo
isolation, indicating different rates of halo formation. The slope of the power
law and the characteristic mass of the Schechter-like fitting function decrease
with isolation, a result consistent with the formation of less massive haloes
in lower density regions. (c) We find an unexpected upturn of the
characteristic mass of the most isolated haloes of our sample. This upturn
originates and characterises only the higher redshift regime (z > 0.45), which
probably implies a significant and recent evolution of the isolation status of
the most isolated and most massive haloes.

attribute-based access control via attribute-based delegation (ABD).
Attribute-based delegation allows a large number of cross-domain attribute
issuers to be used in making authorization decisions. Attributes are not only
issued to identities, but can also be delegated to other attributes issued by
different entities in the system. The resulting trust chains can then be
resolved by any entity given an appropriate attribute storage and resolution

analyses to assess the effect of a given factor on the risk of being
responsible for an accident, among drivers involved in an accident only. Using
the SCM framework, we formally showed in previous works that the causal
odds-ratio of a given factor correlated with high speed cannot be unbiasedly
estimated through responsibility analyses if inclusion into the dataset depends
on the accident severity. The objective of this present work is to present
numerical results to give a first quantification of the magnitude of the
selection bias induced by responsibility analyses. We denote the binary
variables by X the exposure of interest, V the high speed, F the driving fault,
R the responsibility of a severe accident, A the severe accident, and W a set
of categorical confounders. We illustrate the potential bias by comparing the
causal effect of interest of X on R, COR(X,R|W=w), and the estimable odds-ratio
available in responsibility analyses, OR(X,R|W=w, A=1). By considering a binary
exposure, and by varying a set of parameters, we describe a situation where X
could represent alcohol or cannabis intoxication. We confirm that the estimable
odds-ratio available in responsibility analyses is a biased measure of the
causal effect when X is correlated with high speed V and V is related to the
accident severity A. In this case, the magnitude of the bias is all the more
important that these two relationships are strong. When X is likely to increase
the risk to drive fast V, the estimable odds-ratio underestimates the causal
effect. When X is likely to decrease the risk to drive fast V, the estimable
odds-ratio upperestimates the causal effect. The values of the different causal
quantities considered here are from one to five times higher (or lower) than
the estimable quantity available in responsability analyses.

observed that the view descriptors learned by the network are much more

kinematic regime of such a machine. While it would be convenient to assume that
such objects are narrow and can be treated in the so-called Narrow Width
Approximation (NWA), this is not always possible, owing to the fact that
couplings and particle content of such new physics scenarios are not generally
constrained, so that a large value of the former and/or a large variety of VLQ
decay channels into the latter can contribute to generate a large decay width
for such extra quarks. We have addressed here the issue of how best to tackle
in LHC analysis the presence of large (and model-dependent) interference
effects between different VLQ production and decay channels as well as between
these and the corresponding irreducible background. We have confined ourselves
to the case of single production of VLQs, which is rapidly becoming a channel
of choice in experimental searches owing to the ever increasing limits on their
mass, in turn depleting the yield of the historically well-established double
production channel. Indeed, this poses a further challenge, as the former is
model-dependent while the latter is essentially not. Despite these conditions,
we show here that an efficient approach is possible, which retains to a large

graphics processing unit (GPU) systems. As more applications share a single
system, operations from each application can contend with each other at various
shared components. Such contention can slow down each application or thread of
execution. The compound effect of contention, high memory latency and access
overheads, as well as inefficient management of resources, greatly degrades
performance, quality-of-service, and energy efficiency. The ten works featured
in this issue study several aspects of (1) inter-application interference in
multicore systems, heterogeneous systems, and GPUs; (2) the growing overheads
and expenses associated with growing memory densities and latencies; and (3)
performance, programmability, and portability issues in modern GPUs, especially
those related to memory system resources.

using a small sampling of the data generated by Monte Carlo method, the

theoretically, and the uncertain parameters in the theoretical models are
fitted by utilizing the trained ANNs. More importantly, our results demonstrate
that this model-driven method not only realizes the inverse design of the PWCCS
with high precision but also optimizes some critical performance metrics for

useful to model the signal propagation loss between a proposed antenna location
and the areas it may cover. The indoor dominant path (IDP) model, introduced by
W\""{o}lfle et al., is shown in the literature to have good validation and
generalization error, is faster to compute than competing methods, and is used
in commercial software such as WinProp, iBwave Design, and CellTrace.
Previously, the algorithms known for computing it involved a worst-case
exponential-time tree search, with pruning heuristics to speed it up.
  We prove that the IDP model can be reduced to a parametric shortest path
computation on a graph derived from the walls in the floorplan. It therefore
admits a quasipolynomial-time (i.e., $n^{O(\log n)}$) algorithm. We also give a
practical approximation algorithm based on running a small constant number of
shortest path computations. Its provable worst-case additive error (in dB) can
be made arbitrarily small via appropriate choices of parameters, and is well
below 1dB for reasonable choices. We evaluate our approximation algorithm
empirically against the exact IDP model, and show that it consistently beats
its theoretical worst-case bounds, solving the model exactly (i.e., no error)
in the vast majority of cases.

the competition between cooperators and defectors on integer lattices.
Regardless of their type, individuals die at rate one. Defectors give birth at
a fixed rate whereas cooperators give birth at a rate that increases linearly
with the number of nearby cooperators. In particular, it is assumed that only
cooperators benefit from cooperators, which is referred to as kin-recognition
in the ecological literature. To understand how the inclusion of space in the
form of local interactions affects the dynamics, the results for the
interacting particle system are compared with their counterpart for the
non-spatial mean-field model. Due to some monotonicity with respect to the
parameters, both the spatial and non-spatial models exhibit a unique phase
transition. Our analysis shows however a major difference: In the spatial
model, when cooperation is strong enough, the cooperators out-compete the
defectors even when starting at arbitrarily low density. In contrast,
regardless of the strength of cooperation, when the initial density of
cooperators is too low, the defectors out-compete the cooperators in the
non-spatial model. In particular, when cooperation is sufficiently strong, the
cooperators can invade the defectors in their equilibrium in the spatial model
but not in the non-spatial model, showing that space in the form of local
interactions promotes cooperation.

Milky Way (MW) and other spirals is that higher gas accretion rates are
expected in the past, and in the inner regions of the Galaxy. This leads to the
so-called `inside-out disc formation scenario'. Yet, these are probably the
most unconstrained inputs of such models. In the present paper, we aim at
investigating these main assumptions by studying how gas is accreted in four
simulated MW-like galaxies assembled within the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. The
galaxies were obtained using two different simulation techniques, cosmological
setups and initial conditions. Two of them are MW candidates corresponding to
the chemodynamical model of Minchev et al. (2013, 2014) (known as MCM) and the
Local Group cosmological simulation of Nuza et al. (2014). We investigate
vertical and radial gas accretion on to galaxy discs as a function of cosmic
time and disc radius. We find that accretion in the MW-like galaxies seem to
happen in two distinct phases, namely: an early, more violent period; followed
by a subsequent, slowly declining phase. Our simulations seem to give support
to the assumption that the amount of gas incorporated into the MW disc
exponentially decreases with time, leading to current net accretion rates of
$0.6-1\,$M$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. In particular, accretion timescales on to the
simulated thin-disc-like structures are within $\sim5-7\,$Gyr, consistent with
expectations from CEMs. Moreover, our simulated MW discs are assembled from the
inside-out with gas in the inner disc regions accreted in shorter timescales
than in external ones, in qualitative agreement with CEMs of the Galaxy.
However, this type of growth is not general to all galaxies and it is
intimately linked to their particular merger and gas accretion history.

our understanding of interfaces in active systems is still in its infancy.
Here, we study the evolution of an active-passive interface using a model
active matter system, bacterial swarms. We use ultra-violet light exposure to
create compact domains of passive bacteria within Serratia marcescens swarms,
thereby creating interfaces separating motile and immotile cells.
Post-exposure, the boundary re-shapes and erodes due to self-emergent
collective flows. We demonstrate that the active-passive boundary acts as a
diffuse interface with mechanical properties set by the flow. Intriguingly,
interfacial velocity couples to local swarm speed and interface curvature,
suggesting that an active analogue to classic Gibbs-Thomson-Stefan conditions
controls boundary propagation. Our results generalize interface theories to
mixing and segregation in active systems with collective flows.

simultaneously a high power factor and low thermal conductivity. An effective
approach for increasing the power factor is to align the band extremum and
achieve high band degeneracy ($\geq$ 12) near the Fermi level as realized in
PbTe [\textcolor{blue}{Pei et. al. \textit{Nature} 473, 66 (2010)}], which
usually relies on band structure engineering, e.g., chemical doping and strain.
However, very few materials could achieve such a high band degeneracy without
heavy doping or suffering impractical strain. By employing state-of-the-art
first-principles methods with direct computation of phonon and carrier
lifetime, we demonstrate that two new full-Heusler compounds Li$_2$TlBi and
Li$_2$InBi, possessing a PbTe-like electronic structure, show exceptionally
high power factors ($\sim$ 20 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at 300 K) and low lattice
thermal conductivities (2.36 and 1.55 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) at room temperature.
The Tl$^{+}$Bi$^{3-}$ (In$^{+}$Bi$^{3-}$) sublattice forms a rock-salt
structure, and the additional two valence electrons from Li atoms essentially
make these compounds isovalent with Pb$^{2+}$Te$^{2-}$. The larger rock-salt
sublattice of TlBi (InBi) shifts the valence band maximum from L point to the
middle of the $\Sigma$ line, increasing the band degeneracy from fourfold to
twelvefold. On the other hand, resonance bond in the PbTe-like sublattice and
soft Tl-Bi (In-Bi) bonding interaction is responsible for intrinsic low lattice
thermal conductivities. Our results present a novel strategy of designing
high-performance thermoelectric materials.

We show that the discrete gradient method is well-posed by proving the

Moreover, we establish an $O(1/k)$ convergence rate for convex objectives and

dynamical system which generates it. This task can be done by selecting an
appropriate model and a set of parameters which best fits the dynamics while
providing the simplest representation (i.e. the smallest amount of terms). One
such approach is the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics framework [6]
which uses a sparsity-promoting algorithm that iterates between a partial
least-squares fit and a thresholding (sparsity-promoting) step. In this work,
we provide some theoretical results on the behavior and convergence of the
algorithm proposed in [6]. In particular, we prove that the algorithm
approximates local minimizers of an unconstrained $\ell^0$-penalized
least-squares problem. From this, we provide sufficient conditions for general
convergence, rate of convergence, and conditions for one-step recovery.
Examples illustrate that the rates of convergence are sharp. In addition, our
results extend to other algorithms related to the algorithm in [6], and provide
theoretical verification to several observed phenomena.

the case when the shock Mach number is of order a few, and the energy of the
shocked fluid is not conserved but self-consistently modified by the binding
energy of the ambient medium that is swept up by the passage of the shock.
Furthermore, we show that there is one solution (for a given ambient density
profile) that smoothly passes through a sonic point in the post-shock flow and
results in accretion onto the central object; in analogy with the Bondi
problem, we propose that these solutions are the ones that are most relevant in
astrophysical environments. We apply these accreting models to failed
supernovae, in which neutron star formation does not unbind the envelope, but a
weak shock is still generated in the outer layers of the star from
neutrino-induced mass loss. We find excellent agreement between the predictions
of our self-similar, shock propagation model and numerical simulations of the
collapse of a yellow supergiant; the self-similar solutions reproduce the
overall scaling of the shock speed, the time and space-dependent evolution of
the velocity, density, and pressure behind the shock, and the accretion rate
onto the black hole. Our results have important implications for the fallback

quantify the spatial variation of dust emission in the UZ Tau E circumbinary
disk, the observed interferometric visibilities are modeled with a simple
parametric prescription for the radial surface brightnesses at each frequency.
We find evidence that the spectrum steepens with radius in the disk, manifested
as a positive correlation between the observing frequency and the radius that
encircles a fixed fraction of the emission ($R_{eff} \propto \nu^{0.34 \pm
0.08}$). The origins of this size--frequency relation are explored in the
context of a theoretical framework for the growth and migration of disk solids.
While that framework can reproduce a similar size--frequency relation, it
predicts a steeper spectrum than is observed. Moreover, it comes closest to
matching the data only on timescales much shorter ($\le 1$ Myr) than the
putative UZ Tau age (~2-3 Myr). These discrepancies are the direct consequences
of the rapid radial drift rates predicted by models of dust evolution in a
smooth gas disk. One way to mitigate that efficiency problem is to invoke
small-scale gas pressure modulations that locally concentrate drifting solids.
If such particle traps reach high continuum optical depths at 30-340 GHz with a
~30-60% filling fraction in the inner disk ($r \lesssim20$ au), they can also
explain the observed spatial gradient in the UZ Tau E disk spectrum.

inclination, the three BH masses and the inner and outer eccentricities, we
show that retrograde, nearly planar configurations lead to a significant
shrinkage of the inner binary. We find an universal trend of triple systems,
namely that they tend to evolve toward prograde configurations and that the
orbital flip, driven by the torque exerted on the inner BH binary (BHB) by the
outer BH, leads in general to tighter inner orbits that, in some cases, merge
within a Hubble time. We find that the mergers' mass distribution maps the
original BH binary spectrum. A large fraction of merging BHBs with initial
separation $1$ AU enter the $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz frequency band with large
eccentricities, thus representing potential eccentric LISA sources. Mergers
originating from initially tighter BHB ($a\sim 0.01$ AU), instead, often have
eccentricities above 0.7 in the $1$ Hz band. This might imply that eccentric
sources detected in high-frequency detectors are most likely connected with a
high-velocity dispersion stellar environment, whereas eccentric sources
detected in low-frequency detectors are likely to develop in low-density

compression/expansion. A significant reduction of the cooling rate and cooling
flow within 20 kpc from the centre can be achieved with kinetic jets. However,
at larger scales and away from the jet axis, the system relaxes to a cooling
flow configuration. Jet feedback is anisotropic and is mostly distributed along
the jet axis, where the cooling rate is reduced and a significant fraction of
the jet power is converted into kinetic power of heated outflowing gas. Away
from the jet axis weak shock heating represents the dominant heating source.
Turbulent heating is significant only near the cluster centre, but it becomes
inefficient at 50 kpc scales where it only represents a few percent of the
total heating rate. Several details of the simulations depend on the choice
made for the hydro solver, a consequence of the difficulty of achieving proper
numerical convergence for this problem: current physics implementations and
resolutions do not properly capture multi-phase gas that develops as a

setup to trigger general-relativistic (GR) inspiral and merger of binary black

encounters inside such environments. In this work, the intricacies of such
dynamical interactions are probed utilizing realistic, self-consistent,
post-Newtonian, direct N-body evolutionary models of young massive and open
stellar clusters. Particularly, the configurations of the compact subsystems,
that drive the in-cluster GR BBH coalescences, are tracked on the fly. Such an
approach reveals that the GR coalescences within the open clusters take place
primarily via chaotic interactions involving triple BH systems. Although less
frequently, such mergers are found to happen also in higher-order subsystems
such as quadruples and in subsystems involving non-BH members; the mergers can
themselves be BH---non-BH, which events would leave electromagnetic signatures.
Close, fly-by encounters inside the clusters can also make BBHs and other types
of double-compact binaries temporarily post-Newtonian; such binaries would
potentially contribute to the GW background for the LISA and the PTA. These
calculations, furthermore, suggest that open clusters are potential hosts for
not only detached BH---main-sequence binaries, as recently identified in the
globular cluster NGC 3201, but also a wide variety of other types of
remnant---non-remnant binaries, which are assembled via dynamical interactions
inside the clusters and which have the prospects of being discovered in
radial-velocity surveys.

focused on TIs and related topological crystalline insulators in 2D and 3D,
more recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of 1D
symmetry-protected topological phases in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The
topological phase of these laterally-confined, semiconducting strips of
graphene is determined by their width, edge shape, and the terminating unit
cell, and is characterized by a Z2 invariant (similar to 1D solitonic systems).
Interfaces between topologically distinct GNRs characterized by different Z2
are predicted to support half-filled in-gap localized electronic states which
can, in principle, be utilized as a tool for material engineering. Here we
present the rational design and experimental realization of a
topologically-engineered GNR superlattice that hosts a 1D array of such states,
thus generating otherwise inaccessible electronic structure. This strategy also
enables new end states to be engineered directly into the termini of the 1D GNR
superlattice. Atomically-precise topological GNR superlattices were synthesized
from molecular precursors on a Au(111) surface under ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
conditions and characterized by low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) and spectroscopy (STS). Our experimental results and first-principles
calculations reveal that the frontier band structure of these GNR superlattices
is defined purely by the coupling between adjacent topological interface

exponential decay but the decay rate vanishes in the thermodynamic limit in a

propagate at Alfv\'en speeds. The transversal waves and electric currents,
generated by the spicule's driver and lasting for many minutes, are dissipated

that galaxy-scale absorption may play a role in the AGN obscuration at
intermediate (i.e. Compton-thin) column densities. We derived a molecular gas
column density of $(8.0\pm0.9)\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ from the ALMA

from X-ray spectral fitting is $6.8^{+2.1}_{-1.5}\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The

the AGN obscuration; however, the link between them is not straightforward. The
nuclear regions of IRAS 00183-7111 are likely stratified into different layers
of matter: one inner and highly ionized by the strong radiation field of the
AGN (as inferred from the high-ionization iron line found in the X-ray

(as traced by the molecular gas observed with ALMA). The molecular gas regions
also give rise to a vigorous starburst with SFR$\sim260\pm28$ M$_{\odot}$

at discriminating whether the magnetic field or fluid motion plays a primary,
active role in this process. The very origin and early development stage of
Active Region 12548 are investigated based on SDO/HMI observations of 2016 May
20--25. Full-vector magnetic and velocity fields are analyzed in parallel. The
leading and trailing magnetic polarities are found to grow asymmetrically in
terms of their amplitude, magnetic flux, and the time variation of these
quantities. The leading-polarity magnetic element originates as a compact
feature against the background of a distributed trailing-polarity field, with
an already existing trailing-polarity magnetic element. No signs of strong
horizontal magnetic fields are detected between the two magnetic poles. No
predominant upflow between their future locations precedes the origin of this
bipolar magnetic region (BMR); instead, upflows and downflows are mixed, with
some prevalence of downflows. Any signs of a large-scale horizontal divergent
flow from the area where the BMR develops are missing; in contrast, a normal
supergranulation and mesogranulation pattern is preserved. This scenario of
early BMR evolution is in strong contradiction with the expectations based on
the model of a rising $\Omega$-shaped loop of a flux tube of strong magnetic
field, and an \emph{in situ} mechanism of magnetic-field amplification and
structuring should operate in this case.

not well reproduced by the spontaneous emission of optically thin ionized gas,
as would be typical for nebular gas in PNe; (ii) the compact core of Mz 3 is

intensity ratios for Mz 3 are very similar to those in the core emission of the
well known star MWC 349A, where laser effect is responsible for the enhancement
of HRLs in the Herschel wavelength range; (iv) the physical characteristics

Furthermore, it has been suggested that the whole amount of dark matter (DM)

NuSTAR Galactic center (GC) X-ray data. We used a robust Monte Carlo approach
in conjunction with a radiatively inefficient PBH accretion model with commonly

forms of DM density profiles. Most importantly, our study includes treatment of
the gas turbulence, which significantly modifies the relative velocity between
PBHs and gas. We show that inclusion of the effects of gas turbulence and the
uncertainties related to the DM density profile reduces significantly the gas
accretion onto PBHs compared to the claimed values in previous papers. It is
highly improbable to obtain accreting PBHs brighter than the NuSTAR point
source limit using observationally determined gas velocities. As such, one can
safely conclude that GC X-ray observations cannot rule out ${\cal O}(10)

We address these limitations by developing an optimal Gaussian mechanism whose
variance is calibrated directly using the Gaussian cumulative density function

mechanism with a post-processing step based on adaptive estimation techniques
by leveraging that the distribution of the perturbation is known. Our

that integrate drone base stations (drone-BS) and cellular-connected drone
users (drone-UEs), is introduced. For this new 3D cellular architecture, a
novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs as well as latency-minimal
cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable
method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron
shapes is proposed that ensures full coverage for a given space with minimum
number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D
wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency
reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme
is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission,
computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial
distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation
method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a
cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of
drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell
association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from optimal transport
theory. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency
of drone-UEs compared to the classical cell association approach that uses a
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the
proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency
compared to the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed
latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D
wireless cellular network of drones.

at power-based malware detection on general-purpose computers. Leveraging the
fact that malware executions must consume power, we explore the postulate that
malware can be accurately detected via power data analytics. Our experimental
design and implementation allow for programmatic collection of CPU power
profiles for fixed tasks during uninfected and infected states using five
different rootkits. To characterize the power consumption profiles, we use both
simple statistical and novel, sophisticated features. We test a one-class
anomaly detection ensemble (that baselines non-infected power profiles) and
several kernel-based SVM classifiers (that train on both uninfected and
infected profiles) in detecting previously unseen malware and clean profiles.
The anomaly detection system exhibits perfect detection when using all features
and tasks, with smaller false detection rate than the supervised classifiers.
The primary contribution is the proof of concept that baselining power of fixed
tasks can provide accurate detection of rootkits. Moreover, our treatment
presents engineering hurdles needed for experimentation and allows analysis of
each statistical feature individually. This work appears to be the first step
towards a viable power-based detection capability for general-purpose
computers, and presents next steps toward this goal.

sleep disorders. This work proposes a joint classification-and-prediction
framework based on CNNs for automatic sleep staging, and, subsequently,
introduces a simple yet efficient CNN architecture to power the framework.
Given a single input epoch, the novel framework jointly determines its label
(classification) and its neighboring epochs' labels (prediction) in the
contextual output. While the proposed framework is orthogonal to the widely
adopted classification schemes, which take one or multiple epochs as contextual
inputs and produce a single classification decision on the target epoch, we
demonstrate its advantages in several ways. First, it leverages the dependency
among consecutive sleep epochs while surpassing the problems experienced with
the common classification schemes. Second, even with a single model, the
framework has the capacity to produce multiple decisions, which are essential
in obtaining a good performance as in ensemble-of-models methods, with very
little induced computational overhead. Probabilistic aggregation techniques are
then proposed to leverage the availability of multiple decisions. We conducted
experiments on two public datasets: Sleep-EDF Expanded with 20 subjects, and
Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies dataset with 200 subjects. The proposed
framework yields an overall classification accuracy of 82.3% and 83.6%,
respectively. We also show that the proposed framework not only is superior to
the baselines based on the common classification schemes but also outperforms
existing deep-learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work
going beyond the standard single-output classification to consider multitask
neural networks for automatic sleep staging. This framework provides avenues
for further studies of different neural-network architectures for automatic
sleep staging.

sidelink broadcast vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Harnessing
available information on the geographical position of vehicles and spectrum
resources utilization, eNodeBs are capable of allotting the same set of
sidelink resources to several different vehicles in order for them to broadcast
their signals. Hence, vehicles sharing the same resources would ideally be in
different communications clusters for the interference level-generated due to
resource repurposing-to be maintained under control. Within a communications
cluster, it is crucial that vehicles transmit in orthogonal time resources to
prevent conflicts as vehicles-with half-duplex radio interfaces--cannot
transmit and receive simultaneously. In this research, we have envisaged a
solution based on a bipartite graph, where vehicles and spectrum resources are
represented by vertices whereas the edges represent the achievable rate in each
resource based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) that
vehicles perceive. The aforementioned constraint on time orthogonality of
allocated resources can be approached by aggregating conflicting vertices into
macro-vertices which, in addition, narrows the search space yielding a solution
with computational complexity equivalent to the conventional graph matching
problem. We show mathematically and through simulations that the proposed
approach yields an optimal solution. In addition, we provide simulations
showing that the proposed method outperforms other competing approaches,
specially in scenarios with high vehicular density.

continue over the next decade. As a result, parallel-in-time methods,
mathematical formulations which exploit additional degrees of parallelism in
the time dimension, have gained increasing interest in recent years. In this
work we study a massively parallel rational approximation of exponential
integrators (REXI). This method replaces a time integration of stiff linear
oscillatory and diffusive systems by the sum of the solutions of many decoupled
systems, which can be solved in parallel. Previous numerical studies showed
that this reformulation allows taking arbitrarily long time steps for the
linear oscillatory parts.
  The present work studies the non-linear shallow-water equations on the
rotating sphere, a simplified system of equations used to study properties of
space and time discretization methods in the context of atmospheric
simulations. After introducing time integrators, we first compare the time step
sizes to the errors in the simulation, discussing pros and cons of different
formulations of REXI. Here, REXI already shows superior properties compared to
explicit and implicit time stepping methods. Additionally, we present
wallclock-time-to-error results revealing the sweet spots of REXI obtaining
either an over 6x higher accuracy within the same time frame or an about 3x
reduced time-to-solution for a similar error threshold. Our results motivate
further explorations of REXI for operational weather/climate systems.

the $b_1(1235)$ meson. In order to explain the violation of the vector meson
dominance hypothesis in this decay process, we investigate a model where the
$b_1$ meson strongly couples with the local current in tensor bilinear
representation. The tensor representation is investigated in the framework of
the operator product expansion and we found a low energy decay process that
does not follow the usual vector meson dominance hypothesis. The $\omega$-like
intermediate meson state of quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC}) = 0^{-}(1^{--})$ is
found to have a nontrivial role in the decay process of the $b_1$ meson. The
spectral structure of the $\omega$-like state is found to be close to a
$\pi$-$\rho$ hybrid state, which provides a mechanism that evades the usual
vector meson dominance hypothesis. Precise measurements of various decay
channels of the $b_1$ meson are, therefore, required to unravel the internal
structure of axial vector mesons.

experts to express probabilistic models and inference algorithms without
worrying about irrelevant details. However, for decades there remained an
important and popular class of probabilistic inference algorithms whose
efficient implementation required manual low-level coding that is tedious and
error-prone. They are algorithms whose idiomatic expression requires random
array variables that are latent or whose likelihood is conjugate. Although that
is how practitioners communicate and compose these algorithms on paper,
executing such expressions requires eliminating the latent variables and
recognizing the conjugacy by symbolic mathematics. Moreover, matching the
performance of handwritten code requires speeding up loops by more than a
constant factor.
  We show how probabilistic programs that directly and concisely express these
desired inference algorithms can be compiled while maintaining efficiency. We
introduce new transformations that turn high-level probabilistic programs with

invariants and norms to optimize the code, and to specialize and JIT-compile
the code per execution. The resulting performance is competitive with manual
implementations.

magnetization values associated with a spin ice for all orientations; shape
anisotropy is apparent when comparing in and out-of-plane directions.
Significantly, only the (110) oriented films display the hallmark spin ice
plateau state in magnetization, albeit less well-defined compared to the
plateau observed in a single crystal. Neutron scattering maps on the more
disordered (111) oriented films show the Q=0 phase previously observed in bulk

conclude that the spin ice physics in thin films is modified by defects and

potentially valuable probe of the mechanisms that trigger and provide fuel for
accretion onto supermassive black holes. While the correlation between AGN
fraction and environment has been well-studied in the local universe, AGN
fractions have been measured for relatively few dense environments at high
redshift. In this paper we present a measurement of the X-ray AGN fraction in
the USS 1558-003 protocluster associated with the z=2.53 radio galaxy 4C-00.62.
Our measurement is based on a 100ks Chandra observation, follow-up spectroscopy
from the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope, and
broad and narrow band photometry. These data are sensitive to AGN more luminous
than $L_{X}>2\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the rest-frame hard X-ray band
(2-10 keV). We have identified two X-ray AGN at the redshift of USS 1558-003,
one of which is the radio galaxy. We have determined that $2.0^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$%
of the H$\alpha$ emitters in the protocluster are X-ray AGN. Unlike most other
high-redshift cluster progenitors studied with similar techniques, USS 1558-003
does not have a significantly higher fraction of AGN than field galaxies at
similar redshifts. This lower AGN fraction is inconsistent with the expectation
that the higher gas fractions at high redshift, combined with the high galaxy
densities and modest relative velocities in protoclusters, should produce
higher AGN fractions.

wells has long been made either with a model for perfectly confined aquifers or
with a model for purely unconfined aquifers. However, many aquifers may be
neither totally confined nor purely unconfined at the frequencies of tidal
loading but behave somewhere between the two end members. Here we present a
more general model for the tidal response of groundwater in aquifers with both
horizontal and vertical flow. The model has three independent parameters: the
transmissivity and storativity of the aquifer and the specific leakage of the
leaking aquitard. If transmissivity and storativity are known independently,
this model may be used to estimate aquitard leakage from the phase shift and
amplitude ratio of water level in wells obtained from tidal analysis. We apply
the model to interpret the tidal response of water level in a USGS deep
monitoring well installed in the Arbuckle aquifer in Oklahoma, into which
massive amount of wastewater co-produced from hydrocarbon exploration has been
injected. The analysis shows that the Arbuckle aquifer is leaking significantly
at this site. We suggest that the present method may be effectively and
economically applied to monitor leakage in groundwater systems, which bears on
the safety of water resources, the security of underground waste repositories,
and the outflow of wastewater during deep injection and hydrocarbon extraction.

theory via spline functions and operators. Our key result is that a large class
of DNs can be written as a composition of max-affine spline operators (MASOs),
which provide a powerful portal through which to view and analyze their inner
workings. For instance, conditioned on the input signal, the output of a MASO
DN can be written as a simple affine transformation of the input. This implies
that a DN constructs a set of signal-dependent, class-specific templates
against which the signal is compared via a simple inner product; we explore the
links to the classical theory of optimal classification via matched filters and
the effects of data memorization. Going further, we propose a simple penalty
term that can be added to the cost function of any DN learning algorithm to
force the templates to be orthogonal with each other; this leads to
significantly improved classification performance and reduced overfitting with
no change to the DN architecture. The spline partition of the input signal
space that is implicitly induced by a MASO directly links DNs to the theory of
vector quantization (VQ) and $K$-means clustering, which opens up new geometric
avenue to study how DNs organize signals in a hierarchical fashion. To validate
the utility of the VQ interpretation, we develop and validate a new distance

basic idea of our method is to learn a unitary operation $\hat{U}$ that
transforms a given unknown state $|\psi_\tau\rangle$ to a known fiducial state
$|f\rangle$. Then, after completion of the learning process, we can estimate
and reproduce $|\psi_\tau\rangle$ based on the learned $\hat{U}$ and
$|f\rangle$. To realize this idea, we cast a random-based learning algorithm,
called `single-shot measurement learning,' in which the learning rule is based
on an intuitive and reasonable criterion: the greater the number of success (or
failure), the less (or more) changes are imposed. Remarkably, the learning
process occurs by means of a single-shot measurement outcome. We demonstrate
that our method works effectively, i.e., the learning is completed with a {\em
finite} number, say $N$, of unknown-state copies. Most surprisingly, our method
allows the maximum statistical accuracy to be achieved for large $N$, namely
$\simeq O(N^{-1})$ scales of average infidelity. This result is comparable to
those yielded from the standard quantum tomographic method in the case where
additional information is available. It highlights a non-trivial message, that
is, a random-based adaptive strategy can potentially be as accurate as other
standard statistical approaches.

both the Brewster effect and surface-plasmon-mediated absorption on planar
interfaces are limited to one polarization of the incident light and oblique
excitation angles, and may have limited bandwidth dictated by the material
dielectric index and plasma frequency. To alleviate these limitations, we
design narrow-band super-absorbers composed of plasmonic materials embedded
into dielectric photonic nanostructures with topologically-protected
interfacial Tamm plasmon states. These structures have planar geometry and do
not require nanopatterning to achieve perfect absorption of both polarizations
of the incident light in a wide range of incident angles, including the normal

range via engineering of the photon bandstructure of the dielectric photonic
nanostructures to achieve reversal of the geometrical phase across the

achieve perfect absorptance in Tamm structures with dissipative losses via
conjugate impedance matching. We further demonstrate via modeling how these

be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations: carefully crafted small
perturbations can cause misclassification of legitimate images. We propose
Defense-GAN, a new framework leveraging the expressive capability of generative
models to defend deep neural networks against such attacks. Defense-GAN is
trained to model the distribution of unperturbed images. At inference time, it
finds a close output to a given image which does not contain the adversarial
changes. This output is then fed to the classifier. Our proposed method can be
used with any classification model and does not modify the classifier structure
or training procedure. It can also be used as a defense against any attack as
it does not assume knowledge of the process for generating the adversarial
examples. We empirically show that Defense-GAN is consistently effective
against different attack methods and improves on existing defense strategies.

integrators impose inefficiencies for time-accurate calculations by requiring
that all meshes advance with the smallest timestep. With the targeted use of
multi-rate time integrators, separate meshes can be time-marched at independent

This work applies time-explicit multi-rate integrators to the simulation of the

hydrodynamics simulations that include non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry,
individual star formation, stellar feedback and metal enrichment. Clustered SNe
lead to the formation of superbubbles which break out of the disk and vent out
hot gas, launching the winds. We find much weaker winds than what cosmological
simulations typically adopt at this mass scale. At the virial radius, the
time-averaged loading factors of mass, momentum and energy are 3, 1 and 0.05,
respectively, and the metal enrichment factor is 1.5. Winds that escape the
halo consist of two populations that differ in their launching temperatures.
Hot gas acquires enough kinetic energy to escape when launched while warm gas
does not. However, warm gas can be further accelerated by the ram pressure of
the subsequently launched hot gas and eventually escape. The strong
interactions between different temperature phases highlight the caveat of
extrapolating properties of warm gas to large distances based on its local
conditions (e.g. the Bernoulli parameter). Our convergence study finds that
wind properties converge when the cooling masses of individual SNe are
resolved, which corresponds to $m_{\rm gas}=5 {\rm M_\odot}$ with an injection
mass of $500 {\rm M_\odot}$. The winds weaken dramatically once the SNe become
unresolved. We demonstrate that injecting the terminal momentum of SNe, a
popular sub-grid model in the literature, fails to capture SN winds
irrespective of the inclusion of residual thermal energy.

The compilation is selected from three galaxy-scale strong-lens samples
including the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Emission-Line Lens
Survey (BELLS), BELLS for GALaxy-Ly$\alpha$ EmitteR sYstems Survey, and Strong

significant ensemble of massive ETGs for which robust mass measurements can be
achieved within a broad range of Einstein radii up to three effective radii.
Characterizing the three-dimensional total mass-density distribution by a

diseases such as glaucoma, pathological myopia, age-related macular
degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. With the development of computer
science, computer aided diagnosis has been developed to process and analyse the
retinal images automatically. One of the challenges in the analysis is that the
quality of the retinal image is often degraded. For example, a cataract in
human lens will attenuate the retinal image, just as a cloudy camera lens which
reduces the quality of a photograph. It often obscures the details in the
retinal images and posts challenges in retinal image processing and analysing
tasks. In this paper, we approximate the degradation of the retinal images as a
combination of human-lens attenuation and scattering. A novel
structure-preserving guided retinal image filtering (SGRIF) is then proposed to
restore images based on the attenuation and scattering model. The proposed
SGRIF consists of a step of global structure transferring and a step of global
edge-preserving smoothing. Our results show that the proposed SGRIF method is
able to improve the contrast of retinal images, measured by histogram flatness
measure, histogram spread and variability of local luminosity. In addition, we
further explored the benefits of SGRIF for subsequent retinal image processing
and analysing tasks. In the two applications of deep learning based optic cup

results show that we are able to achieve more accurate optic cup segmentation

However, OE learns a deterministic knowledge base, limiting expressiveness of

the ability to perform rich joint and conditional queries over arbitrary sets

robust preference model where the optimal decision is based on the worst-case
choice function from an ambiguity set constructed through preference

works in the area, our focus is on quasi-concave choice functions rather than
concave functions and this enables us to cover a wide range of utility/risk

aspirational risk preferences. The robust choice function is increasing and
quasi-concave but not necessarily translation invariant, a key property of
monetary risk measures. We propose two approaches based respectively on the
support functions and level functions of quasi-concave functions to develop
tractable formulations of the maximin preference robust optimization model. The
former gives rise to a mixed integer linear programming problem whereas the
latter is equivalent to solving a sequence of convex risk minimization
problems. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed robust preference
optimization model and numerical schemes, we apply them to a security budget

recently suggested in literature as pseudohyperbolic. The absence of tangencies
and thus the presence of the pseudohyperbolicity is verified using the method
of angles that includes computation of distributions of the angles between the
corresponding tangent subspaces. Also we analyze how volume expansion in the
first subspace and the contraction in the second one occurs locally. For this
purpose we introduce a family of instant Lyapunov exponents. Unlike the well
known finite time ones, the instant Lyapunov exponents show expansion or
contraction on infinitesimal time intervals. Two types of instant Lyapunov
exponents are defined. One is related to ordinary finite time Lyapunov
exponents computed in the course of standard algorithm for Lyapunov exponents.
Their sums reveal instant volume expanding properties. The second type of
instant Lyapunov exponents shows how covariant Lyapunov vectors grow or decay
on infinitesimal time. Using both instant and finite time Lyapunov exponents we
demonstrate that specific to the pseudohyperbolicity average expanding and
contracting properties are typically violated on infinitesimal time. Instantly
volumes from the first subspace can sometimes be contacted, directions in the
second subspace can sometimes be expanded, and the instant contraction in the
first subspace can sometimes be stronger than the contraction in the second
subspace.

nature, whereby a population of oscillating units, which have diverse natural

spontaneously exhibit collective oscillations at a common frequency. The
Kuramoto model provides the basic analytical framework to study spontaneous
synchronization. The model comprises limit-cycle oscillators with distributed
natural frequencies interacting through a mean-field coupling. Although more
than forty years have passed since its introduction, the model continues to
occupy the centre-stage of research in the field of non-linear dynamics, and is
also widely applied to model diverse physical situations. In this brief review,
starting with a derivation of the Kuramoto model and the synchronization
phenomenon it exhibits, we summarize recent results on the study of a
generalized Kuramoto model that includes inertial effects and stochastic noise.
We describe the dynamics of the generalized model from a different yet a rather
useful perspective, namely, that of long-range interacting systems driven out
of equilibrium by quenched disordered external torques. A system is said to be
long-range interacting if the inter-particle potential decays slowly as a
function of distance. Using tools of statistical physics, we highlight the
equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of the dynamics of the generalized
Kuramoto model, and uncover a rather rich and complex phase diagram that it
exhibits, which underlines the basic theme of intriguing emergent phenomena
that are exhibited by many-body complex systems.

with computed tomography scan and the reconstructed image was transferred to
pinnacle treatment planning system (TPS). On TPS the planning target volume

manually and a treatment plan was made. The dose constraints were determined
for the concerned organs according to IROC-H prescription. The treatment plan
was optimized using adoptive convolution algorithm to improve dose homogeneity
and conformity. The dose calculation was performed using C.C Convolution
algorithm and a Varian True Beam linear accelerator was used to deliver the
treatment plan to the head and neck phantom. The delivered radiation dose to
the phantom was measured through TLDs and GafChromic EBT2 films. The dosimetric
performance of the VMAT delivery was studied by analysing percent dose
difference, iso-dose line profile and gamma analysis of the TPS computed dose
and linac delivered doses.
  Result: the percent dose difference of 3.8\% was observed between the planned
and measured doses of TLDs and a 1.5mm distance to agreement (DTA) was observed
by comparing iso-dose line profiles. Passed the gamma criteria of 3\%/3 mm was
with good percentages.
  Conclusion: The dosimetric performance of VMAT delivery for a challenging

affective computing systems are advantageous for emotion assessment of
individuals in audio-video communication environments such as teleconferencing,
healthcare, and education. From a review of the literature, the use of eye gaze
features extracted from video is a modality that has remained largely
unexploited for continuous affect prediction. This work presents a review of
the literature within the emotion classification and continuous affect
prediction sub-fields of affective computing for both speech and eye gaze
modalities. Additionally, continuous affect prediction experiments using speech
and eye gaze modalities are presented. A baseline system is proposed using open

audio-visual corpus. Further system performance is assessed in a cross-corpus

an effective supportive modality for speech when used in a bimodal continuous
affect prediction system. The addition of eye gaze to speech in a simple
feature fusion framework yields a prediction improvement of 6.13% for valence

using medium resolution line-of-sight synoptic magnetograms from the magnetic
database of the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak (NSO/KP), USA for the
period between February 1975 and October 2017, covering solar cycles 21-24 and

Imager instrument onboard the Solar Heliospheric Observatory. Synoptic
magnetograms using radial measurements from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager
instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, covering solar cycle 23 and
24, were also used. Results: We show that the Southern solar hemisphere
unambiguously reversed polarity in mid-2013 while the reversal in the field in
the Northern solar hemisphere started as early as June 2012, was followed by a
sustained period of near-zero field strength lasting until the end of 2014,
after which the field began to show a clear rise from its near-zero value.
While this study compliments a similar study carried out using microwave
brightness measurements (Gopalswamy et al. 2016) which claimed that the field
reversal process in cycle 24 was completed by the end of 2015, our results show
that the field reversal in cycle 24 was completed earlier i.e. in late 2014.
Signatures of this unusual field reversal pattern were also clearly
identifiable in the solar wind, using our observations of interplanetary
scintillation at 327 MHz which supported our magnetic field observations and
confirmed that the field reversal process was completed at the end of 2014.

known to be computationally hard and is an example of combinatorial
optimization, which leads to the application of simple heuristics in practice.
In this paper, we propose an approach which uses a mix of Evolutionary
Strategies and Reinforcement Learning (RL) tech- niques to find an
approximation of the optimal solution. The RL based agent uses the Policy
Gradient method, an evolutionary reward strategy and a Pool of good
(not-optimal) solutions to find the approximation. We find that the RL agent
learns near-optimal solutions that outperforms the heuristic solutions. We also
observe that the RL agent assisted with a pool generalizes better for unseen
problems than an RL agent without a pool. We present our results on synthetic

terminal. The results validate that our approach does comparatively better than
the heuristics solutions available, and adapts to unseen problems better.

Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), and is quickly gaining ground for
wireless systems. Storing popular content at the edge of the network (e.g. at
small cells) is seen as a `win-win' for both the user (reduced access latency)
and the operator (reduced load on the transport network and core servers).
Nevertheless, the much smaller size of such edge caches, and the volatility of
user preferences suggest that standard caching methods do not suffice in this
context. What is more, simple popularity-based models commonly used (e.g. IRM)
are becoming outdated, as users often consume multiple contents in sequence
(e.g. YouTube, Spotify), and this consumption is driven by recommendation
systems. The latter presents a great opportunity to bias the recommender to
minimize content access cost (e.g. maximizing cache hit rates). To this end, in
this paper we first propose a Markovian model for recommendation-driven user
requests. We then formulate the problem of biasing the recommendation algorithm
to minimize access cost, while maintaining acceptable recommendation quality.
We show that the problem is non-convex, and propose an iterative ADMM-based
algorithm that outperforms existing schemes, and shows significant potential
for performance improvement on real content datasets.

between magnetism and ferroelectric polarisation in the parent $Pm\bar{3}m$
perovskite structure. We show that third order magnetoelectric coupling terms
must always involve magnetic ordering at the A and B-site which either
transforms both as R-point or both as X-point time odd irreducible
representations (irreps). For fourth order couplings we demonstrate that this
criterion may be relaxed allowing couplings involving irreps at X, M and
R-points which collectively conserve crystal momentum, producing a
magnetoelectric effect arising from only B-site magnetic order. In this case,
exactly two of the three irreps entering the order parameter must be time-odd
irreps and either one or all must be even with respect to inversion symmetry.
We are able to show that the time-even irreps in this triad must transform as
one of: X$_{1}^{-}$, M$_{3,5}^{-}$ and R$_{5}^{+}$, corresponding to A-site
cation order, A-site anti-polar displacements or anion rock-salt ordering. This
greatly reduces the search-space for (type-II multiferroic) perovskites. We use
similar arguments to demonstrate how weak ferromagnetism may be engineered, and
we propose a variety of schemes for coupling this to ferroelectric
polarisation. We illustrate our approach with DFT calculations on
magnetoelectric couplings, and by considering the literature we suggest which
avenues of research are likely to be most promising in the design of novel

altered and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat
indoor objects, allowing fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or

model-free distances to the host galaxy of one or more gamma-ray burst

relationship by employing them as cosmological probes. In the first part of a
two-paper analysis, I present my method for deriving the dilution factors of
the SE-SN sample, which were chosen on the basis that
cosmological-model-independent distances exist to their host galaxies, and each
has a sufficient dataset that allows for host-subtracted, dereddened rest-frame
$BVI$ LCs to be constructed, and time-series spectra. A Planck function was fit
to the data to derive the blackbody radius and blackbody temperature as a
function of time, while the blueshifted velocity of either Si II $\lambda$6355
or Fe II $\lambda$5169 was used a proxy of the photospheric velocity, and hence
photospheric radius. The ratio of these empirically derived radii was taken as
the dilution/correct factor. I then compared the empirically derived dilution
factors with synthetic values obtained from radiative transfer models
calculated for SE-SNe arising from binary systems. It is seen that the
empirical dilution factors of the SNe Ic and GRB-SNe, the latter which were
derived based on luminosity distances calculated from their spectroscopic
redshift, are very similar. It is found that the dilution factors of the two
relativistic SN IcBL are very different to those of the GRB-SNe, meaning that
these engine-driven events may arise from fundamentally different progenitor

the primitivity process in the setting of a two-player probabilistic game and
we make use of convex optimization techniques to describe its behavior. We
develop a tool for approximating and upper bounding the exponent of any

degree of freedom in addition to charge and spin. In the absence of inversion
symmetry, these systems were predicted to exhibit opposite Hall effects for
electrons from different valleys. Such valley Hall effects have been achieved
only by extrinsic means, such as substrate coupling, dual gating, and light
illuminating. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic valley Hall
transport without any extrinsic symmetry breaking in the non-centrosymmetric
monolayer and trilayer MoS2, evidenced by considerable nonlocal resistance that
scales cubically with local resistance. Such a hallmark survives even at room
temperature with a valley diffusion length at micron scale. By contrast, no
valley Hall signal is observed in the centrosymmetric bilayer MoS2. Our work
elucidates the topological quantum origin of valley Hall effects and marks a
significant step towards the purely electrical control of valley degree of

defined as $w(i) = \max_{v \in S_i} w(v)$ and the weight of a coloring $c$ as
$w(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}w(i)$. Guan and Zhu [Inf. Process. Lett., 1997] defined
the weighted chromatic number of a pair $(G,w)$, denoted by $\sigma(G,w)$, as
the minimum weight of a proper coloring of $G$. The problem of determining
$\sigma(G,w)$ has received considerable attention during the last years, and
has been proved to be notoriously hard: for instance, it is NP-hard on split
graphs, unsolvable on $n$-vertex trees in time $n^{o(\log n)}$ unless the ETH
fails, and W[1]-hard on forests parameterized by the size of a largest tree. In
this article we provide some positive results for the problem, by considering
its so-called dual parameterization: given a vertex-weighted graph $(G,w)$ and
an integer $k$, the question is whether $\sigma(G,w) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)}
w(v) - k$. We prove that this problem is FPT by providing an algorithm running
in time $9^k \cdot n^{O(1)}$, and it is easy to see that no algorithm in time
$2^{o(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ exists under the ETH. On the other hand, we present a
kernel with at most $(2^{k-1}+1) (k-1)$ vertices, and we rule out the existence
of polynomial kernels unless ${\sf NP} \subseteq {\sf coNP} / {\sf poly}$, even
on split graphs with only two different weights. Finally, we identify some
classes of graphs on which the problem admits a polynomial kernel, in
particular interval graphs and subclasses of split graphs, and in the latter

problem of solving word equations is decidable, the decidability of the problem
of solving a word equation with a length constraint (i.e., a constraint
relating the lengths of words in the word equation) has remained a
long-standing open problem. In this paper, we focus on the subclass of
quadratic word equations, i.e., in which each variable occurs at most twice. We
first show that the length abstractions of solutions to quadratic word
equations are in general not Presburger-definable. We then describe a class of
counter systems with Presburger transition relations which capture the length
abstraction of a quadratic word equation with regular constraints. We provide
an encoding of the effect of a simple loop of the counter systems in the theory
of existential Presburger Arithmetic with divisibility (PAD). Since PAD is
decidable, we get a decision procedure for quadratic words equations with
length constraints for which the associated counter system is \emph{flat}
(i.e., all nodes belong to at most one cycle). We show a decidability result
(in fact, also an NP algorithm with a PAD oracle) for a recently proposed
NP-complete fragment of word equations called regular-oriented word equations,
together with length constraints. Decidability holds when the constraints are

particularly interesting possibilities. We present a new method to determine
the electroweak penguin parameters, which uses an isospin relation and requires
only minimal $SU(3)$ input. We apply it to the current data for $B\to\pi K$
decays and discuss the prospects for utilizing CP violation in
$B^0_d\to\pi^0K_{\rm S}$. The strategy has the exciting potential to establish
New Physics in the electroweak penguin sector in the high-precision era of
$B$-physics.

Gabidulin codes. The parametrization we get for the non-systematic part of this
matrix coincides with the $q$-analogue of generalized Cauchy matrices, leading
to the definition of $q$-Cauchy matrices. These matrices can be represented
very conveniently and their representation allows to define new interesting
subfamilies of generalized Gabidulin codes whose generator matrix is a
structured matrix. In particular, as an application, we construct Gabidulin
codes whose generator matrix is the concatenation of an identity block and a
Toeplitz/Hankel matrix. In addition, our results allow to give a new efficient
criterion to verify whether a rank metric code of dimension $k$ and length $n$
is a generalized Gabidulin code. This criterion is only based on the
computation of the rank of one matrix and on the verification of the linear
independence of two sets of elements and it requires $\mathcal O(m\cdot
F(k,n))$ field operations, where $F(k,n)$ is the cost of computing the reduced

surface in two dimensional geometry. We find that the increase of propelling
force leads to and enhances inhomogeneous accumulation of ABPs inside the brush
region. Oscillation of chain bundles (beating like cilia) is found in company
with the formation and disassembly of dynamic cluster of ABPs at large
propelling forces. Meanwhile chains are stretched and pushed down due to the
effective shear force by ABPs. The decrease of the average brush thickness with
propelling force reflects the growth of the beating amplitude of chain bundles.
Furthermore, the beating phenomenon is investigated in a simple single-chain
system. We find that the chain swings regularly with a major oscillatory
period, which increases with chain length and decreases with the increase of
propelling force. We build a theory to describe the phenomenon and the
predictions on the relationship between period and amplitude for various chain
lengths and propelling forces agree very well with simulation data.

performed using the SCORPIO-2 focal reducer mounted in the prime focus of the
6-m BTA telescope (SAO RAS, Russia). We analyse the B, V and R-band images to
describe the dusty cometary coma and to investigate its brightness, colours and
dust production rate. The spectra cover the wavelength range of 3600\div 7070
\AA. No emissions which are expected in this wavelength region were detected
above the 3$\sigma$ level. The continuum shows a reddening effect with the
normalized gradient of reflectivity along dispersion of (9.3$\pm$1.1)% per 1000
\AA. A dust-loss rate was derived using the obtained values and under the
different model assumptions. Our simulations clearly indicate that to retrieve
dust production from the observational Af$\rho$ parameter is an ambiguous task.
The result of such a procedure is strongly dependent on dynamical (e.g.
effective density and cross-section) as well as optical (e.g. scattering
coefficient and phase function) characteristics of dust grains. A variation of
the mentioned parameters can lead to dramatic changes in the evaluation of mass
production. We demonstrate that the dynamic and optical properties are

parameters may not be uniformly valid; there is no finite-sample size at which

problem is exacerbated in high-dimensional settings, where variable selection
becomes unavoidable. This has prompted a flurry of activity in developing
uniformly valid hypothesis tests for a low-dimensional regression parameter
(e.g. the causal effect of an exposure A on an outcome Y) in high-dimensional
models. So far there has been limited focus on model misspecification, although
this is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. We propose tests of the null
that are uniformly valid under sparsity conditions weaker than those typically
invoked in the literature, assuming working models for the exposure and outcome
are both correctly specified. When one of the models is misspecified, by
amending the procedure for estimating the nuisance parameters, our tests
continue to be valid; hence they are doubly robust. Our proposals are
straightforward to implement using existing software for penalized maximum
likelihood estimation and do not require sample-splitting. We illustrate them
in simulations and an analysis of data obtained from the Ghent University

determination of the normal from the abnormal when datasets are highly biased
towards one class (normal) due to the insufficient sample size of the other
class (abnormal). While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem,
a significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the
unknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a
one-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly
detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that
jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference
of latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the
generator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension
vector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use
of the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent
representation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent
vectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal
samples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data
distribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that
distribution - an anomaly. Experimentation over several benchmark datasets,
from varying domains, shows the model efficacy and superiority over previous
state-of-the-art approaches.

its tractability when the constraint function is affine in both the decision

inflation with a quasi-inflection point in the potential. In these models, a
large production of PBHs requires a deviation from the slow-roll (SR)

quantum fluctuations. We study the back-reaction of these quantum modes on the
inflationary dynamics using stochastic inflation in the Hamilton-Jacobi
formalism. We develop a methodology to solve quantum diffusion beyond SR in
terms of the statistical moments of the probability distribution. We apply
these techniques to a toy model potential with a quasi-inflection point. We
find that there is an enhancement of the power spectrum due to the dominance of
the stochastic noise in the phase beyond SR. Moreover, non-Gaussian corrections
become as well relevant with a large positive kurtosis. Altogether, this
produces a significant boost of PBH production. We discuss how our results
extend to other single-field models with similar dynamics. We conclude that the
abundance of PBHs in this class of models should be revisited including quantum
diffusion.

new structures and criteria, one of them having a significant overlap with the

$\beta$-reduction with infinitely many `$\bot$-rules', which contract

eliminate foreground objects. A subsequence with stable illumination condition
is first selected for background estimation. Images are segmented into
superpixels to preserve spatial texture information and foreground objects are
eliminated by superpixel motion filtering process. A low-complexity
density-based clustering is then performed to generate reliable background
candidates for final background determination. The approach has been evaluated
on SBMnet dataset and it achieves a performance superior or comparable to other

of magnitude (from picoseconds to order of a second), in systems large enough
to avoid finite-size effects. We find that the time-growth of the size of the
glassy domains is excellently described by a single scaling function. A single
time-scale $\tau(T)$ controls the dynamics. $\tau(T)$ diverges upon approaching
the $T=0$ critical point. The divergence of $\tau(T\to 0)$ is Arrhenius-like,
with a barrier height that depends very mildly on temperature. The growth of
this barrier-height is best described by critical dynamics. As a side product
we obtain an impressive confirmation of universality of the equilibrium
behavior of two-dimensional spin-glasses.

structures made by pairwise interactions (links) of elements (nodes). For many

than two elements, and simplicial complexes are more adequate to describe such

propose a framework to model such an evolution: the Simplicial Activity Driven
(SAD) model, in which the building block is a simplex of nodes representing a
multi-agent interaction. We show analytically and numerically that the use of
simplicial structures leads to crucial differences in the outcome of
paradigmatic processes modelling disease propagation or social contagion, with
respect to the activity-driven (AD) model, a paradigmatic temporal network
model involving only binary interactions. In particular, fluctuations in the
number of nodes involved in the interactions can affect the outcome of models
of simple contagion processes, contrarily to what happens in the AD model.
Moreover, social contagion models such as cascading processes present a much
richer phenomenology and can become extremely slow when occurring on evolving
simplicial complexes.

found to be independent from one another. Firstly, the spectrum undergoes a
smooth transition from a soft to a hard spectrum. Secondly, the spectrum
displays more rapid variability seemingly confined to a very narrow energy band
(~ 1-3 keV). Three physical models (blurred reflection, partial covering, and
soft Comptonisation) were explored to characterise the average spectrum of the
observation as well as the spectral state change. All three models were found
to fit the average spectrum and the spectral changes equally well. The more
rapid variability appears as two cycles of a sinusoidal function, but we cannot
attribute this to periodic variability. The Fe K-alpha band exhibits a narrow
6.4 keV emission line consistent with an origin from the distant torus. In
addition, features blueward of the neutral iron line are consistent with
emission from He-like and H-like iron that could be originating from the highly
ionised layer of the torus, but a broad Gaussian profile at ~ 6.7 keV also fits

  and applying it to quantum coherence","6 Pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The uncertainty principle sets limit on our ability to predict the values of
two incompatible observables measured on a quantum particle simultaneously.
This principle can be stated in various forms. In quantum information theory,
it is expressed in terms of the entropic measures. Uncertainty bound can be
altered by considering a particle as a quantum memory correlating with the
primary particle. In this work, we provide a method for converting the entropic
uncertainty relation in the absence of quantum memory to that in its presence.
It is shown that the lower bounds obtained through the method are tighter than
those having been achieved so far. The method is also used to obtain the
uncertainty relations for multiple measurements in the presence of quantum
memory. Also for a given state, the lower bounds on the sum of the relative
entropies of unilateral coherences are provided using the uncertainty relations
in the presence of quantum memory, and it is shown which one is tighter.

  Optimization for Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper we explore acceleration techniques for large scale nonconvex
optimization problems with special focuses on deep neural networks. The
extrapolation scheme is a classical approach for accelerating stochastic
gradient descent for convex optimization, but it does not work well for
nonconvex optimization typically. Alternatively, we propose an interpolation
scheme to accelerate nonconvex optimization and call the method Interpolatron.
We explain motivation behind Interpolatron and conduct a thorough empirical
analysis. Empirical results on DNNs of great depths (e.g., 98-layer ResNet and
200-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that Interpolatron can converge
much faster than the state-of-the-art methods such as the SGD with momentum and
Adam. Furthermore, Anderson's acceleration, in which mixing coefficients are
computed by least-squares estimation, can also be used to improve the
performance. Both Interpolatron and Anderson's acceleration are easy to
implement and tune. We also show that Interpolatron has linear convergence rate
under certain regularity assumptions.

computing resource comes to a critical problem, especially as the growth of
Industry 4.0 and Industry Internet of Things. However, against traditional
single pattern matching model, a pattern may contain multiple subpatterns
representing different physical meanings in the real world. Hence, we formulate
a new problem, called ""consecutive subpatterns matching"", which allows users to
specify a pattern containing several consecutive subpatterns with various
specified thresholds. We propose a novel representation Equal-Length Block
(ELB) together with two efficient implementations, which work very well under
all Lp-Norms without false dismissals. Extensive experiments are performed on
synthetic and real-world datasets to illustrate that our approach outperforms
the brute-force method and MSM, a multi-step filter mechanism over the
multi-scaled representation by orders of magnitude.

material, the reflected light undergoes a polarization rotation. This
magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) has been intensively studied in a variety of
ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials because it provides a powerful probe for
electronic and magnetic properties as well as for various applications
including magneto-optical recording. Recently, there has been a surge of
interest in antiferromagnets (AFMs) as prospective spintronic materials for
high-density and ultrafast memory devices, owing to their vanishingly small
stray field and orders of magnitude faster spin dynamics compared to their
ferromagnetic counterparts. In fact, the MOKE has proven useful for the study
and application of the antiferromagnetic (AF) state. Although limited to
insulators, certain types of AFMs are known to exhibit a large MOKE, as they
are weak ferromagnets due to canting of the otherwise collinear spin structure.
Here we report the first observation of a large MOKE signal in an AF metal at
room temperature. In particular, we find that despite a vanishingly small
magnetization of $M \sim$0.002 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Mn, the non-collinear AF metal
Mn$_3$Sn exhibits a large zero-field MOKE with a polar Kerr rotation angle of
20 milli-degrees, comparable to ferromagnetic metals. Our first-principles
calculations have clarified that ferroic ordering of magnetic octupoles in the
non-collinear Neel state may cause a large MOKE even in its fully compensated
AF state without spin magnetization. This large MOKE further allows imaging of
the magnetic octupole domains and their reversal induced by magnetic field. The
observation of a large MOKE in an AF metal should open new avenues for the
study of domain dynamics as well as spintronics using AFMs.

in recent years with the use of plasmonics. Here, many types of nanophotonic
devices and applications have been suggested that take advantage of quantum
optical effects, despite the inherent presence of loss. A key example is
quantum plasmonic sensing, which provides sensitivity beyond the classical
limit using entangled N00N states and their generalizations in a compact system
operating below the diffraction limit. In this work, we experimentally
demonstrate the excitation and propagation of a two-plasmon entangled N00N
state (N=2) in a silver nanowire, and assess the performance of our system for
carrying out quantum sensing. Polarization entangled photon pairs are converted
into plasmons in the silver nanowire, which propagate over a distance of 5 um
and re-convert back into photons. A full analysis of the plasmonic system finds
that the high-quality entanglement is preserved throughout. We measure the
characteristic super-resolution phase oscillations of the entangled state via
coincidence measurements. We also identify various sources of loss in our setup
and show how they can be mitigated, in principle, in order to reach
super-sensitivity that goes beyond the classical sensing limit. Our results
show that polarization entanglement can be preserved in a plasmonic nanowire
and that sensing with a quantum advantage is possible with moderate loss
present.

multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, or CPS-OFDM for short, is proposed in this paper.
CPS-OFDM, characterized by user-specific precoder flexibility, possesses the
advantages of both low out-of-subband emission (OSBE) and low peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR), which are two major desired physical layer signal
properties for various scenarios in 5G New Radio (NR), including fragmented
spectrum access, new types of user equipments (UEs), and communications at high
carrier frequencies. As opposed to most of existing waveform candidates using
windowing or filtering techniques, CPS-OFDM prevents block extension that
causes extra inter-block interference (IBI) and envelope fluctuation unfriendly
to signal reception and power amplifier (PA) efficiency, respectively. An
optimization problem of the prototype shaping vector built in the CPS precoder
is formulated to minimize the variance of instantaneous power (VIP) with
controllable OSBE power (OSBEP) and noise enhancement penalty (NEP). In order
to solve the optimization problem involving a quartic objective function, the
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithmic framework is exploited. By proving
the convexity of the proposed problem, the globally optimal solution invariant
of coming data is guaranteed to be attained via numbers of iterations.
Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme in terms
of detection reliability and spectral efficiency for practical 5G cases such as
asynchronous transmissions and mixed numerologies.

influence, on rheological properties, of solvent-mediated friction from that of
a dissipative mechanism that is independent of solvent viscosity. In
particular, hydrodynamic interactions have a significant influence on the
magnitude of the stress jump at the inception of shear flow, and on the
transient viscometric functions, but a negligible effect on the steady state
viscometric functions at high shear rates. Zero-shear rate viscometric
functions of free-draining dumbbells remain essentially independent of the
internal viscosity parameter, as predicted by the Gaussian approximation, but
the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions induces a dependence on both the
hydrodynamic interaction and the internal viscosity parameter. Large values of
the internal viscosity parameter lead to linear viscoelastic predictions that
mimic the behavior of rigid dumbbell solutions. On the other hand, steady-shear
viscometric functions at high shear rates differ in general from those for
rigid dumbbells, depending crucially on the finite extensibility of the

moment dynamics of populations with nonlocal dispersal and competition in
continuous space. It is based on analytically solvable decompositions of the
time evolution operator for a coupled set of master equations. This has allowed
us -- for the first time in the literature -- to perform moment dynamics
simulations of spatially inhomogeneous systems beyond the mean-field approach
and to calculate the inhomogeneous pair correlation function using the Kirkwood
superposition ansatz. As a result, we revealed a number of new subtle effects,
possible in real populations. Namely, for systems with short-range dispersal
and mid-range competition, strong clustering of entities at small distances
followed by their deep disaggregation at larger separations are observed in the
wavefront of density propagation. For populations in which the competition
range is much shorter than that of dispersal, the pair correlation function
exhibits a long-tail behavior. Remarkably, the latter effect takes place only
due to the spatial inhomogeneity and thus was completely unknown before.
Moreover, both effects get stronger in the direction of propagation. All these
types of behavior are interpreted as a trade-off between the dispersal and
competition in the coexistence of reproductive pair correlations and the
inhomogeneity of the density of the system.

product types. They make it easy to focus on the salient parts of a data
structure in a composable and reusable manner.
  In this paper, we use the combination of lenses and traversals to give rise
to an expressive and flexible library for querying and modifying complex data
structures. Furthermore, since our lenses and traversals are based on the
generic shape of data, we are able to use this information to produce code that
is as efficient as hand-written versions. The technique leverages the structure
of data to produce generic abstractions that are then eliminated by the
standard workhorses of modern functional compilers: inlining and
specialisation.

Observations model fitting approach to measure galaxy shapes directly from
visibility data of radio continuum surveys, instead of from image data. We
apply a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) technique for sampling the posterior,
which is more efficient than the standard Monte Carlo Markov Chain method when
dealing with a large dimensional parameter space. Adopting the exponential
profile for galaxy model fitting allows us to analytically calculate the
likelihood gradient required by HMC, allowing a faster and more accurate
sampling. The method is tested on SKA1-MID simulated observations at 1.4 GHz of
a field containing up to 1000 star-forming galaxies. It is also applied to a
simulated observation of the weak lensing precursor survey SuperCLASS. In both
cases we obtain reliable measurements of the galaxies' ellipticity and size for
all sources with SNR $\ge 10$, and we also find relationships between the
convergence properties of the HMC technique and some source parameters. Direct
shape measurement in the visibility domain achieves high accuracy at the
expected source number densities of the current and next SKA precursor
continuum surveys. The proposed method can be easily extended for the fitting
of other galaxy and scientific parameters, as well as simultaneously
marginalising over systematic and instrumental effects.

model-based controller design technique for highly nonlinear systems, in the
presence of model and external uncertainties. However, the implementation of
the conventional continuous-time SMC on digital computers is limited, due to
the imprecisions caused by data sampling and quantization, and the chattering
phenomena, which results in high frequency oscillations. One effective solution
to minimize the effects of data sampling and quantization imprecisions is the
use of higher order sliding modes. To this end, in this paper, a new
formulation of an adaptive second order discrete sliding mode control (DSMC) is
presented for a general class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uncertain
nonlinear systems. Based on a Lyapunov stability argument and by invoking the
new Invariance Principle, not only the asymptotic stability of the controller
is guaranteed, but also the adaptation law is derived to remove the
uncertainties within the nonlinear plant dynamics. The proposed adaptive
tracking controller is designed and tested in real-time for a highly nonlinear
control problem in spark ignition combustion engine during transient operating
conditions. The simulation and real-time processor-in-the-loop (PIL) test
results show that the second order single-input single-output (SISO) DSMC can
improve the tracking performances up to 90%, compared to a first order SISO
DSMC under sampling and quantization imprecisions, in the presence of modeling
uncertainties. Moreover, it is observed that by converting the engine SISO
controllers to a MIMO structure, the overall controller performance can be
enhanced by 25%, compared to the SISO second order DSMC, because of the
dynamics coupling consideration within the MIMO DSMC formulation.

stochastic gradient method, has attracted much recent attention. The present
work applies stochastic optimisation to the task of recursive estimation of a
statistical parameter which belongs to a Riemannian manifold. Roughly, this
task amounts to stochastic minimisation of a statistical divergence function.
The following problem is considered : how to obtain fast, asymptotically
efficient, recursive estimates, using a Riemannian stochastic optimisation
algorithm with decreasing step sizes? In solving this problem, several original
results are introduced. First, without any convexity assumptions on the
divergence function, it is proved that, with an adequate choice of step sizes,
the algorithm computes recursive estimates which achieve a fast non-asymptotic
rate of convergence. Second, the asymptotic normality of these recursive
estimates is proved, by employing a novel linearisation technique. Third, it is
proved that, when the Fisher information metric is used to guide the algorithm,
these recursive estimates achieve an optimal asymptotic rate of convergence, in
the sense that they become asymptotically efficient. These results, while
relatively familiar in the Euclidean context, are here formulated and proved
for the first time, in the Riemannian context. In addition, they are
illustrated with a numerical application to the recursive estimation of
elliptically contoured distributions.

applied to filter out this high-frequency noise (the filter has been chosen in

LCP array for a collection of sequences. Our algorithm takes the amount of
available memory as an input parameter, and tries to make the best use of it by
splitting the input collection into subcollections sufficiently small that it
can compute their BWT in RAM using an optimal linear time algorithm. Next, it
merges the partial BWTs in external memory and in the process it also computes
the LCP values. We prove that our algorithm performs O(n AveLcp) sequential
I/Os, where n is the total length of the collection, and AveLcp is the average
Longest Common Prefix of the collection. This bound is an improvement over the
known algorithms for the same task. The experimental results show that our
algorithm outperforms the current best algorithm for collections of sequences
with different lengths and for collections with relatively small average
Longest Common Prefix.
  In the second part of the paper, we show that our algorithm can be modified
to output two additional arrays that, used with the BWT and LCP arrays, provide
simple, scan based, external memory algorithms for three well known problems in
bioinformatics: the computation of maximal repeats, the all pairs suffix-prefix
overlaps, and the construction of succinct de Bruijn graphs. To our knowledge,
there are no other known external memory algorithms for these problems.

with new insights as to the ability of neural networks to both memorize the

the ideal estimator that perfectly memorizes the data. We show that
memorization of non-generalizing networks happens only at the last layers.
Moreover, the behavior of DNNs compared to the linear classifiers SVM and LR is
quite the same on the training and test data regardless of whether the network
generalizes. On the other hand, the similarity to k-NN holds only at the
absence of overfitting. Our results suggests that k-NN behavior of the network

in recent years. They guarantee an investigation of the entire input image for
the object to be detected and allow a localization of that object. Despite the
current trend towards deep neural networks, sliding window methods are still
used in combination with convolutional neural networks. The risk of overlooking
an object is clearly reduced compared to alternative detection approaches which
detect objects based on shape, edges or color. Nevertheless, the sliding window
technique strongly increases the computational effort as the classifier has to
verify a large number of object candidates. This paper proposes a sliding
window approach which also uses depth information from a stereo camera. This
leads to a greatly decreased number of object candidates without significantly
reducing the detection accuracy. A theoretical investigation of the
conventional sliding window approach is presented first. Other publications to
date only mentioned rough estimations of the computational cost. A mathematical
derivation clarifies the number of object candidates with respect to parameters
such as image and object size. Subsequently, the proposed disparity sliding
window approach is presented in detail. The approach is evaluated on pedestrian
detection with annotations and images from the KITTI object detection
benchmark. Furthermore, a comparison with two state-of-the-art methods is made.

empirically derived dilution factors of a sample of nearby SNe Ic, which were
derived in Paper I of a two-paper series, as a proxy for the dilution factors
of GRB-SNe. It is seen that the dilution factors as a function of temperature
in $VI$ display the least amount of scatter, relative to $BVI$ and $BV$. A
power-law function is fit to the former, and is used to derive model dilution
factors which are then used to derive EPM distances to GRB-SNe 1998bw and
2003lw: $36.7\pm9.6$ and $372.2\pm137.1$ Mpc, respectively. In linear Hubble
diagrams in filters $BVR$, I determine the offset of the Hubble ridge line, and
armed with the peak absolute magnitudes in these filters for the two
aforementioned GRB-SNe, I find a (weighted average) Hubble constant of
$\bar{H_{0,\rm w}} = 61.9\pm12.3$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for GRB-SNe located at
redshifts $z\le0.1$. The 20\% error is consistent with the value of $H_0$
calculated by Planck and SNe Ia within 1$\sigma$. I tested the fitting method
on five nearby SNe Ic, and found that their EPM distances varied by 18-50\%,
with smaller errors found for those SNe which had more numerous usable
observations. For SN 2002ap, its EPM distance was overestimated by 18\%, and if
the distance to SN 1998bw was similarly over-estimated by the same amount, the
resultant value of the Hubble constant is $H_0 = 72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$,
which perfectly matches that obtained using SNe Ia. [abridged]

Processes with sparse rewards that computes the optimal policy exactly with no

$O( |R|^3 \times |A|^2 )$ and memory complexity of $O( |R| \times |A| )$, where
$|R|$ is the number of reward sources and $|A|$ is the number of actions.
Furthermore, we describe a companion algorithm that can follow the optimal
policy from any initial state without computing the entire value function,
instead computing on-demand the value of states as they are needed. The
algorithm to solve the MDP does not depend on the size of the state space for
either time or memory complexity, and the ability to follow the optimal policy
is linear in time and space with the path length of following the optimal
policy from the initial state. We demonstrate the algorithm operation side by

the evolution of molecular clouds (MCs) undergoing hierarchical gravitational
contraction. The cloud's evolution is characterized by an initial increase in
its mass, density, and star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE) as it
contracts, followed by a decrease of these quantities as newly formed massive
stars begin to disrupt the cloud. The main parameter of the model is the
maximum mass reached by the cloud during its evolution. Thus, specifying the
instantaneous mass and some other variable completely determines the cloud's
evolutionary stage. We apply the model to interpret the observed scatter in
SFEs of the cloud sample compiled by Lada et al.\ as an evolutionary effect so
that, although clouds such as California and Orion A have similar masses, they
are in very different evolutionary stages, causing their very different
observed SFRs and SFEs. The model predicts that the California cloud will
eventually reach a significantly larger total mass than the Orion A cloud.
Next, we apply the model to derive estimated ages of the clouds since the time
when approximately 25\% of their mass had become molecular. We find ages from
$\sim 1.5$ to 27 Myr, with the most inactive clouds being the youngest. Further
predictions of the model are that clouds with very low SFEs should have massive
atomic envelopes constituting the majority of their gravitational mass, and
that low-mass clouds ($M \sim 10^3$-$10^4 \, M_\odot$) end their lives with a
mini-burst of star formation, reaching SFRs $\sim 300$-$500\, M_\odot$
Myr$^{-1}$. By this time, they have contracted to become compact ($\sim 1$ pc)
massive star-forming clumps, in general embedded within larger GMCs.

strains induced by self-equilibrated localized actions. Under this formulation
augmented by interface conditions, the linearized formulation remains valid.
This approach eliminates the need for examining separate sections with
subsequent conjugation. Only conditions related to the discontinuities should
be satisfied, while the continuity in other respects preserves itself
automatically. No obstacle remains for the continuous Fourier transform. For a
uniform partitioning, the discrete transform is used together with the
continuous one. We demonstrate the technique by obtaining the Floquet wave
dispersive relations with their dependence upon interface stiffness. To this
end, we briefly consider the flexural wave in the segmented beam on Winkler's
foundation, the gravity wave in a plate (also segmented) on deep water and the
Floquet-Rayleigh wave in such a plate on an elastic half-space. Besides, we
present the wave equations developed for an elastic medium with
discontinuities.

  Conditions",,,,,"physics.class-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contact dynamics (CD) is a powerful method to solve the dynamics of large
systems of colliding rigid bodies. CD can be computationally more efficient
than classical penalty-based discrete element methods (DEM) for simulating
contact between stiff materials such as rock, glass, or engineering metals.
However, by idealizing bodies as perfectly rigid, contact forces computed by CD
can be non-unique due to indeterminacy in the contact network, which is a
common occurence in dense granular flows. We propose a CD method that is
designed to identify only the unique set of contact forces that would be
predicted by a soft particle method, such as DEM, in the limit of large
stiffness. The method involves applying an elastic compatibility condition to
the contact forces, which maintains no-penetration constraints but filters out
force distributions that could not have arisen from stiff elastic contacts. The
method can be used as a post-processing step that could be integrated into
existing CD codes with minimal effort. We demonstrate its efficacy in a variety
of indeterminate problems, including some involving multiple materials,
non-spherical shapes, and nonlinear contact constitutive laws.

combination of multiple zeta values. However, in the literature, there is no
formula completely revealing this relation. In this paper, using permutations
and compositions, we establish two explicit formulas for the Euler sums, and
show that all the Euler sums are indeed expressible in terms of MZVs. Moreover,
we apply this method to the alternating Euler sums, and show that all the
alternating Euler sums are reducible to alternating MZVs. Some famous results,
such as the Euler theorem, the Borwein--Borwein--Girgensohn theorems, and the
Flajolet--Salvy theorems can be obtained directly from our theory. Some other
special cases, such as the explicit expressions of $S_{r^m,q}$,
$S_{r^m,\bar{q}}$, $S_{\bar{r}^m,q}$ and $S_{\bar{r}^m,\bar{q}}$, are also
presented here. The corresponding Maple programs are developed to help us
compute all the sums of weight $w\leq 11$ for non-alternating case and of
weight $w\leq 6$ for alternating case.

software for generating products from the data of these two satellites was
taken up subsequently in the year 2004 and the same was installed at the Indian
Meteorological Department, New Delhi in January 2006. Registration has been one
of the most fundamental operations to generate almost all the data products
from the remotely sensed data. Registration is a challenging task due to
inevitable radiometric and geometric distortions during the acquisition
process. Besides the presence of clouds makes the problem more complicated. In
this paper, we present an algorithm for multitemporal and multiband
registration. In addition, India facing reference boundaries for the CCD data
of INSAT-3A have also been generated. The complete implementation is made up of
the following steps: 1) automatic identification of the ground control points
(GCPs) in the sensed data, 2) finding the optimal transformation model based on
the match-points, and 3) resampling the transformed imagery to the reference
coordinates. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the real datasets
from KALPANA-1 and INSAT-3A. Both KALAPANA-1 and INSAT-3A have recently been
decommissioned due to lack of fuel, however, the experience gained from them
have given rise to a series of meteorological satellites and associated

to dynamically change the mobility behavior of individual vehicles. The
underlying overall goal is to minimize the total dwell time of the vehicles
within the road network. In this paper, different bottleneck-aware methods for
dynamic vehicle routing are compared in comprehensive simulations. As a

implementation of dynamic lanes in inner cities most of the time only shift

(HUFT) \cite{YLWU1,YLWU2} for all basic forces and elementary particles within
the framework of gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT)\cite{YLWU3,YLWU4} in
hyper-spacetime. GQFT treats gravity as a gauge theory in the framework of
quantum field theory to avoid the long term obstacle between the general
relativity and quantum mechanics. HUFT is built based on the guiding principle:
the dimension of hyper-spacetime correlates to intrinsic quantum numbers of
basic building blocks of nature, and the action describing the laws of nature
obeys the gauge invariance and coordinate independence, which is more
fundamental than that proposed by Einstein for general relativity. The basic
gravitational field is defined in biframe hyper-spacetime as a bicovariant
vector field, it is a gauge-type hyper-gravifield rather than a metric field.
HUFT is characterized by a bimaximal Poincar\'e and hyper-spin gauge symmetry
PO(1,$D_h$-1)$\Join$SP(1,$D_h$-1) with a global and local conformal scaling
invariance in biframe hyper-spacetime. The gravitational origin of gauge
symmetry is revealed through the hyper-gravifield that plays an essential role
as a Goldstone-like field, which enables us to demonstrate the gauge-gravity
and gravity-geometry correspondences and to corroborate the gravitational
gauge-geometry duality with an emergent hidden general linear group symmetry
GL($D_h$,R). The Taiji Program in Space for the gravitational wave detection in
China\cite{Nature,Taiji,HUWU} is briefly outlined.
