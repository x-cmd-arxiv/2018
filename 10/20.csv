suspensions such as quicksand remains a practical and conceptual challenge.
Here we use an ultrasonic probe to investigate the dynamics of a steel ball
sinking in a 3D dense glass bead packing saturated by water. We show that the
frictional model developed for dry granular media can be used to describe the
ball motion induced by horizontal vibration. From this rheology we infer the
static friction coefficient and effective viscosity that decrease when
increasing the vibration intensity. Our main finding is that the
vibration-induced reduction of the yield stress and increase of the sinking
depth are presumably due to induced slipping at the grain contacts but without
visible plastic rearrangements of grains, in contrast to dry granular packings.
To explain these results, we propose a mechanism of acoustic lubrication that
reduces the inter-particle friction and leads to a decrease of the yield
stress. This scenario is different from the mechanism of liquefaction usually
invoked in loosely packed quicksands where the vibration-induced compaction
increases the pore pressure and decreases the confining pressure on the solid
skeleton, thus reducing the granular resistance to external load.

heterogeneous cellular network comprised of a macro cell and a small cell,
where a passive eavesdropper is assumed to tap the transmissions of both the
macro cell and small cell. In the macro cell, a macro base station (MBS)
equipped with multiple distributed antennas sends its confidential information
to a macro user (MU) through an opportunistic transmit antenna. Meanwhile, in
the small cell, a small base station (SBS) transmits to a small user (SU) over
the same spectrum used by MBS. We propose an interference-canceled
opportunistic antenna selection (IC-OAS) scheme to enhance physical-layer
security for the heterogeneous network. To be specific, when MBS sends its
confidential message to MU through an opportunistic distributed antenna, a
special signal is artificially designed and emitted at MBS to ensure that the
received interference at MU from SBS is canceled out. For comparison, the
conventional interference-limited opportunistic antenna selection (IL-OAS) is
considered as a benchmark. We characterize the security-reliability tradeoff
(SRT) for the proposed IC-OAS and conventional IL-OAS schemes in terms of
deriving their closed-form expressions of intercept probability and outage
probability. Numerical results show that compared with the conventional IL-OAS,
the proposed IC-OAS scheme not only brings SRT benefits to the macro cell, but
also has the potential of improving the SRT of small cell by increasing the
number of distributed antennas. Additionally, by jointly taking into account
the macro cell and small cell, an overall SRT of the proposed IC-OAS scheme is
shown to be significantly better than that of the conventional IL-OAS approach

By a combination of quantitative low-energy electron diffraction, scanning

oxide wires are completely reduced by H$_2$ at temperatures above 320 K and a
3x1 ordered Ir$_2$Co or Pt$_2$Co surface alloy is formed. Depending on
temperature the surface alloy on Ir(100) is either hydrogen covered (T < 400 K)
or clean and eventually undergoes an irreversible order-disorder transition at
about 570 K. The Pt$_2$Co surface alloy disorders with the desorption of
hydrogen, whereby Co submerges into subsurface sites. Vice versa, applying
stronger oxidants than O$_2$ such as NO$_2$ leads to the formation of CoO3
chains on Ir(100) in a 3x1 superstructure. On Pt(100) such a CoO$_3$ phase
could not be prepared so far, which however, is due to the UHV conditions of

forecasting of a process evolving over a graph. We make use of the
(approximate) time-vertex stationarity assumption, i.e., timevarying graph
signals whose first and second order statistical moments are invariant over
time and correlated to a known graph topology. The latter is combined with VAR
and VARMA models to tackle the dimensionality issues present in predicting the

the data to the graph spectral domain: (i) the multivariate model estimation
reduces to that of fitting a number of uncorrelated univariate ARMA models and
(ii) an optimal low-rank data representation can be exploited so as to further
reduce the estimation costs. In the case that the multivariate process can be
observed at a subset of nodes, the proposed models extend naturally to Kalman
filtering on graphs allowing for optimal tracking. Numerical experiments with

provide stringent constraints using a series of cosmological data sets, namely,
the cosmic microwave background observations (CMB), baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO), joint light curve analysis (JLA) from supernovae type Ia,
redshift space distortions (RSD), and the cosmic chronometers (CC). From the
qualitative evolution of the models, we find all of them are able to execute a
fine transition from the past decelerating phase to the presently accelerating
expansion where in addition, the equation of state of the scalar field (also
the effective equation of state) might be close to that of the $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology depending on its free parameters. From the observational analyses, we
find that the scalar field parameters are unconstrained irrespective of all the
observational datasets. In fact, we find that the quintessence scalar field
models are pretty much determined by the CMB observations since any of the
external datasets such as BAO, JLA, RSD, CC does not add any constraining power
to CMB. Additionally, we observe a strong negative correlation between the
parameters $H_0$ (present value of the Hubble parameter), $\Omega_{m0}$
(density parameter for the matter sector, i.e., cold dark matter plus baryons)
exists, while no correlation between $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ (amplitude of the
matter fluctuation) are not correlated. We also comment that the present models
are unable to reconcile the tension on $H_0$. Finally, we conclude our work
with the Bayesian analyses which report that the non-interacting $\Lambda$CDM
model is preferred over all the quintessence scalar field models.

sits at the interdisciplinary crossroads of physics, biology, chemistry, and
computer science. Memory connotes the ability to encode, access, and erase
signatures of past history in the state of a system. Once the system has
completely relaxed to thermal equilibrium, it is no longer able to recall
aspects of its evolution. Memory of initial conditions or previous training
protocols will be lost. Thus many forms of memory are intrinsically tied to
far-from-equilibrium behavior and to transient response to a perturbation. This
general behavior arises in diverse contexts in condensed matter physics and
materials: phase change memory, shape memory, echoes, memory effects in
glasses, return-point memory in disordered magnets, as well as related contexts
in computer science. Yet, as opposed to the situation in biology, there is
currently no common categorization and description of the memory behavior that
appears to be prevalent throughout condensed-matter systems. Here we focus on
material memories. We will describe the basic phenomenology of a few of the
known behaviors that can be understood as constituting a memory. We hope that
this will be a guide towards developing the unifying conceptual underpinnings
for a broad understanding of memory effects that appear in materials.

inventory estimation. However, it is not possible to derive a design-unbiased
variance estimator for a systematic sample using one random start. As a result,
many forest inventory analysts resort to applying variance estimators that are
design-unbiased following simple random sampling to their systematic samples
even though this typically leads to conservative estimates of error. We explore
the influence of spatial autocorrelation on variance estimation when systematic
sampling is employed using repeated sampling. We generate a sequence of 1000
synthetic populations with increasing spatial autocorrelation and repeatedly
sample from each to examine how the performance of estimators change as spatial
autocorrelation changes. We also repeatedly sample from a tree census plot in
Harvard Forest, Massachusetts and examine the performance of similar
estimators. Results indicate that applying variance estimators that are
unbiased following simple random sampling to systematic samples from
populations exhibiting stronger spatial autocorrelation tend to be more
conservative. We also find that incorporating ancillary wall-to-wall
covariates, e.g., remote sensing data, using generalized regression estimators
can reduce variance over-estimation by explaining some or all of the spatial
structure in the population.

a striking absence of the classic U-shaped test error curve: test error keeps
decreasing in wider networks. This suggests that there might not be a

was originally claimed by, e.g., Geman et al. (1992). Motivated by the shaky
evidence used to support this claim in neural networks, we measure bias and
variance in the modern setting. We find that both bias and variance can
decrease as the number of parameters grows. To better understand this, we
introduce a new decomposition of the variance to disentangle the effects of
optimization and data sampling. We also provide theoretical analysis in a
simplified setting that is consistent with our empirical findings.

Large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) reduces this degeneracy in a unique way by
providing a spin-orbital-entangled ground state for 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition
metal compounds. In particular, the spin-orbital-entangled Kramers doublet,
known as the $J_{\mathbf{eff}}$=1/2 pseudospin, appears in layered iridates and
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, manifesting a relativistic Mott insulating phase. Such
entanglement, however, seems barely attainable in 3$d$ transition metal oxides,
where the SOC is small and the orbital angular momentum is easily quenched.
From experimental and theoretical evidence, here we report on the CuAl$_2$O$_4$

synthesis of the cubic CuAl$_2$O$_4$ single crystal, density functional theory

orbital-momentum-quenched $S$=1/2 state. The electron-addition spectra probing
unoccupied states are well described by the $j_{\mathbf{eff}}$=1/2 hole state,
whereas electron-removal spectra have a rich multiplet structure. The fully
relativistic entity found in CuAl$_2$O$_4$ provides new insight into the

directly incorporated into the variational regularisation approach in the form
of a partial differential equation that models the registration as either mass-

cavity concept to achieve perfect absorption of infrared light in much thinner

single set of cavity materials. It requires a nanofilm with giant refractive

semi-conductors and topological insulators) backed by a transparent spacer and
a metal mirror. The nanofilm acts both as absorber and multiple reflector for
the internal cavity waves, which after escaping follow a fractal phasor
trajectory. This enables a totally destructive optical interference for a
nanofilm thickness more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than \lambda. With
this remarkable effect, we demonstrate angle-insensitive perfect absorption in

iterative reward-driven exploration of candidate motor activations
simultaneously refines the inverse map and finds a functional locomotor

without the need for dark energy or modified gravity. When treating the
universe as a quantum system, one typically focuses on the scale factor (of an
FRW spacetime) and ignores many other degrees of freedom. However, the
information capacity of the discarded variables will inevitably change as the
universe expands, generating ""quantum bias"" (QB) in the Friedmann equations
[Phys. Lett. A 382, 36, 2555 (2018)|arXiv:1707.05789]. If information could be
stored in each Planck-volume independently, this effect would give rise to a
constant acceleration $10^{120}$ times larger than that observed, reproducing
the usual cosmological constant problem. However, once information capacity is
quantified according to the holographic principle, cosmic acceleration is far
smaller and depends on the past behaviour of the scale factor. I calculate this
holographic quantum bias, derive the semiclassical Friedmann equations, and
obtain their general solution for a spatially-flat universe containing matter

new theory is shown to be falsifiable, but nonetheless consistent with current

extending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. These
self-consistent studies considered a BHNS system with mass ratio $q=3:1$, BH
spin $a/M_{BH}=0.75$ aligned with the total orbital angular momentum (OAM), and
a NS that is irrotational, threaded by an aligned B field, and modeled by an

establishing BHNS systems as viable progenitors of central engines that power
short gamma--ray bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as
multimessenger sources, we survey different BHNS configurations that differ in
BH spin ($a/M_{BH} =-0.5,\,0,\,0.5,\,0.75$), in the mass ratio ($q=3:1$ and

Various mechanisms have been proposed for their existence including primordial
fields generated by inflation, or amplification and injection by compact
astrophysical objects. Separating the potential impact of each magnetogenesis
scenario on the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field and their
impact on gas dynamics may give insight into the physics that magnetised our
Universe. In this work, we demonstrate that because the induction equation and
solenoidal constraint are linear with $B$, the contribution from different
sources of magnetic field can be separated in cosmological magnetohydrodynamics
simulations and their evolution and influence on the gas dynamics can be
tracked. Exploiting this property, we develop a magnetic field tracer algorithm
for cosmological simulations that can track the origin and evolution of
different components of the magnetic field. We present a suite of cosmological
magnetohydrodynamical RAMSES simulations that employ this algorithm where the
primordial field strength is varied to determine the contributions of the
primordial and supernovae-injected magnetic fields to the total magnetic energy
as a function of time and spatial location. We find that, for our specific
model, the supernova-injected fields rarely penetrate far from haloes, despite
often dominating the total magnetic energy in the simulations. The magnetic
energy density from the supernova-injected field scales with density with a
power-law slope steeper than 4/3 and often dominates the total magnetic energy
inside of haloes. However, the star formation rates in our simulations are not
affected by the presence of magnetic fields, for the ranges of primordial field
strengths examined. These simulations represent a first demonstration of the
magnetic field tracer algorithm (abridged).

entirely in terms of the ratio of Higgs doublet expectation values and a single
universal phase appearing in the effective couplings of the Standard Model-like
Higgs boson to fermions, without direct reference to the heavy Higgs boson
masses or couplings. The recent bound from the ACME II experiment constrains
the phases of the couplings of the Standard Model-like Higgs boson to up-type
quarks and leptons at the part per mil level in Type I and IV two Higgs doublet
models. In Type II and III models these phases are constrained at the two parts
per mil or better level except in a tiny sliver of parameter space with nearly
equal Higgs doublet expectation values where destructive interference among
contributing diagrams happens to occur. In a more general phenomenological
parameterization with individual effective phases in the couplings of the

the top quark and electron coupling phases are constrained at the part per mil

ColorCheckers localization and (2) ColorChecker patches recognition. For the
ColorChecker localization, we trained a detection convolutional neural network
using synthetic images. The synthetic images are created with the 3D models of
the ColorChecker and different background images. The output of the neural
networks are the bounding box of each possible ColorChecker candidates in the
input image. Each bounding box defines a cropped image which is evaluated by a
recognition system, and each image is canonized with regards to color and
dimensions. Subsequently, all possible color patches are extracted and grouped
with respect to the center's distance. Each group is evaluated as a candidate
for a ColorChecker part, and its position in the scene is estimated. Finally, a
cost function is applied to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation. The method
is tested using real and synthetic images. The proposed method is fast, robust
to overlaps and invariant to affine projections. The algorithm also performs
well in case of multiple ColorCheckers detection.

propose a method to automatically tune this parameter using only one training

validation loss, beginning with smaller, general subwords and adding larger,
more specific units over the course of training. Our method matches the results
found with grid search, optimizing segmentation granularity without any

assessed using counterfactual reasoning. At each timestep, an agent simulates
alternate actions that it could have taken, and computes their effect on the
behavior of other agents. Actions that lead to bigger changes in other agents'
behavior are considered influential and are rewarded. We show that this is
equivalent to rewarding agents for having high mutual information between their
actions. Empirical results demonstrate that influence leads to enhanced
coordination and communication in challenging social dilemma environments,
dramatically increasing the learning curves of the deep RL agents, and leading
to more meaningful learned communication protocols. The influence rewards for
all agents can be computed in a decentralized way by enabling agents to learn a
model of other agents using deep neural networks. In contrast, key previous
works on emergent communication in the MARL setting were unable to learn
diverse policies in a decentralized manner and had to resort to centralized

graphs, a quantum circulant graph. Circulant graphs are the Cayley graphs of
cyclic groups. Quantum circulant graphs with standard vertex conditions
maintain important features of the prototypical quantum star graph model. In
particular, we show the spectrum is encoded in a secular equation with similar
features. The secular equation of a quantum circulant graph takes two forms
depending on whether the edge lengths respect the cyclic symmetry of the graph.
When all the edge lengths are incommensurate, the spectral statistics
correspond to those of random matrices from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble
according to the conjecture of Bohigas, Giannoni and Schmit. When the edge
lengths respect the cyclic symmetry the spectrum decomposes into subspectra
whose corresponding eigenfunctions transform according to irreducible
representations of the cyclic group. We show that the subspectra exhibit
intermediate spectral statistics and analyze the small and large parameter
asymptotics of the two-point correlation function, applying techniques
developed from star graphs. The particular form of the intermediate statistics
differs from that seen for star graphs or Dirac rose graphs. As a further
application, we show how the secular equations can be used to obtain spectral
zeta functions using a contour integral technique. Results for the spectral
determinant and vacuum energy of circulant graphs are obtained from the zeta
functions.

  channel flow","13 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finite-size neutrally buoyant particles in a channel flow are known to
accumulate at specific equilibrium positions or spots in the channel
cross-section if the flow inertia is finite at the particle scale. Experiments
in different conduit geometries have shown that while reaching equilibrium
locations, particles tend also to align regularly in the streamwise direction.
In this paper, the Force Coupling Method was used to numerically investigate
the inertia-induced particle alignment, using square channel geometry. The
method was first shown to be suitable to capture the quasi-steady lift force
that leads to particle cross-streamline migration in channel flow. Then the
particle alignment in the flow direction was investigated by calculating the
particle relative trajectories as a function of flow inertia and of the ratio
between the particle size and channel hydraulic diameter. The flow streamlines
were examined around the freely rotating particles at equilibrium, revealing
stable small-scale vortices between aligned particles. The streamwise
inter-particle spacing between aligned particles at equilibrium was calculated
and compared to available experimental data in square channel flow (Gao {\it et
al.} Microfluidics and Nanofluidics {\bf 21}, 154 (2017)). The new result
highlighted by our numerical simulations is that the inter-particle spacing is
unconditionally stable only for a limited number of aligned particles in a
single train, the threshold number being dependent on the confinement
(particle-to-channel size ratio) and on the Reynolds number. For instance, when
the particle Reynolds number is $\approx1$ and the particle-to-channel height
size ratio is $\approx0.1$, the maximum number of stable aligned particles per
train is equal to 3. This agrees with statistics realized on the experiments of

zeroing outs which subsumes these two approaches, which we call the Solar
method, and an even more general method based on monomial degenerations, which
we call the Galactic method.
  We then design a suite of techniques for proving lower bounds on the value of
$\omega$, the exponent of matrix multiplication, which can be achieved by
algorithms using many tensors $T$ and the Galactic method. Some of our
techniques exploit `local' properties of $T$, like finding a sub-tensor of $T$
which is so `weak' that $T$ itself couldn't be used to achieve a good bound on
$\omega$, while others exploit `global' properties, like $T$ being a monomial
degeneration of the structural tensor of a group algebra.
  Our main result is that there is a universal constant $\ell>2$ such that a
large class of tensors generalizing the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor $CW_q$
cannot be used within the Galactic method to show a bound on $\omega$ better
than $\ell$, for any $q$. We give evidence that previous lower-bounding
techniques were not strong enough to show this. We also prove a number of
complementary results along the way, including that for any group $G$, the
structural tensor of $\mathbb{C}[G]$ can be used to recover the best bound on
$\omega$ which the Coppersmith-Winograd approach gets using $CW_{|G|-2}$ as
long as the asymptotic rank of the structural tensor is not too large.

decision making. An unavoidable tension exists between accuracy gains obtained
by using sensitive information (e.g., gender or ethnic group) as part of a
statistical model, and any commitment to protect these characteristics. Often,
due to biases present in the data, using the sensitive information in the
functional form of a classifier improves classification accuracy. In this paper
we show how it is possible to get the best of both worlds: optimize model
accuracy and fairness without explicitly using the sensitive feature in the
functional form of the model, thereby treating different individuals equally.
Our method is based on two key ideas. On the one hand, we propose to use
Multitask Learning (MTL), enhanced with fairness constraints, to jointly learn
group specific classifiers that leverage information between sensitive groups.
On the other hand, since learning group specific models might not be permitted,
we propose to first predict the sensitive features by any learning method and
then to use the predicted sensitive feature to train MTL with fairness
constraints. This enables us to tackle fairness with a three-pronged approach,
that is, by increasing accuracy on each group, enforcing measures of fairness
during training, and protecting sensitive information during testing.
Experimental results on two real datasets support our proposal, showing
substantial improvements in both accuracy and fairness.

system require large balancing reserves for reliable operations. Aggregated and
coordinated behind-the-meter loads can provide these fast reserves, but
represent energy-constrained and uncertain reserves (in their energy state and
capacity). To optimally dispatch uncertain, energy-constrained reserves,
optimization-based techniques allow one to develop an appropriate trade-off
between closed-loop performance and robustness of the dispatch. Therefore, this
paper investigates the uncertainty associated with energy-constrained
aggregations of flexible, behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs).
The uncertainty studied herein is associated with estimating the state of
charge and the capacity of an aggregation of DERs (i.e., a virtual energy
storage system or VESS). To that effect, a risk-based chance-constrained
control strategy is developed that optimizes the operational risk of
unexpectedly saturating the VESS against deviating generators from their
scheduled set-points. The controller coordinates energy-constrained VESSs to
minimize unscheduled participation of and overcome ramp-rate limited generators
for balancing variability from renewable generation, while taking into account
grid conditions. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
simulation-based analysis is carried out on an augmented IEEE RTS-96 network
with uncertain energy resources and temperature-based dynamic line ratings.

constrained optimization where model parameters in a wave equation are adjusted

minimized. In a sequence of papers, we have shown that the quadratic
Wasserstein distance from optimal transport is to prefer as misfit functional
over the standard $L^2$ norm. Datasets need however first to be normalized
since seismic signals do not satisfy the requirements of optimal transport.
There has been a puzzling contradiction in the results. Normalization methods
that satisfy theorems pointing to ideal properties for FWI have not performed
well in practical computations, and other scaling methods that do not satisfy
these theorems have performed much better in practice. In this paper, we will
shed light on this issue and resolve this contradiction.

systems starting from arbitrary initial many-body density matrices. We show how
this can be done for both Bosons and Fermions, and for both closed and open
quantum systems, using additional sources coupled to bilinears of the fields at
the initial time, calculating Green's functions in a theory with these sources,
and then taking appropriate set of derivatives of these Green's functions
w.r.t. initial sources to obtain physical observables. The set of derivatives
depend on the initial density matrix. The physical correlators in a dynamics
with arbitrary initial conditions do not satisfy Wick's theorem, even for
non-interacting systems. However our formalism constructs intermediate
``n-particle Green's functions'' which obey Wick's theorem and provide a
prescription to obtain physical correlation functions from them. This allows us
to obtain analytic answers for all physical many body correlation functions of
a non-interacting system even when it is initialized to an arbitrary density
matrix. We use these exact expressions to obtain an estimate of the violation
of Wick's theorem, and relate it to presence of connected multi-particle
initial correlations in the system. We illustrate this new formalism by
calculating density and current profiles in many body Fermionic and Bosonic
open quantum systems initialized to non-trivial density matrices. We have also
shown how this formalism can be extended to interacting many body systems.

effects and a distribution of ellipticities are accounted for, dynamical
evolution can be modelled to include the effects of Galactic tides and stellar
mass perturbers, over the lifetime of the solar neighbourhood. This furnishes a
prediction for the relative velocity between the components of a binary and
their projected separation. Taking a carefully selected small sample of 81
solar neighbourhood wide binaries from the {\it Hipparcos} catalogue, we
identify these same stars in the recent Gaia DR2, to test the prediction
mentioned using the latest and most accurate astrometry available. The results
are consistent with the Newtonian prediction for projected separations below
7000 AU, but inconsistent with it at larger separations, where accelerations
are expected to be lower than the critical $a_{0}=1.2 \times 10^{-10} $ { m

black box predictions from deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs tend to
be overconfident in predictions on unseen data and can give unpredictable
results for far-from-distribution test data. The importance of predictions that
are robust to this distributional shift is evident for safety-critical
applications, such as collision avoidance around pedestrians. Measures of model
uncertainty can be used to identify unseen data, but the state-of-the-art
extraction methods such as Bayesian neural networks are mostly intractable to
compute. This paper uses MC-Dropout and Bootstrapping to give computationally
tractable and parallelizable uncertainty estimates. The methods are embedded in
a Safe Reinforcement Learning framework to form uncertainty-aware navigation
around pedestrians. The result is a collision avoidance policy that knows what
it does not know and cautiously avoids pedestrians that exhibit unseen
behavior. The policy is demonstrated in simulation to be more robust to novel
observations and take safer actions than an uncertainty-unaware baseline.

be the brightest neutron source of the world. The SBR can be effectively
improved with background reduction. The Multi-Grid, a large-area thermal
neutron detector with a solid boron carbide converter, is a novel solution for
chopper spectrometers. This detector will be installed for the three
prospective chopper spectrometers at the ESS. As the Multi-Grid detector is a
large area detector with a complex structure, its intrinsic background and its
suppression via advanced shielding design should be investigated in its
complexity, as it cannot be naively calculated. The intrinsic scattered neutron
background and its effect on the SBR is determined via a detailed Monte Carlo
simulation for the Multi-Grid detector module, designed for the CSPEC
instrument at the ESS. The impact of the detector vessel and the neutron
entrance window on scattering is determined, revealing the importance of an
optimised internal detector shielding. The background-reducing capacity of
common shielding geometries, like side-shielding and end-shielding is
determined by using perfect absorber as shielding material, and common
shielding materials, like B$_{4}$C and Cd are also tested. On the basis of the
comparison of the effectiveness of the different shielding topologies and

effective tran- sient diffusion behaviour in heterogeneous media in which there
is a large contrast between the phase diffusivities. In this case mobile
species can diffuse over long distances through the fast phase in the time
scale of diffusion in the slow phase. At macroscopic scale, contrasted phase
diffusivities lead to a memory effect that cannot be properly described by
classical Fick's second law. Here we obtain effective governing equations
through a two-scale approach for composite materials consisting of a fast
matrix and slow inclusions. The micro-macro transition is similar to
first-order computational homogenisation, and involves the solution of a
transient diffusion boundary-value problem in a Representative Volume Element
of the microstructure. Different from computational homogenisation, we propose
a semi-analytical mean-field estimate of the composite response based on the
exact solution for a single inclusion developed in our previous work [Brassart,
L., Stainier, L., 2018. Effective transient behaviour of inclusions in
diffusion problems. Z. Angew Math. Mech. 98, 981-998]. A key outcome of the
model is that the macroscopic concentration is not one-to-one related to the
macroscopic chemical potential, but obeys a local kinetic equation associated
with diffusion in the slow phase. The history-dependent macroscopic response
admits a representation based on internal variables, enabling efficient time
integration. We show that the local chemical kinetics can result in non-Fickian
behaviour in macroscale boundary-value problems.

ultracold neutron (UCN) source is presented. The essential idea of the compact
UCN source is to enclose a volume of superfluid $^{4}\mathrm{He}$ converter
with a supercold moderator in the vicinity of a low-radiation neutron
production target from (p, n) reactions. The supercold moderator should possess
an ability to produce cold neutron flux with a peak brightness near the
single-phonon excitation band of the superfluid $^{4}\mathrm{He}$ converter,
thereby augmenting the UCN production in the compact UCN source even with very
low intensity of neutron brightness. The performance of the compact UCN source
is studied in terms of the UCN production and thermal load in the UCN
converter. With the proposed concept of the compact UCN source, a UCN
production rate of $P_{\mathrm{UCN}}=80\mathrm{UCN}/\mathrm{cc}/\mathrm{sec}$
in the UCN converter could be obtained while maintaining thermal load of on the
superfluid $^{4}\mathrm{He}$ and its container at a level of $22\mathrm{mW}$.
This study shows that the compact UCN source can produce a high enough density
of UCN at a small-scale, low-energy, pulsed-proton beam facility with reduced
efforts on the cooling and radiation protection.

to address these issues. This paper proposes a novel SL prediction method,
named SL2MF, which employs logistic matrix factorization to learn latent
representations of genes from the observed SL data. The probability that two
genes are likely to form SL is modeled by the linear combination of gene latent
vectors. As known SL pairs are more trustworthy than unknown pairs, we design
importance weighting schemes to assign higher importance weights for known SL
pairs and lower importance weights for unknown pairs in SL2MF. Moreover, we
also incorporate biological knowledge about genes from protein-protein
interaction (PPI) data and Gene Ontology (GO). In particular, we calculate the
similarity between genes based on their GO annotations and topological
properties in the PPI network. Extensive experiments on the SL interaction data
from SynLethDB database have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
SL2MF.

solving the maximum likelihood (ML) optimization problem, and the ML estimator
is defined to be the optimal solution of this problem. It is well known that
the ML estimator exists when the data is non-separable, but fails to exist when
the data is separable. First-order methods are the algorithms of choice for
solving large-scale instances of the logistic regression problem. In this
paper, we introduce a pair of condition numbers that measure the degree of
non-separability or separability of a given dataset in the setting of binary
classification, and we study how these condition numbers relate to and inform
the properties and the convergence guarantees of first-order methods. When the
training data is non-separable, we show that the degree of non-separability
naturally enters the analysis and informs the properties and convergence
guarantees of two standard first-order methods: steepest descent (for any given
norm) and stochastic gradient descent. Expanding on the work of Bach, we also
show how the degree of non-separability enters into the analysis of linear
convergence of steepest descent (without needing strong convexity), as well as
the adaptive convergence of stochastic gradient descent. When the training data
is separable, first-order methods rather curiously have good empirical success,
which is not well understood in theory. In the case of separable data, we
demonstrate how the degree of separability enters into the analysis of $\ell_2$
steepest descent and stochastic gradient descent for delivering
approximate-maximum-margin solutions with associated computational guarantees
as well. This suggests that first-order methods can lead to statistically
meaningful solutions in the separable case, even though the ML solution does

extraordinarily precise data analysis methods to separate the cosmological

challenge has led to a diversity of proposed analyses, including delay spectra,
imaging power spectra, m-mode analysis, and numerous others. This diversity of
approach is a strength, but has also led to confusion within the community
about whether insights gleaned by one group are applicable to teams working in
different analysis frameworks. In this paper we show that all existing analysis
proposals can be classified into two distinct families based on whether they
estimate the power spectrum of the measured or reconstructed sky. This subtle
difference in the statistical question posed largely determines the
susceptibility of the analyses to foreground emission and calibration errors,
and ultimately the science different analyses can pursue. In this paper we
detail the origin of the two analysis families, categorize the analyses being
actively developed, and explore their relative sensitivities to foreground
contamination and calibration errors.

eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator geared toward prediction and control.
The method leverages the richness of the spectrum of the Koopman operator away
from attractors to construct a rich set of eigenfunctions such that the state
(or any other observable quantity of interest) is in the span of these
eigenfunctions and hence predictable in a linear fashion. The eigenfunction
construction is optimization-based with no dictionary selection required. Once
a predictor for the uncontrolled part of the system is obtained in this way,
the incorporation of control is done through a multi-step prediction error
minimization, carried out by a simple linear least-squares regression. The
predictor so obtained is in the form of a linear controlled dynamical system
and can be readily applied within the Koopman model predictive control
framework of [12] to control nonlinear dynamical systems using linear model
predictive control tools. The method is entirely data-driven and based purely
on convex optimization, with no reliance on neural networks or other non-convex
machine learning tools. The novel eigenfunction construction method is also
analyzed theoretically, proving rigorously that the family of eigenfunctions
obtained is rich enough to span the space of all continuous functions. In
addition, the method is extended to construct generalized eigenfunctions that
also give rise Koopman invariant subspaces and hence can be used for linear
prediction. Detailed numerical examples with code available online demonstrate
the approach, both for prediction and feedback control.

Based on these two scattering processes, random lasers can be continuously

oscillating among nanowires (or nanoflowers), demonstrating the dynamic range

Similarity - STS) is fundamental in many NLP applications. Despite the
remarkable results in supervised settings with adequate labeling, little
attention has been paid to this task in low-resource languages with
insufficient labeling. Existing approaches mostly leverage machine translation
techniques to translate sentences into rich-resource language. These approaches
either beget language biases, or be impractical in industrial applications
where spoken language scenario is more often and rigorous efficiency is
required. In this work, we propose a multilingual framework to tackle the STS
task in a low-resource language e.g. Spanish, Arabic , Indonesian and Thai, by
utilizing the rich annotation data in a rich resource language, e.g. English.
Our approach is extended from a basic monolingual STS framework to a shared
multilingual encoder pretrained with translation task to incorporate
rich-resource language data. By exploiting the nature of a shared multilingual
encoder, one sentence can have multiple representations for different target
translation language, which are used in an ensemble model to improve similarity
evaluation. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state of

contradicts both holographic expectations for the rate of complexification and
also action calculations for charged black holes. We trace the discrepancy to
an improper treatment of boundary terms when naively doing the dimensional
reduction. Once the boundary term is corrected, we find exact agreement with

Rather than having
just one decision maker deciding which arm to pull in each round, we have $n$
different decision makers (agents). In the simple stochastic setting, we show
that a ""free-riding"" agent observing another ""self-reliant"" agent can achieve
just $O(1)$ regret, as opposed to the regret lower bound of $\Omega (\log t)$
when one decision maker is playing in isolation. This result holds whenever the
self-reliant agent's strategy satisfies either one of two assumptions: (1) each
arm is pulled at least $\gamma \ln t$ times in expectation for a constant
$\gamma$ that we compute, or (2) the self-reliant agent achieves $o(t)$
realized regret with high probability. Both of these assumptions are satisfied
by standard zero-regret algorithms. Under the second assumption, we further
show that the free rider only needs to observe the number of times each arm is
pulled by the self-reliant agent, and not the rewards realized.
  In the linear contextual setting, each arm has a distribution over parameter
vectors, each agent has a context vector, and the reward realized when an agent
pulls an arm is the inner product of that agent's context vector with a
parameter vector sampled from the pulled arm's distribution. We show that the
free rider can achieve $O(1)$ regret in this setting whenever the free rider's
context is a small (in $L_2$-norm) linear combination of other agents' contexts
and all other agents pull each arm $\Omega (\log t)$ times with high
probability. Again, this condition on the self-reliant players is satisfied by
standard zero-regret algorithms like UCB. We also prove a number of lower
bounds.

Finite-size scaling is applied to determine critical exponents, which are found

networks in the discrete domain. However, when employing SBL in the continuous
domain, one is either forced to move the problem to the discrete domain or use
metrics such as BIC/AIC, and these approaches are often lacking. Discretization
can have an undesired impact on the accuracy of the results, and BIC/AIC can
fall short of achieving the desired accuracy. In this paper, we introduce two
new scoring metrics for scoring Bayesian networks in the continuous domain: the
three-part minimum description length and the renormalized normalized maximum

formulating these metrics. The metrics proposed are free of hyperparameters,
decomposable, and are asymptotically consistent. We evaluate our solution by
studying the convergence rate of the learned graph to the generating network
and, also, the structural hamming distance of the learned graph to the
generating network. Our evaluations show that the proposed metrics outperform
their competitors, the BIC/AIC metrics. Furthermore, using the proposed RNML
metric, SBL will have the fastest rate of convergence with the smallest
structural hamming distance to the generating network.

in a Dice index of 95% and an average perpendicular distance of 0.9 pixels for

classical video frame interpolation systems over the past decades. Recently, a
number of data-driven frame interpolation methods based on convolutional neural
networks have been proposed. However, existing learning based methods typically
estimate either flow or compensation kernels, thereby limiting performance on
both computational efficiency and interpolation accuracy. In this work, we
propose a motion estimation and compensation driven neural network for video
frame interpolation. A novel adaptive warping layer is developed to integrate
both optical flow and interpolation kernels to synthesize target frame pixels.
This layer is fully differentiable such that both the flow and kernel
estimation networks can be optimized jointly. The proposed model benefits from
the advantages of motion estimation and compensation methods without using
hand-crafted features. Compared to existing methods, our approach is
computationally efficient and able to generate more visually appealing results.
Furthermore, the proposed MEMC-Net can be seamlessly adapted to several video
enhancement tasks, e.g., super-resolution, denoising, and deblocking. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method
performs favorably against the state-of-the-art video frame interpolation and

goal of hadron spectroscopy. We suggest an experimentally challenging, but
model--independent way to assess which zero charge, isospin-zero mesons have a
large gluonium light-front wavefunction component in the quark and gluon Fock
space of QCD. Our method exploits QCD counting rules which relate the power-law
fall-off of production amplitudes at high momentum transfer to the meson's
twist (dimension minus spin of its minimum interpolating operators). Scalar
$0^+$ glueballs composed of two valence gluons with zero internal orbital
angular momentum have twist $\tau=2$. In contrast, quark-antiquark $|q \bar q
\rangle $ scalar mesons have twist $\tau \ge 3$ since they have nonzero orbital
angular momentum, and multi-quark states such as $|q q \bar q \bar q \rangle$
tetraquarks yield twist $\tau \ge 4$. Thus, the production cross section for
both $|q\bar{q}\rangle$ and $|qq\bar{q}\bar{q}\rangle$ mesons will be
suppressed by at least one power of momentum transfer relative to glueball
production. For example, in single inclusive particle hadroproduction $ A B \to
C X$, the cross section for glueball production at high transverse momentum
$p_T$ and fixed $x_T = 2 {p_T\over \sqrt s} $ will dominate higher twist mesons
by at least two powers of $p_T$. Similarly, in exclusive production processes
at large CM energy and fixed CM angle, the glueball rate dominates by a power
of $s$: we illustrate the method with a simple reaction, $e^-e^+ \to \phi f_0$
where the $f_0$ can be tested to be a glueball versus another type of scalar
meson.

  Information Systems (JURIX 2018) Groningen (The Netherlands), 12-14 December",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for
the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing - or the insertion of
data in the blockchain - is one of the potential applications of the blockchain
in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their
data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity.
Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on
central governmental databases. The paper starts by analysing possible
scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work
and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second,
the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using
PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain.
Third, it also addresses issues related to concepts such as distributed ledger
technology and permissioned blockchains. Finally, it raises the question of
whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance,
and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI
and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need
first to identify pain points in governance, and then consider the trade-offs
of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.

soft elastic matrix are candidates for developing soft actuators or tunable
damping devices. The possibility to reversibly drive the rigid inclusions
within such a composite together to a close-to-touching state by an external
stimulus would offer important benefits. Then, a significant tuning of the
mechanical properties could be achieved due to the resulting mechanical
hardening. For a long time, it has been argued whether a virtual touching of
the embedded magnetic particles with subsequent detachment can actually be
observed in real materials, and if so, whether the process is reversible. Here,
we present experimental results that demonstrate this phenomenon in reality.
Our system consists of two paramagnetic nickel particles embedded at finite
initial distance in a soft elastic polymeric gel matrix. Magnetization in an
external magnetic field tunes the magnetic attraction between the particles and
drives the process. We quantify the scenario by different theoretical tools,
i.e., explicit analytical calculations in the framework of linear elasticity
theory, a projection onto simplified dipole-spring models, as well as detailed
finite-element simulations. From these different approaches, we conclude that
in our case the cycle of virtual touching and detachment shows hysteretic
behavior due to the mutual magnetization between the paramagnetic particles.
Our results are important for the design and construction of reversibly tunable
mechanical damping devices. Moreover, our projection on dipole-spring models
allows the formal connection of our description to various related systems,
e.g., magnetosome filaments in magnetotactic bacteria.

Depending on their size, irregular particles are accurately characterized with
a 3D laser scanner or SEM micro-CT method. The experiments are carried out in
settling columns with height of 0.45 to 3.60m and in a 4m-high vertical wind
tunnel. In addition, $881$ additional experimental data points are also
considered that are compiled from the literature for particles of regular
shapes falling in liquids. New correlation is based on the particle Reynolds
number and two new shape descriptors defined as a function of particle
flatness, elongation and diameter. New shape descriptors are easy-to-measure
and can be more easily characterized than sphericity. The new correlation has
an average error of $\sim 10\%$, which is significantly lower than errors
associated with existing correlations. Additional aspects of particle
sedimentation is also investigated. First, it is found that particles falling
in dense liquids, in particular at $Re>1000$, tend to fall with their maximum
projection area perpendicular to their falling direction, whereas in gases
their orientation is random. Second, effects of small-scale surface
vesicularity and roughness on the drag coefficient of non-spherical particles
found to be $<10\%$. Finally, the effect of particle orientation on the drag

the end members of drag coefficient due to change in the particle orientation.

most evident when the applied field is not well oriented with respect to the

dynamical systems. A major limitation of the standard PF method is that the
dimensionality of the state space increases as the time proceeds and eventually
may cause degeneracy of the algorithm. A possible approach to alleviate the
degeneracy issue is to compute the marginal posterior distribution at each time
step, which leads to the so-called marginal PF method. A key issue in the
marginal PF method is to construct a good sampling distribution in the marginal
space. When the posterior distribution is close to Gaussian, the Ensemble
Kalman filter (EnKF) method can usually provide a good sampling distribution;
however the EnKF approximation may fail completely when the posterior is
strongly non-Gaussian. In this work we propose a defensive marginal PF (DMPF)
algorithm which constructs a sampling distribution in the marginal space by
combining the standard PF and the EnKF approximation using a multiple
importance sampling (MIS) scheme. An important feature of the proposed
algorithm is that it can automatically adjust the relative weight of the PF and
the EnKF components in the MIS scheme in each step, according to how
non-Gaussian the posterior is. With numerical examples we demonstrate that the
proposed method can perform well regardless of whether the posteriors can be
well approximated by Gaussian.

guaranteeing Galilean invariance by making use of a tensor basis. By modifying
a random forest algorithm to accept such a tensor basis, a robust, easy to

several flow cases using DNS/LES data, and used to predict the Reynolds stress
anisotropy tensor for new, unseen flows. The resulting predictions of
turbulence anisotropy are used as a turbulence model within a custom RANS

continuation method and a modified $k$-equation. Results are compared to the
neural network approach of Ling et al. [J. Fluid Mech, 807(2016):155-166,

anisotropy tensor for various flow cases, with realizable predictions close to
the DNS/LES reference data. Corresponding mean flows for a square duct flow
case and a backward facing step flow case show good agreement with DNS and

improved data-driven modelling of turbulence. This creates an opportunity to
generate custom turbulence closures for specific classes of flows, limited only

high-temperature industrial applications, but efficient use of a conventional
surface-based parabolic trough solar collector (SBPTSC) is limited by its high
radiation loss due to the high surface temperature. Recently, direct-absorption
parabolic trough solar collector (DAPTSC) using nanofluids has been proposed,
and its thermal efficiency has been reported to be 5-10$\%$ higher than the
conventional SBPTSC for inlet temperature up to 250$^\circ$C. However, the
inner tubes of the receivers of the existing DAPTSCs are all transparent, so
the sun rays entering the inner tube can only travel once through the
nanofluids. As a result, the optical path length for the sun rays is limited by
the inner tube size, which in turn requires high value of the absorption
coefficient of nanofluids. Due to the approximately linear relation between the
absorption coefficient and the particle concentration, higher absorption
coefficient is likely to cause particle agglomeration, leading to detrimental
effects on maintaining stable collector performance. In the current study, the
transparent DAPTSC is improved by applying a reflective coating on the upper
half of the inner tube outer surface, such that the optical path length is
doubled compared to the transparent DAPTSC; thus, the absorption coefficient of
the nanofluids can be reduced accordingly. The coated DAPTSC is found to have
obvious advantage compared to the transparent DAPTSC at absorption coefficient
below 0.5 cm$^{-1}$ for a receiver with inner tube diameter of 7 cm. In
addition, performance of the transparent DAPTSC, the coated DAPTSC and the
SBPTSC with black chrome coating have been compared to explore their
advantageous operation conditions, such as inner tube diameter, flow rate, and
inlet temperature, with or without a glass envelope for vacuum evacuation.

presence of a stochastic primordial magnetic field (PMF) whose strength is
spatially inhomogeneous. We assume a uniform total energy density and a
gaussian distribution of field strength. In this case, domains of different
temperatures exist in the BBN epoch due to variations in the local PMF. We show
that in such case, the effective distribution function of particle velocities
averaged over domains of different temperatures deviates from the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This deviation is related to the scale
invariant strength of the PMF energy density $\rho_{\rm Bc}$ and the
fluctuation parameter $\sigma_{\rm B}$. We perform BBN network calculations
taking into account the PMF strength distribution, and deduce the element
abundances as functions of the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, $\rho_{\rm Bc}$,
and $\sigma_{\rm B}$. We find that the fluctuations of the PMF reduces the
$^7$Be production and enhances D production. We analyze the averaged
thermonuclear reaction rates compared with those of a single temperature, and
find that the averaged charged-particle reaction rates are very different.
Finally, we constrain the parameters $\rho_{\rm Bc}$ and $\sigma_{\rm B}$ from
observed abundances of $^4$He and D, and find that the $^7$Li abundance is
significantly reduced. We also find that if the $\eta$ value during BBN was
larger than the present-day value due to a dissipation of the PMF or a
radiative decay of exotic particles after BBN or if the stellar depletion of
$^7$Li occurred, abundances of all light elements can be consistent with
observational constraints.

Naturally, paper citation pattern analysis is an efficient and essential way of
investigating the knowledge structure of science and technology. For decades,
it has been observed that citation of scientific literature follows a
heterogeneous and heavy-tailed distribution, and many of them suggest a
power-law distribution, log-normal distribution, and related distributions.
However, many studies are limited to small-scale approaches; therefore, it is
hard to generalize. To overcome this problem, we investigate 21 years of
citation evolution through a systematic analysis of the entire citation history
of 42,423,644 scientific literatures published from 1996 to 2016 and contained
in SCOPUS. We tested six candidate distributions for the scientific literature
in three distinct levels of Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) classification
scheme. First, we observe that the raw number of annual citation acquisitions
tends to follow the log-normal distribution for all disciplines, except for the
first year of the publication. We also find significant disparity between the
yearly acquired citation number among the journals, which suggests that it is
essential to remove the citation surplus inherited from the prestige of the
journals. Our simple method for separating the citation preference of an
individual article from the inherited citation of the journals reveals an
unexpected regularity in the normalized annual acquisitions of citations across
the entire field of science. Specifically, the normalized annual citation
acquisitions have power-law probability distributions with an exponential
cut-off of the exponents around 2.3, regardless of its publication and citation
year. Our results imply that journal reputation has a substantial long-term
impact on the citation.

method reduces the robot accumulative motion error by minimising robot turning

Recent experimental results offer new constraints on positronium or quarkonium

observability. Adopting conventional techniques like scan-chains open up
avenues for attacks, and hence cannot be adopted in a straight-forward manner
for security chips. Furthermore, testing becomes incredibly challenging for the
promising class of hardware security primitives, called PUFs, which offer
unique properties like unclonability, unpredictibility, uniformity, uniqueness,
and yet easily computable. However, the definition of PUF itself poses a
challenge on test engineers, simply because it has no golden response for a
given input, often called challenge. In this paper, we develop a novel test
strategy considering that the fabrication of a batch of $N>1$ PUFs is
equivalent to drawing random instances of Boolean mappings. We hence model the
PUFs as black-box Boolean functions of dimension $m\times1$, and show
combinatorially that random designs of such functions exhibit
correlation-spectra which can be used to characterize random and thus {\em
good} designs of PUFs. We first develop theoretical results to quantize the
correlation values, and subsequently the expected number of pairs of such
Boolean functions which should belong to a given spectra. In addition to this,
we show through extensive experimental results that a randomly chosen sample of
such PUFs also resemble the correlation-spectra property of the overall PUF
population. Interestingly, we show through experimental results on $50$ FPGAs
that when the PUFs are infected by faults the usual randomness tests for the
PUF outputs such as uniformity, fail to detect any aberration. However, the
spectral-pattern is clearly shown to get affected, which we demonstrate by
standard statistical tools. We finally propose a systematic testing framework
for the evaluation of PUFs by observing the correlation-spectra of the PUF
instances under test.

deep learning, recommender systems, etc., which can have millions or even
billions of parameters. Parallel algorithms have become an essential solution
technique to many large-scale machine learning jobs. In this paper, we propose
a model parallel proximal stochastic gradient algorithm, AsyB-ProxSGD, to deal
with large models using model parallel blockwise updates while in the meantime
handling a large amount of training data using proximal stochastic gradient
descent (ProxSGD). In our algorithm, worker nodes communicate with the
parameter servers asynchronously, and each worker performs proximal stochastic
gradient for only one block of model parameters during each iteration. Our
proposed algorithm generalizes ProxSGD to the asynchronous and model parallel
setting. We prove that AsyB-ProxSGD achieves a convergence rate of
$O(1/\sqrt{K})$ to stationary points for nonconvex problems under
\emph{constant} minibatch sizes, where $K$ is the total number of block
updates. This rate matches the best-known rates of convergence for a wide range
of gradient-like algorithms. Furthermore, we show that when the number of
workers is bounded by $O(K^{1/4})$, we can expect AsyB-ProxSGD to achieve
linear speedup as the number of workers increases. We implement the proposed
algorithm on MXNet and demonstrate its convergence behavior and near-linear
speedup on a real-world dataset involving both a large model size and large
amounts of data.

of integrable PDEs. In particular, Lax pairs for (1+1)-dimensional PDEs can be
interpreted as ZCRs. In [arXiv:1303.3575], for any (1+1)-dimensional scalar
evolution equation $E$, we defined a family of Lie algebras $F(E)$ which are
responsible for all ZCRs of $E$ in the following sense. Representations of the
algebras $F(E)$ classify all ZCRs of the equation $E$ up to local gauge
transformations. In [arXiv:1804.04652] we showed that, using these algebras,
one obtains necessary conditions for existence of a B\""acklund transformation
between two given equations. The algebras $F(E)$ are defined in terms of
generators and relations. In this paper we show that, using the algebras
$F(E)$, one obtains some necessary conditions for integrability of
(1+1)-dimensional scalar evolution PDEs, where integrability is understood in
the sense of soliton theory. Using these conditions, we prove non-integrability
for some scalar evolution PDEs of order $5$. Also, we prove a result announced
in [arXiv:1303.3575] on the structure of the algebras $F(E)$ for certain
classes of equations of orders $3$, $5$, $7$, which include KdV, mKdV,
Kaup-Kupershmidt, Sawada-Kotera type equations. Among the obtained algebras for
equations considered in this paper and in [arXiv:1804.04652], one finds
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of certain polynomial matrix-valued functions
on affine algebraic curves of genus $1$ and $0$. In this approach, ZCRs may
depend on partial derivatives of arbitrary order, which may be higher than the
order of the equation $E$. The algebras $F(E)$ generalize Wahlquist-Estabrook
prolongation algebras, which are responsible for a much smaller class of ZCRs.

Riemann solver and the subgrid-scale model in the prediction of a variety of

wall-bounded turbulence, are examined. Numerical and theoretical results show
the Riemann solver in the DG scheme plays the role of an implicit subgrid-scale
model and introduces numerical dissipation in under-resolved turbulent regions
of the flow. This implicit model behaves like a dynamic model and vanishes for
flows that do not contain subgrid scales, such as laminar flows, which is a
critical feature to accurately predict transition to turbulence. In addition,
for the moderate-Reynolds-number turbulence problems considered, the implicit
model provides a more accurate representation of the actual subgrid scales in
the flow than state-of-the-art explicit eddy viscosity models, including
dynamic Smagorinsky, WALE and Vreman. The results in this paper indicate new

retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scans from 2,312 eyes of 1,198 subjects. A
deep learning convolutional neural network was trained to assess optic disc
photographs and predict SDOCT average RNFL thickness. The performance of the
algorithm was evaluated in an independent test sample. The mean prediction of
average RNFL thickness from all 6,292 optic disc photos in the test set was
83.3$\pm$14.5 $\mu$m, whereas the mean average RNFL thickness from all
corresponding SDOCT scans was 82.5$\pm$16.8 $\mu$m (P = 0.164). There was a
very strong correlation between predicted and observed RNFL thickness values (r
= 0.832; P<0.001), with mean absolute error of the predictions of 7.39 $\mu$m.
The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for discriminating
glaucoma from healthy eyes with the deep learning predictions and actual SDOCT
measurements were 0.944 (95$\%$ CI: 0.912- 0.966) and 0.940 (95$\%$ CI: 0.902 -
0.966), respectively (P = 0.724). In conclusion, we introduced a novel deep

be used to diagnose and stage glaucomatous damage from optic disc photographs.

fluid flow on a granular bed. These bedforms are common in many environments,
existing under water or in air, and being formed from grains organized in
different initial arrangements. Although they are frequently found in nature
and industry, details about their development are still to be understood. In a
recent paper [C. A. Alvarez and E. M. Franklin, Phys. Rev. E 96, 062906
(2017)], we proposed a timescale for the development and equilibrium of single
barchans based on the growth of their horns. In the present Letter, we report
measurements of the growth of horns at the grain scale. In our experiments,
conical heaps were placed in a closed conduit and individual grains were
tracked as each heap, under the action of a water flow, evolved to a barchan
dune. We identified the trajectories of the grains that migrated to the growing
horns, and found that most of them came from upstream regions on the periphery
of the initial heap, with an average displacement of the order of the heap
size. In addition, we show that individual grains had transverse displacements
by rolling and sliding that are not negligible, with many of them going around
the heap. The mechanism of horns formation revealed by our experiments
contrasts with the general picture that barchan horns form from the advance of
the lateral dune flanks due to the scaling of migration velocity with the
inverse of dune size. Our results change the way in which the growth of
subaqueous barchan dunes is explained.

machine statistical inference and they are widely employed in Artificial
Intelligence as powerful tools for (deep) learning. However, in contrast with
countless remarkable practical successes, their mathematical formalization has
been largely elusive: from a statistical-mechanics perspective these systems
display the same (random) Gibbs measure of bi-partite spin-glasses, whose
rigorous treatment is notoriously difficult. In this work, beyond providing a
brief review on RBMs from both the learning and the retrieval perspectives, we
aim to contribute to their analytical investigation, by considering two
distinct realizations of their weights (i.e., Boolean and Gaussian) and
studying the properties of their related free energies. More precisely,
focusing on a RBM characterized by digital couplings, we first extend the
Pastur-Shcherbina-Tirozzi method (originally developed for the Hopfield model)
to prove the self-averaging property for the free energy, over its quenched
expectation, in the infinite volume limit, then we explicitly calculate its
simplest approximation, namely its annealed bound. Next, focusing on a RBM
characterized by analogical weights, we extend Guerra's interpolating scheme to
obtain a control of the quenched free-energy under the assumption of replica
symmetry: we get self-consistencies for the order parameters (in full agreement
with the existing Literature) as well as the critical line for ergodicity
breaking that turns out to be the same obtained in AGS theory. As we discuss,
this analogy stems from the slow-noise universality. Finally, glancing beyond
replica symmetry, we analyze the fluctuations of the overlaps for an estimate
of the (slow) noise affecting the retrieval of the signal, and by a stability
analysis we recover the Aizenman-Contucci identities typical of glassy systems.
