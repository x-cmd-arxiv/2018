its proton energy density exceeds a certain threshold. In this paper, we
investigate the temporal variability of hadronic systems in this hardly

prevent the system from reaching a steady state, but drive it instead in a
quasi-periodic mode. The escaping radiation then exhibits limit cycles, even if
all physical parameters are held constant in time. We extend our analysis to
cases where the proton injection rate varies with time and explore the
variability patterns of escaping radiation as the system moves in and out from
the supercritical regime. We examine the relevance of our results to the
variability of the prompt gamma-ray burst emission and show that, at least on a
phenomenological level, some interesting analogies exist.

of quantum telepor- tation. Earlier works in the literature focussed mainly on
two-mode non-Gaussian states generated by de-Gaussification of two-mode
squeezed vacuum states. In the current work, we study quan- tum teleportation
with a class of non-Gaussian entangled resource states that are generated at
the output of a passive beam splitter (BS) with different input single mode
non-Gaussian states. In particular, we consider input states that are generated
under successive application of squeezing and photon addition/subtraction
operations in various orders. We focus on identifying what attributes of the
resource states are necessary or sufficient for quantum teleportation (QT). To
this end we first evaluate two attributes considered in the literature, viz.
squeezed vacuum affinity (SVA) and EPR correlation. While SVA is not non-zero
for all two-mode resource states, EPR correlation is neither necessary nor
sufficient of QT. We consider yet another attribute, viz. two-mode quadrature
squeezing as defined by Simon et. al. [Phys. Rev. A 49, 1567 (1994)]. Our
numerical results on the de-Gaussified two-mode squeezed vacuum state as well
as the BS generated non-Gaussian states lead us to the conclusion that two-mode
quadrature squeezing is a necessary condition for QT, in general. We further
demonstrate the plausibility of this conclusion by giving an analytical proof
that two-mode quadrature squeezing is a necessary condition for QT in the case
of symmetric two-mode Gaussian resource states.

example, when estimating treatment effects in electronic health records (EHR)

effectively allows information from the predictive features to be safely
leveraged to improve efficiency in estimating the ATE. The estimator is
additionally doubly-robust in that it is consistent under correct specification

also locally semiparametric efficient under an ideal semi-supervised model

dissolution of uranium dioxide interfaces. Thin films of UO$_2$ deposited on
single crystal yttria stabilised zirconia substrates have been exposed to water
in the presence of a high flux, monochromatic, synchrotron x-ray source. In
particular, this technique was applied to induce dissolution of three UO$_2$
thin films, grown along the principle UO$_2$ crystallographic orientations:
(001), (110) and (111). Dissolution of each film was induced for 9 accumulative
corrosion periods, totalling 270s, after which XRR spectra were recorded to
observe the change in morphology of the films as a function of exposure time.
While the (001) and (110) oriented films were found to corrode almost linearly
and at comparable rates, the (111) film was found to be significantly more
corrosion resistant, with no loss of UO$_2$ material being observed after the
initial 90s corrosion period. These results distinctly show the effect of
crystallographic orientation on the rate of x-ray induced UO$_2$ dissolution.
This result may have important consequences for theoretical dissolution models,
as it is evident that orientation dependence must be taken into consideration
to obtain accurate predictions of the dissolution behaviour of UO$_2$.

equation that has been used to describe the velocity of microparticles in

properties of a Markovian approximation to the GLE in the presence of a wide
class of external potential wells. The qualitative behavior of the GLE is
largely determined by its memory kernel $K$, which summarizes the delayed
response of the fluid medium on the particles past movement. When $K$ can be
expressed as a finite sum of exponentials, it has been shown that long-term
time-averaged properties of the position and velocity do not depend on $K$ at
all. In certain applications, however, it is important to consider the GLE with
a power law memory kernel. Using the fact that infinite sums of exponentials
can have power law tails, we study the infinite-dimensional version of the
Markovian GLE in a potential well. In the case where the memory kernel $K$ is
integrable (i.e. in the asymptotically diffusive regime), we are able to extend
previous results and show that there is a unique stationary distribution for
the GLE system and that the long-term statistics of the position and velocity
do not depend on $K$. However, when $K$ is not integrable (i.e. in the
asymptotically subdiffusive regime), we are able to show the existence of an
invariant probability measure but uniqueness remains an open question. In
particular, the method of asymptotic coupling used in the integrable case to
show uniqueness does not apply when $K$ fails to be integrable.

asks for algorithmic verification of whether the model satisfies the
specification. We consider graphs and Markov decision processes (MDPs), which
are fundamental models for reactive systems. One of the very basic
specifications that arise in verification of reactive systems is the strong
fairness (aka Streett) objective. Given different types of requests and
corresponding grants, the objective requires that for each type, if the request
event happens infinitely often, then the corresponding grant event must also
happen infinitely often. All $\omega$-regular objectives can be expressed as
Streett objectives and hence they are canonical in verification. To handle the
state-space explosion, symbolic algorithms are required that operate on a
succinct implicit representation of the system rather than explicitly accessing
the system. While explicit algorithms for graphs and MDPs with Streett
objectives have been widely studied, there has been no improvement of the basic
symbolic algorithms. The worst-case numbers of symbolic steps required for the
basic symbolic algorithms are as follows: quadratic for graphs and cubic for
MDPs. In this work we present the first sub-quadratic symbolic algorithm for
graphs with Streett objectives, and our algorithm is sub-quadratic even for
MDPs. Based on our algorithmic insights we present an implementation of the new

concerns the classification of chromatic polynomials of graphs. Toward this
classification problem, one may ask for necessary inequalities among the
coefficients of a chromatic polynomial, and we contribute such inequalities
when a chromatic polynomial $\chi_G(n) = \chi^*_0 \binom {n+d} d + \chi^*_1
\binom {n+d-1} d + \dots + \chi^*_d \binom n d$ is written in terms of a

\chi^*_{ d-j }$, for $0 \le j \le \frac{ d }{ 2 }$. Similar results hold for
flow and tension polynomials enumerating either modular or integral
nowhere-zero flows/tensions of a graph. Our theorems follow from connections
among chromatic, flow, tension, and order polynomials, as well as Ehrhart
polynomials of lattice polytopes that admit unimodular triangulations. Our
results use Ehrhart inequalities due to Athanasiadis and Stapledon and are

be central to the future wireless networks. Common features of such services
include: a) their dependence on the human user's behavior and state, and b)
their need for more network resources compared to conventional cellular
applications. To successfully deploy such applications over wireless and
cellular systems, the network must be made cognizant of not only the
quality-of-service (QoS) needs of the applications, but also of the perceptions
of the human users on this QoS. In this paper, by explicitly modeling the
limitations of the human brain, a concrete measure for the delay perception of
human users in a wireless network is introduced. Then, a novel learning method,
called probability distribution identification, is proposed to find a
probabilistic model for this delay perception based on the brain features of a
human user. The proposed learning method uses both supervised and unsupervised
learning techniques to build a Gaussian mixture model of the human brain
features. Given a model for the delay perception of the human brain, a novel
brain-aware resource management algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization is
proposed for allocating radio resources to human users while minimizing the
transmit power and taking into account the reliability of both machine type
devices and human users. The proposed algorithm is shown to have a low
complexity. Moreover, a closed-form relationship between the reliability
measure and wireless physical layer metrics of the network is derived.
Simulation results using real data from actual human users show that a
brain-aware approach can yield savings of up to 78% in power compared to the
system

the cardinality constraint is a recurrent constraint that needs to be managed
effectively. Several efficient encodings have been proposed while missing that
such a constraint can be involved in a more general propositional formulation.
To avoid combinatorial explosion, Tseitin principle usually used to translate
such general propositional formula to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), introduces
fresh propositional variables to represent sub-formulas and/or complex
contraints. Thanks to Plaisted and Greenbaum improvement, the polarity of the
sub-formula $\Phi$ is taken into account leading to conditional constraints of
the form $y\rightarrow \Phi$, or $\Phi\rightarrow y$, where $y$ is a fresh
propositional variable. In the case where $\Phi$ represents a cardinality
constraint, such translation leads to conditional cardinality constraints
subject of the present paper. We first show that when all the clauses encoding
the cardinality constraint are augmented with an additional new variable, most
of the well-known encodings cease to maintain the generalized arc consistency
property. Then, we consider some of these encodings and show how they can be
extended to recover such important property. An experimental validation is
conducted on a SAT-based pattern mining application, where such conditional
cardinality constraints is a cornerstone, showing the relevance of our proposed

number of distinct blocks of length $n$ appearing in $S_{a,b}$. In our main
result we determine $p_{a,b}(n)$ for all squarefree bases $b\ge 5$ and all

$1<a<b$ for which $p_{a,b}(n)$ is not of the above form.
  We use this result to obtain sharp upper and lower bounds for $p_{a,b}(n)$,

convolutional spiking neural network (DCSNN) and a latency-coding scheme. We
trained it using a combination of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for
the lower layers and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) for the higher ones. In
short, with R-STDP a correct (resp. incorrect) decision leads to STDP (resp.
anti-STDP). This approach led to an accuracy of $97.2\%$ on MNIST, without
requiring an external classifier. In addition, we demonstrated that R-STDP
extracts features that are diagnostic for the task at hand, and discards the
other ones, whereas STDP extracts any feature that repeats. Finally, our
approach is biologically plausible, hardware friendly, and energy-efficient.

as a network. Two prominent paradigms for modeling networks are statistical
models (probabilistic models for the observed network) and mechanistic models
(models for network growth and/or evolution). Mechanistic models are better
suited for incorporating domain knowledge, to study effects of interventions
(such as changes to specific mechanisms) and to forward simulate, but they
typically have intractable likelihoods. As such, and in a stark contrast to
statistical models, there is a relative dearth of research on model selection
for such models despite the otherwise large body of extant work. In this paper,
we propose a simulator-based procedure for mechanistic network model selection
that borrows aspects from Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) along with a
means to quantify the uncertainty in the selected model. To select the most
suitable network model, we consider and assess the performance of several
learning algorithms, most notably the so-called Super Learner, which makes our
framework less sensitive to the choice of a particular learning algorithm. Our
approach takes advantage of the ease to forward simulate from mechanistic
network models to circumvent their intractable likelihoods. The overall process
is flexible and widely applicable. Our simulation results demonstrate the
approach's ability to accurately discriminate between competing mechanistic
models. Finally, we showcase our approach with a protein-protein interaction
network model from the literature for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

possibility of this being an important feature of the processes by which the

is sufficient to support the existence of an influential observer and to offer

from different references. For each probe image, the gallery image with the
highest matching score is the re-identifying result. Compared to existing
algorithms, our GCT can handle spatial misalignment caused by large variations
in view angles and human poses owing to the benefits of patch-wise graph

nodes emerge in pairs of opposite chirality and can be seen as either a source

surface Fermi arcs and the chiral anomaly, make them a new playground for
exploring novel functionalities. Further exploiting their potential
applications requires clear understanding of their topological electronic
properties, such as Weyl points and Fermi arcs. Here we report a Fourier
transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (FT-STS) study on a type-II Weyl
semimetal candidate MoTe$_2$ whose Weyl points are predicated to be located
above Fermi level. Although its electronic structure below the Fermi level have
been identified by angle resolved photo emission spectroscopy (ARPES), by
comparing our experimental data with first-principles calculations, we are able
to identify the origins of the multiple scattering channels at energies both
below and above Fermi level. Our calculations also show the existence of both
trivial and topological arc like states above the Fermi energy. In the FT-STS
experiments, we have observed strong signals from intra-arc scatterings as well
as from the scattering between the arc-like surface states and the projected
bulk states. A detailed comparison between our experimental observations and
calculated results reveals the trivial and non-trivial scattering channels are
difficult to distinguish in this compound. Interestingly, we find that the

intrinsic magnetoresistance for three-dimensional Dirac fermions at a finite

longitudinal magnetoresistance is negative and quadratic of a weak field B
while the in-plane transverse magnetoresistance is positive and quadratic of B.
The relative magnetoresistance is inversely quartic of the Fermi wave vector
and only determined by the density of charge carriers, irrelevant to the
external scatterings in the weak scattering limit. This intrinsic anisotropic
magnetoresistance is measurable in systems with lower carrier density and high

to introduce synthesized training data, so that the dataset size can be

problem in active vision: given an {\bf infinite} data space, how to
effectively sample a {\bf finite} subset to train a visual classifier? This
paper presents an approach for learning from synthesized data effectively. The
motivation is straightforward -- increasing the probability of seeing difficult
training data. We introduce a module named {\bf SampleAhead} to formulate the
learning process into an online communication between a {\em classifier} and a
{\em sampler}, and update them iteratively. In each round, we adjust the
sampling distribution according to the classification results, and train the
classifier using the data sampled from the updated distribution. Experiments
are performed by introducing synthesized images rendered from ShapeNet models
to assist PASCAL3D+ classification. Our approach enjoys higher classification
accuracy, especially in the scenario of a limited number of training samples.
This demonstrates its efficiency in exploring the infinite data space.

The proposed primary control architecture is evaluated with distributed

change was also observed in the temperature range of 60-120 K. Additionally a
large relative cooling power also observed in this compound. The observed value
is comparable to those of promising refrigerant material in this temperature

with spin-orbit coupling proposed in Ref. [{\emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.}
\textbf{119}, 267001 (2017)}] is used to describe the FeSe superconductor. In
the strong coupling regime, two impurity resonance peaks appear with opposite
resonance energies in the LDOS spectral function. For a strong spin-orbit
coupling, the superconducting gap in this model is $d$-wave symmetric with
nodes, the spatial distributions of the LDOS at the two resonance energies are
fourfold symmetric, which reveals typical characteristic of $d$-wave pairing.
When the spin-orbit coupling is not strong enough to close the superconducting
gap, we find that the spatial distribution of the LDOS at one of the resonance
energies manifests $s$-wave symmetry, while the pairing potential preserves
$d$-wave symmetry. This result is consistent with previous experimental
investigations.

become an indispensable dispute on developing a clear understanding about the
attacks in order to have an operative protection mechanism. Present attack
categorization techniques protect a specific group of threat which has either
messed the entire taxonomy structure or ambiguous when one network attacks get
blended with few others attacks. Hence, this raises concerns about developing a
common and general purpose taxonomy. In this study, a sequential
question-answer based model of categorization is proposed. In this article, an
intrusion detection framework and threat grouping schema are proposed on the
basis of four sequential questions (Who, Where, How and What). We have used our
method for classifying traditional network attacks in order to identify
initiator, source, attack style and seriousness of an attack. Another focus of
the paper is to provide a preventive list of actions for network administrator
as a guideline to reduce overall attack consequence. Recommended taxonomy is
designed to detect common attacks rather than any particular type of attack
which can have a practical effect in real life attack classification. From the
analysis of the classifications obtained from few infamous attacks, it is
obvious that the proposed system holds certain benefits related to the
prevailing taxonomies. Future research directions have also been well

use new observations made with Chandra and XMM-Newton, and an archival NuSTAR
observation which add flux measurements at ~2000 days into quiescence after the
2008 outburst. We find that the source flux has further declined since the last
measurement made in 2011, ~1000 days after the outburst in 2008. This trend is
similar to the relaxation after the source's 1998 outburst. We use crustal
cooling models to reproduce the flux relaxation; if the whole surface of the
star is heated in the outbursts, the modeling suggests that the 2008 outburst
of SGR 1627-41 deposited energy into the inner crust and that the core
temperature of SGR 1627-41 is low (T_c<10^8 K) as previously suggested. On the
other hand, if only a small fraction of the surface is heated or the
temperature in the crust reached the melting temperature, relaxation at early
times requires another emission mechanism. Finally, we report on evidence for
hard X-ray emission in SGR 1627-41 which follows the observational correlation
suggested by Kaspi & Boydstun (2010) in magnetars.

framework of Double Focus Point (DFP) supersymmetry. The bileptino is a copy of
higgsino whose partner, bilepton, is used to break $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry
spontaneously. Such scenario, however, is not favored by direct detection since
it leads to unacceptable spin-independent cross section when one requires
correct self-scattering cross section. We point out that is not necessarily the
case even in the presence of light $Z^{\prime}$. The right-handed sneutrino in
this model acts as LSP in most of parameter space for non-vanishing soft
trilinear coupling $T_{\eta}$. It is thus consistent of the requirement of DFP
SUSY without involving any direct detection issue. The corrected relic
abundance could be achieved via sneutrino annihilate into pair of bilepton
which also serve as light mediator in Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM).
Moreover, stringent constraint comes from CMB anisotropies can be evaded by
considering retarded decay of right-handed neutrinos. We further stress the
need for a large soft trilinear term $T_{\eta}$ in order to generate desirable
self-scattering cross section $\sigma/m_{\tilde\nu_R}$ with moderate Yukawa
coupling $Y_{\eta}$. The numerical calculation illustrates that SIDM is
reliable in our model from the scales of dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster.

shown that, under certain additional hypotheses on the system of cosets, each

forcing. The estimated magnitude of the total solar irradiance difference
between Maunder minimum and present time ranges from 0.1 to 6 W/m2 making
uncertain the simulation of the past and future climate. One reason for this
disagreement is the applied evolution of the quiet Sun brightness in the solar
irradiance reconstruction models. This work addresses the role of the quiet Sun
model choice and updated solar magnetic activity proxies on the solar forcing
reconstruction. Aims. We aim to establish a plausible range of the solar
irradiance variability on decadal to millennial time scales. Methods. The
spectral solar irradiance (SSI) is calculated as a weighted sum of the
contributions from sunspot umbra/penumbra, fac- ulae and quiet Sun, which are
pre-calculated with the spectral synthesis code NESSY. We introduce activity
belts of the contributions from sunspots and faculae and a new structure model
for the quietest state of the Sun. We assume that the brightness of the quiet
Sun varies in time proportionally to the secular (22-year smoothed) variation
of the solar modulation potential. Results. A new reconstruction of the TSI and
SSI covering the period 6000 BCE - 2015 CE is presented. The model simulates
solar irradiance variability during the satellite era well. The TSI change

Unlike traditional vector input, a graph has rich variable-size substructures

We introduce GAML (Graph Attentional Multi-Label learning), a novel graph

auxiliary nodes and models them in conjunction with the input graph. By
applying message passing and attention mechanisms to both the label nodes and
the input nodes iteratively, GAML can capture the relations between the labels

take advantage of explicit label dependencies. It also scales linearly with the
number of labels and graph size thanks to our proposed hierarchical attention.
We evaluate GAML on an extensive set of experiments with both graph-structured

significantly outperforms other competing methods. Importantly, GAML enables
intuitive visualizations for better understanding of the label-substructure

During the first stage $^{229}$Th nuclei were excited with the inverse internal
conversion to the low-lying isomeric level in plasma that was formed by laser
pulse at the $^{229}$Th-containing target surface. Then thorium ions having
excited nuclei were extracted from the plasma by an external electrical field
and implanted into thin SiO$_2$ film grown on a silicon substrate (that is a
dielectric material with about 9 eV band-gap). Gamma decay of isomeric nuclei
was registered during the second stage by the general methods of the electron
spectroscopy after the photon-electron emission from the silicon substrate.
Substitution of the photon registration with the electron one allowed us to
increase the desired signal by several orders of magnitude and detect the
$^{229}$Th nuclei decay. During the third stage the electron spectra from
standard Xe VUV source was obtained that allowed determining the energy of
photons. In order to prove that the detected signal is caused by isomeric
$^{229}$Th nuclei decay a series of experiments was carried. The analysis of
electron spectra gives the following results: the energy of the nuclear
transition is $E_{\text{is}}=7.1(^{+0.1}_{-0.2})$~eV, the half-life of the
isomeric level in bare nucleus in vacuum is $T_{1/2}=1880\pm170$~s, the reduced

have strong incentives to manipulate the results and models generated by

study of poisoning attacks and their countermeasures for linear regression
models. In poisoning attacks, attackers deliberately influence the training
data to manipulate the results of a predictive model. We propose a
theoretically-grounded optimization framework specifically designed for linear
regression and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of datasets and models.
We also introduce a fast statistical attack that requires limited knowledge of
the training process. Finally, we design a new principled defense method that
is highly resilient against all poisoning attacks. We provide formal guarantees
about its convergence and an upper bound on the effect of poisoning attacks
when the defense is deployed. We evaluate extensively our attacks and defenses
on three realistic datasets from health care, loan assessment, and real estate
domains.

managerial function, typically involving several objectives and a variety of
idiosyncratic practical constraints. Despite the prevalence of this task in
practice, the process is seldom approached as a precise optimization problem
over the reported preferences of all agents. This is due in part to the
underlying computational complexity that occurs when quadratic (i.e.,
intra-team interpersonal) interactions are taken into consideration, and also
due to game-theoretic considerations, when those taking part in the process are
self-interested agents. Variants of this fundamental decision problem arise in
a number of settings, including, for example, human resources and project
management, military platooning, sports-league management, ride sharing, data
clustering, and in assigning students to group projects. In this paper, we
study a mathematical-programming approach to ""team formation"" focused on the
interplay between two of the most common objectives considered in the related
literature: economic efficiency (i.e., the maximization of social welfare) and
game-theoretic stability (e.g., finding a core solution when one exists). With
a weighted objective across these two goals, the problem is modeled as a
bi-level binary optimization problem, and transformed into a single-level,
exponentially sized binary integer program. We then devise a
branch-cut-and-price algorithms and demonstrate its efficacy through an
extensive set of simulations, with favorable comparisons to other algorithms
from the literature.

between two half spaces occupied by fluid-like media, lends itself to a
rigorous theoretical analysis of its response to an acoustic homogeneous plane
wave. This theory gives rise to two sets of linear equations, the first for the
amplitudes of the waves in the space between successive blocks, and the second
for the amplitudes of the waves in the two half spaces. The first set is solved
numerically to furnish reference solutions. The second set is submitted to
low-frequency approximation procedure whereby the pressure fields are found to
be those for a configuration in which the grating becomes a homogeneous layer
of the same thickness as the height of the blocks in the grating. A simple
formula is derived for the constitutive properties of this layer in terms of
those of the fluid-like medium in between the blocks. The homogeneous layer
model scattering amplitude transfer functions and spectral reflectance,
transmittance and absorptance reproduce quite well the corresponding rigorous
numerical functions of the grating over a non-negligible range of low
frequencies. Due to its simplicity, the homogeneous layer model enables
theoretical predictions of many of the key features of the acoustic response of
the grating.

20th century, aims to reconstruct quantum mechanics (QM) from a more
fundamental theory of classical point particles interacting with a
classical-like ether, where said interaction causes the particles to undergo a
diffusion process that conserves their average total energy. However, Timothy
Wallstrom and others have emphasized that SM runs into the problem that it
cannot recover the Schroedinger equation of QM unless an ad hoc quantization
condition is assumed. In this thesis, I reformulate SM so that the quantization
condition arises as a natural consequence of the classical point particles
interacting with the classical-like ether. This is done by combining SM with a
proposal by Louis de Broglie and David Bohm, in which an elementary particle in
its rest frame is viewed as a localized periodic phenomenon of fixed frequency,
from which it follows that the phase of the periodic phenomenon in the lab
frame satisfies a relation that's equivalent to the quantization condition. In
doing so, I argue that SM can once again be regarded as a viable approach to
reconstructing QM. In addition, I show that SM yields novel and empirically
viable models of semiclassical Newtonian gravity and electrodynamics, simply by
incorporating classical Newtonian gravitational and electrostatic interactions
between the particles. I also show how the Schroedinger-Newton equation and the
Schroedinger-Coulomb equation arise as mean-field approximations from within
these SM models of semiclassical Newtonian gravity and electrodynamics, and how
classical Newtonian gravity can be recovered from an appropriate center-of-mass
description of many interacting SM particles. Finally, I argue that SM has
distinct advantages over the standard and other heterodox approaches to
combining quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity semiclassically.

light transmission in a photonic crystal device, made by alternating layers of
silver nanoparticles and titanium dioxide nanoparticles. We show a shift of
around 10 nm for an applied voltage of 10 V. We ascribe the shift to an
accumulation of charges at the silver/TiO2 interface due to electric field,
resulting in an increase of the number of charges contributing to the plasma
frequency in silver, giving rise to a blue shift of the silver plasmon band,
with concomitant blue shift of the photonic band gap. The employment of a
relatively low applied voltage gives the possibility to build a compact and
low-cost device. We also propose the fabrication of 1D photonic crystal and
microcavities employing a magneto-optical material as TGG (Tb3Ga5O12). With
these structures we can observe a shift of 22 nm with a magnetic field of 5 T,
at low temperature (8 K). The option to tune the colour of a photonic crystal
