processes, which perform the regularization of the---in general highly
singular---Glauber-Sudarshan $P$~functions of arbitrary quantum states before
their application and/or measurement. This allows us to produce a broad class
of nonclassical states with regular $P$~functions, also called nonclassicality
quasiprobabilities. For this purpose, the input states are combined on highly
transmissive beam splitters with specific Gaussian or non-Gaussian classical
states. We study both balanced and unbalanced homodyne detections for the
direct sampling of the output states of the implemented processes, which
requires no further regularization or state-reconstruction. By numerical
simulations we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and we outline the
generalization to multimode light.

based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb$^{-1}$. The measurements are performed
in the lepton+jets decay channels with a single muon or electron and jets in
the final state. The differential cross sections are presented at the particle
level, within a phase space close to the experimental acceptance, and at the
parton level in the full phase space. The results are compared to several
standard model predictions that use different methods and approximations. The
kinematic variables of the top quarks and the $\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$
system are reasonably described in general, though none predict all the
measured distributions. In particular, the transverse momentum distribution of
the top quarks is more steeply falling than predicted. The kinematic
distributions and multiplicities of jets are adequately modeled by certain
combinations of next-to-leading-order calculations and parton shower models.

triproducts that appear in conformal field theory correlation functions, to
describe a consistent treatment of nonassociative quantum mechanics, to
demonstrate quantitatively the coarse-graining of spacetime due to $R$-flux,

bosonic quantum gases that are coupled both to a thermal heat bath and to a
pumped reservoir (or gain medium), while suffering from loss. Such a scenario
describes photonic many-body systems such as exciton-polariton gases. Our
analysis is based on a set of kinetic equations for a gas of noninteracting
bosons. By identifying a dimensionless scaling parameter controlling the boson
density, we derive a sharp criterion for which system states become selected to
host a macroscopic occupation. We show that with increasing pump power, the
system generically undergoes a sequence of nonequilibrum phase transitions. At
each transition a state either becomes or ceases to be Bose selected (i.e. to
host a condensate): The state which first acquires a condensate when the
pumping exceeds a threshold is the one with the largest ratio of pumping to
loss. This intuitive behavior resembles simple lasing. In the limit of strong
pumping, the coupling to the heat bath becomes dominant so that eventually the
ground state is selected, corresponding to equilibrium(-like) Bose
condensation. For intermediate pumping strengths, several states become
selected giving rise to fragmented nonequilibrium Bose condensation. We compare
these predictions to experimental results obtained for excitons polaritons in a
double-pillar structure [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 126403 (2012)] and find good
agreement. Our theory, moreover, predicts that the reservoir occupation is
clamped at a constant value whenever the system hosts an odd number of Bose

radiative shifts, while the dark bands are essentially unaffected by the

logarithmic singularity where the quasistatic spectrum intersects the light

saturating in the strong superconducting regime. The same behavior is displayed
by the bipartite entanglement between the set of all single particle states $k$

a properly defined fermionic concurrence, exhibits a different behavior,
showing a peak in the vicinity of the superconducting transition for states
$k,k'$ close to the fermi level and becoming small in the strong coupling

complex, temporally extended social dilemmas. Models based on behavioral
economics are only able to explain this phenomenon for unrealistic stateless
matrix games. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been applied to
generalize social dilemma problems to temporally and spatially extended Markov
games. However, this has not yet generated an agent that learns to cooperate in
social dilemmas as humans do. A key insight is that many, but not all, human
individuals have inequity averse social preferences. This promotes a particular
resolution of the matrix game social dilemma wherein inequity-averse
individuals are personally pro-social and punish defectors. Here we extend this
idea to Markov games and show that it promotes cooperation in several types of
sequential social dilemma, via a profitable interaction with policy
learnability. In particular, we find that inequity aversion improves temporal
credit assignment for the important class of intertemporal social dilemmas.
These results help explain how large-scale cooperation may emerge and persist.

of the confinement, we demonstrate the existence of a complex reentrant phase
behavior, including isotropic liquid and liquid-crystal-like phases with
different symmetries. We show how these changes impact the relative
organization of the ions, with substantial modifications of the Coulombic

decoupling of the dynamics of the counterions, pointing to very different roles
played by these in charge transport under confinement. We finally discuss our

ratio of the number of lasso-shaped words of length n that satisfy the property
to the total number of lasso-shaped words of length n. We investigate the
problem of computing the density for both linear-time properties in general and
for the important special case of omega-regular properties. For general
linear-time properties, the density is not necessarily convergent and can
oscillate indefinitely for certain properties. However, we show the oscillation
can be bounded by the growth of the sets of bad- and good-prefix of the

incommensurate spin correlations in doped and spin-imbalanced Hubbard chains
using fully spin and density resolved quantum gas microscopy. Doping is found
to induce a linear change of the spin-density wave vector in excellent
agreement with Luttinger theory predictions. For non-zero polarization we
observe a decrease of the wave vector with magnetization as expected from the
Heisenberg model in a magnetic field. We trace the microscopic origin of these
incommensurate correlations to holes, doublons and excess spins which act as
delocalized domain walls for the antiferromagnetic order. Finally, when

scales, and this makes them difficult to simulate numerically. Here, we propose
that their statistical properties can be derived within a simplified
time-independent co-ordinate system of cloud number $n$, saturated static
energy $h^\star$, and cloud perimeter $\lambda$. Under the constraint that
circulations around cloud edge compete for buoyant energy and air, we show that
the product of cloud number and cloud perimeter $n\lambda$ is invariant with
$\lambda$ and that cloud number follows a negative exponential with respect to
cloud-edge deviations of $h^\star$ from the mean. Overall, the summed perimeter
of all clouds scales as the square root of the atmospheric static stability,
which suggests that the complexity of cloud field structures can be viewed
statistically as an emergent property of atmospheric bulk thermodynamics.
Analytically derived conclusions are compared with a detailed tropical cloud
field simulation and found generally to agree to within $<$13%. For the sake of
developing hypotheses about cloud temporal evolution that are testable in high
resolution simulations, the shapes of tropical cloud perimeter distributions
are predicted to be invariant as climate warms, although with a modest increase
in total cloud amount.

entire functions of rapid decay in certain (including Euclidean) directions
ensuring UV finiteness but are necessarily of rapid increase in others. A
parametric representation is obtained by integrating out the loop (Euclidean)
momenta after the introduction of generalized Schwinger parameters. Either in
the original or parametric representation, the well-defined resulting
amplitudes are then continued in the complex space of the external momenta
invariants. We obtain the alternative forms of the Landau equations determining
the singularity surfaces showing that the nonlocal vertices serve as UV
regulators but do not affect the local singularity structure. As a result the
full set of singularities known to occur in local field theory also occurs
here: normal and anomalous thresholds as well as acnodes, crunodes, and cusps
that may under certain circumstances appear even on the physical sheet.
Singularities of the second type also appear as shown from the parametric
representation. We obtain the general Cutkosky discontinuity rule for
encircling a singularity by employing contour deformations only in the finite

very high confidence, we detect an increase in the strength of the
teleconnection, as a response to the forcing, in the MPI-ESM under historical
forcing between 1890 and 2005, concentrated to the end of this period. We
explain that our finding does not contradict instrumental observations, since
their existing analyses regarding the nonstationarity of the teleconnection are
either methodologically unreliable, or consider an ill-defined teleconnection
concept. In the MPI-ESM we cannot reject stationarity between 2006 and 2099

110-year-long 1-percent pure CO2 scenario; neither can we in the CESM between

the climatic mean is strongly displaced in the phase space projection spanned
by the two variables. This displacement is nevertheless linear. However, the
slope exhibits a strong seasonality, falsifying a hypothesis of a universal,
emergent relationship between these two climatic means, excluding applicability

phenomenon with numerous applications in biopreservation and beyond. Under
normal conditions, heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms critically prohibit the
simultaneous long-term (> 1 week), large volume (> 1 ml) and low temperatures
(< -10 oC) supercooling of aqueous solutions. Here, in order to overcome this
bottleneck and enable novel and practical supercooling applications, we report
on the use of surface sealing of water by an oil phase to drastically diminish
the primary heterogeneous nucleation at the water/air interface. Using this
approach, we have achieved deep supercooling (as low as -20 oC) of
large-volumes of water (up to 100 ml) for long periods (as long as 100 days)
simultaneously. Since oils are mixtures of various hydrocarbons we also report
on the use of pure alkanes and primary alcohols of various lengths to achieve
the same. All alcohols and some of the longer alkane chains we studied show
high capacity to inhibit freezing. The relationship of this capacity with the
chain length, however, shows opposite trends for alcohols and alkanes due to
their drastically different interfacial structures with the water molecules. We
find that the deeply supercooled water (at -20 oC) can withstand vibrational
and thermal disturbances with all sealing liquids used, and even an extreme
disturbance, ultrasonication, when alcohols are used as the sealing phase. The
deep supercooling approach we developed here, for large samples and long
periods, is expected to enable novel applications of supercooling in a variety
of areas including biopreservation and food storage among others.

galaxies. While it originates from many physical processes, for star-forming
galaxies the intrinsic Lya luminosity is a direct tracer of the Lyman-continuum
(LyC) radiation produced by the most massive O- and early-type B-stars with
lifetimes of a few Myrs. As such, Lya luminosity should be an excellent
instantaneous star formation rate (SFR) indicator. However, its resonant nature
and susceptibility to dust as a rest-frame UV photon makes Lya very hard to
interpret due to the uncertain Lya escape fraction, f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$. Here we
explore results from the CALYMHA survey at z=2.2, follow-up of Lya emitters
(LAEs) at z=2.2-2.6 and a z~0-0.3 compilation of LAEs to directly measure
f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$ with H-alpha (Ha). We derive a simple empirical relation
that robustly retrieves f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$ as a function of Lya rest-frame EW
(EW$_0$): f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$= 0.0048 EW$_0$[A]$\pm0.05$ and we show that it
constrains a well-defined anti-correlation between ionisation efficiency and
dust extinction in LAEs. Observed Lya luminosities and EW$_0$ are easy
measurable quantities at high redshift, thus making our relation a practical
tool to estimate intrinsic Lya and LyC luminosities under well controlled and
simple assumptions. Our results allow observed Lya luminosities to be used to
compute SFRs for LAEs at z~0-2.6 within 0.2 dex of the Ha dust corrected SFRs.
We apply our empirical SFR(Lya,EW$_0$) calibration to several sources at z>2.6
to find that star-forming LAEs have SFRs typically ranging from 0.1 to 20
M$_{\odot}$/yr and that our calibration might be even applicable for the most
luminous LAEs within the epoch of re-ionisation. Our results imply high
ionisation efficiencies and low dust content in LAEs across cosmic time, and
will be easily tested with future observations with JWST.

Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on galaxy images. We test the method using
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) r-band images with artificial AGN point sources

GALFIT. When the AGN point source PS is more than twice as bright as the host

PSFGAN is more tolerant to poor knowledge of the PSF than parametric methods.
Our tests show that PSFGAN is robust against a broadening in the PSF width of
$\pm 50\%$ if it is trained on multiple PSF's. We demonstrate that while a
matched training set does improve performance, we can still subtract point
sources using a PSFGAN trained on non-astronomical images. While initial
training is computationally expensive, evaluating PSFGAN on data is more than
$40$ times faster than GALFIT fitting two components. Finally, PSFGAN it is
more robust and easy to use than parametric methods as it requires no input

extract a significant fraction of the accretion energy, sharply peaked towards
small disc radii $R$ (as $R^{-17/2}$ for fields with constant equipartition
ratio). This low-frequency emission is immediately absorbed by surrounding
matter or refracted towards the regions of lowest density. The resultant
mechanical pressure, dipole angular pattern, and much lower matter density
towards the rotational poles create a strong tendency to drive jets along the
black hole spin axis, similar to the spin-axis jets of radio pulsars, also
strong dipole emitters. The coherent primary emission may explain the high
brightness temperatures seen in jets. The intrinsic disc emission is modulated
at Lense-Thirring frequencies near the inner edge, providing a physical
mechanism for low-frequency QPOs.
  Dipole emission requires nonzero hole spin, but uses only disc accretion
energy. No spin energy is extracted, unlike the Blandford-Znajek process.
MHD/GRMHD formulations do not directly give radiation fields, but can be
checked post-process for dipole emission and so self-consistency, given
sufficient resolution. Jets driven by dipole radiation should be more common in
AGN than in X-ray binaries, and in low accretion rate states than high,
agreeing with observation. In non-black-hole accretion, misaligned disc annuli
precess because of the accretor's mass quadrupole moment, similarly producing
jets and QPOs.

photometry, based on a technique presented in Green et al. 2014; Green et al.

a CO spectral cube as dust templates and modeling the cumulative distribution
of dust along the line of sight towards these stars as a linear combination of
the emission in the slices. Using a nested sampling algorithm, we fit these
per-star distance-reddening measurements to find the distances to the CO
velocity slices towards each star-forming region. This results in distance
estimates explicitly tied to the velocity structure of the molecular gas. We
determine distances to the B5, IC348, B1, NGC1333, L1448, and L1451
star-forming regions and find that individual clouds are located between

find that the velocity gradient across Perseus corresponds to a distance
gradient of about 25 pc, with the eastern portion of the cloud farther away
than the western portion. We determine an average distance to the complex of
$294\pm 17$ pc, about 60 pc higher than the distance derived to the western
portion of the cloud using parallax measurements of water masers associated
with young stellar objects. The method we present is not limited to the Perseus

consistent with a model in which the scatter in Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity near $z

attributing the act of cutting and removing a ring to the operation of tracing
out the particle, and associating linked rings to entangled particles. This
analogy naturally leads us to a classification of multipartite quantum
entanglement based on all possible distinct links for a given number of rings.
To determine all different possibilities, we develop a formalism which
associates any link to a polynomial, with each polynomial thereby defining a
distinct equivalence class. In order to demonstrate the use of this
classification scheme, we choose qubit quantum states as our example of
physical system. A possible procedure to obtain qubit states from the
polynomials is also introduced, providing an example state for each link class.

behaviour of its microscopic constituents is an open question at the heart of
the foundations of quantum mechanics. Quantum Darwinism and spectrum broadcast
structure are two different frameworks providing key insight into this
question. Recent works, however, indicate these two frameworks can lead to
conflicting predictions on the objectivity of the state of a system interacting
with an environment. Here we provide a resolution to this issue by defining
strong quantum Darwinism and proving that it is equivalent to spectrum
broadcast structure when combined with strong independence of the
subenvironments. We further show that strong quantum Darwinism is sufficient
and necessary to signal state objectivity without the requirement of strong
independence. Our work unveils the deep connection between strong quantum
Darwinism and spectrum broadcast structure, thereby making fundamental progress
towards understanding and solving the emergence of classicality from the
quantum world. Together they provide us a sharper understanding of the
transition in terms of state structure, geometry, and quantum and classical
information.

by using an artificial neural network to obtain counts of objects in CCTV

as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves propagate both across and along the magnetic
field. These waves are most likely a combination of resonantly coupled fast
magnetoacoustic waves and Alfv\'en waves. The coupling results in resonant
absorption of the fast waves, converting fast wave energy into Alfv\'en waves.
The fast eigenmodes of the arcade have proven difficult to compute or derive
analytically, largely because of the mathematical complexity that the coupling
introduces. When a traditional spectral decomposition is employed, the discrete
spectrum associated with the fast eigenmodes is often subsumed into the
continuous Alfv\'en spectrum. Thus fast eigenmodes, become collective modes or
quasi-modes. Here we present a spectral decomposition that treats the
eigenmodes as having real frequencies but complex wavenumbers. Using this
procedure we derive dispersion relations, spatial damping rates, and
eigenfunctions for the resonant, fast eigenmodes of the arcade. We demonstrate
that resonant absorption introduces a fast mode that would not exist otherwise.
This new mode is heavily damped by resonant absorption, only travelling a few
wavelengths before losing most of its energy.

extrapolated to R200, the gas mass is comparable to the stellar mass, but about
half of the baryons are still missing from the hot phase. If extrapolated to
1.9-3 R200, the baryon to dark matter ratio approaches the cosmic value.
Significantly flatter density profiles are unlikely for R < 50 kpc and they are
disfavored but not ruled out for R > 50 kpc. For the Milky Way, the hot halo
metallicity lies in the range 0.3-1 solar for R < 50 kpc. Planck measurements
of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect toward stacked luminous galaxies
(primarily early-type) indicate that most of their baryons are hot, near the
virial temperature, and extend beyond R200. This stacked SZ signal is nearly an
order of magnitude larger than that inferred from the X-ray observations of
individual (mostly spiral) galaxies with M_* > 10^11.3 Msun. This difference
suggests that the hot halo properties are distinct for early and late type
galaxies, possibly due to different evolutionary histories. For the cooler gas
detected in UV absorption line studies, we argue that there are two absorption
populations: extended halos; and disks extending to ~50 kpc, containing most of
this gas, and with masses a few times lower than the stellar masses. Such
extended disks are also seen in 21 cm HI observations and in simulations.

no nearest-neighbor triangle has all three particles in the same layer. (b) At

strongly correlated crystals of composite fermions; a theory incorporating only
electron Hartree-Fock crystals does not find any crystals besides the `trivial'
ones occurring at large interlayer separations for total filling factor
$\nu\leq1/3$ (when layers are uncorrelated and each layer is in the long

several varieties, with different flavors of composite fermions and different

by shifting the focus towards \textit{users}. We develop and employ a robust
methodology to collect and annotate hateful users which does not depend
directly on lexicon and where the users are annotated given their entire
profile. This results in a sample of Twitter's retweet graph containing
$100,386$ users, out of which $4,972$ were annotated. We also collect the users
who were banned in the three months that followed the data collection. We show
that hateful users differ from normal ones in terms of their activity patterns,

comparing the neighbors of hateful vs. neighbors of normal users and also

observe that hateful users are densely connected, and thus formulate the hate

algorithm, which exploits the graph structure, outperforms content-based
approaches for the detection of both hateful ($95\%$ AUC vs $88\%$ AUC) and
suspended users ($93\%$ AUC vs $88\%$ AUC). Altogether, we present a

modeled as a stochastic counting process with independent,
exponentially-distributed interarrival times because of the analytic simplicity
such Poisson models afford. We analyze the distribution of several million unix
page commits to show that although this approach could be valid over relatively
long timespans, the behavior of the arrival process over shorter periods is
decidedly not Poisson. We find that this result holds regardless of the
originator of the request: unlike network packets, there is little difference
between system- and user-level page-request distributions. We believe this to
be due to the bursty nature of page allocations, which tend to occur in either
small or extremely large increments. Burstiness and persistent variance have
recently been found in self-similar processes in computer networks, but we show
that although page commits are both bursty and possess high variance over long
timescales, they are probably not self-similar. These results suggest that
altogether different models are needed for fine-grained analysis of memory
systems, an important consideration not only for understanding behavior but
also for the design of online control systems.

design for general linear multi-agent systems (MAS) based on an observer
viewpoint from undirected to directed topology, from stabilization to tracking
and from a leader without input to a one with bounded input. The followers can
form a TVF shape which is specified by piecewise continuously differential
vectors. The leader's trajectory, which is available to only a subset of
followers, is also time-varying. For the undirected formation tracking and
directed formation stabilization cases, only the relative output measurements
of neighbors are required to design control protocols; for the directed
formation tracking case, the agents need to be introspective (i.e. agents have
partial knowledge of their own states) and the output measurements are
required. Furthermore, considering the real applications, the leader with
bounded input case is studied. One main contribution of this paper is that
fully distributed adaptive output protocols, which require no global
information of communication topology and do not need the absolute or relative
state information, are proposed to solve the TVF control problem. Numerical
simulations including an application to nonholonomic mobile vehicles are

by employing black hole thermodynamics augmented by ideas from the information

choosing correct candidate black hole thermodynamic scaled equations of state,
parameterized by two exponents. These two adjustable exponents may be set to
accommodate additional black hole information, either from astrophysical
observations or from some microscopic theory, such as string theory. My
approach assumes implicitly that the as yet unknown microscopic black hole
constituents have strong effective interactions between them, of a type found
in critical phenomena. In this picture, the details of the microscopic
interaction forces are not important, and the essential macroscopic picture
emerges from general assumptions about the number of independent thermodynamic
variables, types of critical points, boundary conditions, and analyticity. I
use the simple Kerr and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes for guidance, and find
candidate equations of state that embody a number of the features of these
purely gravitational models. My approach may offer a productive new way to
select black hole thermodynamic equations of state representing both

active disk densities, a drifting uniform liquid forms in the absence of

organize into a pinned phase-separated cluster state in which clusters nucleate
around the obstacles, similar to a wetting phenomenon. We examine how the
depinning threshold changes as a function of disk or obstacle density, and find
a crossover from a collectively pinned cluster state to a disordered plastic
depinning transition as a function of increasing obstacle density. We compare
this to the behavior of nonballistic active particles and show that as we vary
the activity from completely passive to completely ballistic, a clogged
phase-separated state appears in both the active and passive limits, while for
intermediate activity, a readily flowing liquid state appears and there is an
optimal activity level that maximizes the flux through the sample.

learning in a constructive knowledge system based on general value functions
(GVFs). In real-world settings like robotics for unstructured and dynamic
environments, it is infeasible to model all meaningful aspects of a system and
its environment by hand due to both complexity and size. Instead, robots must
be capable of learning and adapting to changes in their environment and task,
incrementally constructing models from their own experience. GVFs, taken from
the field of reinforcement learning (RL), are a way of modeling the world as
predictive questions. One approach to such models proposes a massive network of
interconnected and interdependent GVFs, which are incrementally added over
time. It is reasonable to expect that new, incrementally added predictions can
be learned more swiftly if the learning process leverages knowledge gained from
past experience. The SR provides such a means of separating the dynamics of the
world from the prediction targets and thus capturing regularities that can be
reused across multiple GVFs. As a primary contribution of this work, we show
that using SR-based predictions can improve sample efficiency and learning
speed in a continual learning setting where new predictions are incrementally
added and learned over time. We analyze our approach in a grid-world and then
demonstrate its potential on data from a physical robot arm.

maximal visible MRI-defined abnormalities, and a gap exists between the imaging
signal changes and the actual tumor margins. Direct quantitative comparisons
between imaging and histological analyses are lacking to date. However, they
are of the utmost importance if one wishes to develop realistic models for

  Methods : In this study, we quantitatively compare the cell concentration and
the edema fraction from human histological biopsy samples (BSs) performed
inside and outside imaging abnormalities during serial imaging-based
stereotactic biopsy of diffuse low-grade gliomas.
  Results : The cell concentration was significantly higher in BSs located
inside (1189 $\pm$ 378 cell/mm$^2$) than outside (740 $\pm$ 124 cell/mm$^2$)
MRI-defined abnormalities (p=0.0003). The edema fraction was significantly
higher in BSs located inside (mean, 45 $\pm$ 23%) than outside (mean, 5 $\pm$

abnormalities, 20% of the tissue surface area was occupied by edema, and only
3% by tumor cells. The cycling cell concentration was significantly higher in

antenna arrays are used. Prior work has leveraged the sparse nature of mmWave
channels via compressed sensing based algorithms for channel estimation. Most
of these algorithms, though, assume perfect synchronization and are vulnerable
to phase errors that arise due to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase
noise. Recently sparsity-aware, non-coherent beamforming algorithms that are
robust to phase errors were proposed for narrowband phased array systems with
full resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Such energy based
algorithms, however, are not robust to heavy quantization at the receiver. In
this paper, we develop a joint CFO and wideband channel estimation algorithm
that is scalable across different mmWave architectures. Our method exploits the
sparsity of mmWave MIMO channel in the angle-delay domain, in addition to
compressibility of the phase error vector. We formulate the joint estimation as
a sparse bilinear optimization problem and then use message passing for
recovery. We also give an efficient implementation of a generalized bilinear
message passing algorithm for the joint estimation in mmWave systems with
one-bit ADCs. Simulation results show that our method is able to recover the

small data structures, making them easy to share in compressed form. Many
interesting graph calculations have worst-case complexity bounds ${\cal

witnessing and paradim shift in terms of operational safety of flying vehicles.
Safe and ubiquitous human-system interaction shall remain the core requirement
but those prescribed in general aviation are not adapted for UAVs. Yet we
believe it is possible to leverage the specific aspects of unmanned aviation to
meet acceptable safety requirements. We start this paper with by discussing the
new operational context of civilian UAVs and investigate the meaning of safety
in light of this new context. Next, we explore the different approaches to
ensuring system safety from an avionics point of view. Subsets of operational
requirements such as geofencing or mechanical systems for termination or impact
limitation can easily be implemented. These are presented with the goal of
limiting the collateral damages of a system failure. We then present some
experimental results regarding two of the major problems with UAVs. With actual
impacts, we demonstrate how dangerous uncontrolled crashes can be. Furthermore,
with the large number of runaway drone experiences during civilian operations,
the risk is even higher as they can travel a long way before crashing. We
provide data on such a case where the software controller is working, keeping
the UAV in the air, but the operator is unable to actually control the system.
It should be terminated! Finally, after having analyzed the context and some
actual solutions, based on a minimal set of requirement and our own experience,
we are proposing a simple mechanical based safety system. It unequivocally
terminates the flight in the most efficient way by instantly removing parts of
the propellers leaving a minimal lifting surface. It takes advantage of what
controllability may remain but with a deterministic ending: a definite landing.

testing process may compromise individuals' privacy. In this paper, we study
how to conduct hypothesis tests to compare population means while preserving
privacy. We use the notation of local differential privacy (LDP), which has
recently emerged as the main tool to ensure each individual's privacy without
the need of a trusted data collector. We propose LDP tests that inject noise
into every user's data in the samples before collecting them (so users do not
need to trust the data collector), and draw conclusions with bounded type-I
(significance level) and type-II errors (1 - power). Our approaches can be
extended to the scenario where some users require LDP while some are willing to
provide exact data. We report experimental results on real-world datasets to
verify the effectiveness of our approaches.

worse than the trivial ""no-measurement"" strategy. We present a sufficient

the dust evacuation time with the time of cloud destruction due to either
expansion of HII regions or supernovae. The cloud destruction time has weak
dependence on the cloud radius, while the dust evacuation time becomes shorter
for a cloud with the smaller radius. The dust evacuation thus occurs in compact
star-forming clouds whose column density is $N_{\rm H} \simeq 10^{24} - 10^{26}
~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. The critical halo mass above which the dust evacuation occurs
becomes lower for higher formation redshift, e.g., $\sim 10^{9}~M_{\odot}$ at
redshift $z \sim 3$ and $\sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ at $z \sim 9$. In addition,
metallicity of the gas should be less than $\sim 10^{-2} ~ Z_{\odot}$.
Otherwise the dust attenuation reduces the radiation force significantly. From
the dust-evacuated gas, massive stars are likely to form even with metallicity
above $\sim 10^{-5}~Z_{\odot}$, the critical value for low-mass star formation
due to the dust cooling. This can explain the dearth of ultra-metal poor stars

The TESLA cavities at XFEL accelerator are tuned using slow (step motors) and
fast (piezo) tuners driven by the control system. The goal of this control
system is to keep the detuning of the cavity as close to zero as possible even
in the presence of disturbing effects (LFD - Lorentz Force Detuning and
microphonics). The step motor tuners are used to coarse cavity tuning while
piezo actuators are used to fine-tuning and disturbance compensation. The
crucial part of the piezo control system is the piezo driver. To compensate LFD
the piezo driving with relatively high voltage (up to 100V) and high current
(up to 1A) is needed. Since the piezo components are susceptible to destruction
with overvoltage, overcurrent, and also overtemperature, one has to pay special
attention to keep the piezos healthy. What makes things worse and more
critical, is that the piezo exchange is not possible after the module is
assembled. Therefore the special hardware must be assisting the power
amplifier, detecting the dangerous conditions and disabling piezo operation
when needed. It must be fail-safe, so even in a case of failure the piezos
shall survive. It must be also robust and it must not disturb or disable normal
operation. Due to many channels (16 for master/slave RF), the hardware solution
must be well scalable. The paper discuss the design of XFEL's piezo driver
together with PEM (Power and Energy Monitor) supervising the driver operation
and preventing piezos from destruction. The achieved results and operation of

statistics or steganalytic features. Since most of the state-of-the-art
steganalytic methods employ a machine learning (ML) based classifier, it is
reasonable to consider countering steganalysis by trying to fool the ML
classifiers. However, simply applying perturbations on stego images as
adversarial examples may lead to the failure of data extraction and introduce
unexpected artefacts detectable by other classifiers. In this paper, we present
a steganographic scheme with a novel operation called adversarial embedding,
which achieves the goal of hiding a stego message while at the same time
fooling a convolutional neural network (CNN) based steganalyzer. The proposed
method works under the conventional framework of distortion minimization.
Adversarial embedding is achieved by adjusting the costs of image element
modifications according to the gradients backpropagated from the CNN classifier
targeted by the attack. Therefore, modification direction has a higher
probability to be the same as the sign of the gradient. In this way, the so
called adversarial stego images are generated. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed steganographic scheme is secure against the targeted adversary-unaware
steganalyzer. In addition, it deteriorates the performance of other
adversary-aware steganalyzers opening the way to a new class of modern
steganographic schemes capable to overcome powerful CNN-based steganalysis.

analysis method, namely the synchrosqueezing transform (SST), is employed to
represent their power spectra and to reconstruct the high-frequency signals at
different solar atmospheric layers. A validation study with synthetic signals
demonstrates that SST is capable to resolving weak signals even when their
strength is comparable with the high-frequency noise. The power spectra,
obtained from both SST and the Fourier transform, of the entire umbral region
indicate that there are significant enhancements between 10 and 14 mHz (labeled
as 12 mHz) at different atmospheric layers. Analyzing the spectrum of a
photospheric region far away from the umbra demonstrates that this 12~mHz
component exists only inside the umbra. The animation based on the
reconstructed 12 mHz component in AIA 171 \AA\ illustrates that an
intermittently propagating wave first emerges near the footpoints of coronal
fan structures, and then propagates outward along the structures. A
time--distance diagram, coupled with a subsonic wave speed ($\sim$ 49 km
s$^{-1}$), highlights the fact that these coronal perturbations are best
described as upwardly propagating magnetoacoustic slow waves. Thus, we first
reveal the high-frequency oscillations with a period around one minute in

typically employ coordinates which are aligned with the magnetic field lines.
Anisotropic turbulent fluctuations can be represented in such field-aligned
coordinates very efficiently, but the resulting non-trivial boundary conditions
involve all three spatial directions, and must be handled with care. The
standard ""twist-and-shift"" formulation of the boundary conditions [Beer,
Cowley, Hammett \textit{Phys. Plasmas} \textbf{2}, 2687 (1995)] was derived
assuming axisymmetry and is widely used because it is efficient, as long as the
global magnetic shear is not too small. A generalization of this formulation is
presented, appropriate for studies of non-axisymmetric, stellarator-symmetric
configurations, as well as for axisymmetric configurations with small global
shear. The key idea is to replace the ""twist"" of the standard approach (which
accounts only for global shear) with the integrated local shear. This
generalization allows one significantly more freedom when choosing the extent
of the simulation domain in each direction, without losing the natural
efficiency of field-line-following coordinates. It also corrects errors
associated with naive application of axisymmetric boundary conditions to
non-axisymmetric configurations. Simulations of stellarator turbulence that
employ the generalized boundary conditions require much less resolution than
simulations that use the (incorrect, axisymmetric) boundary conditions. We also
demonstrate the surprising result that (at least in some cases) an easily
implemented but manifestly incorrect formulation of the boundary conditions
does {\it not} change important predicted quantities, such as the turbulent
heat flux.

algorithm that learns to assign weights to training examples based on their

meta gradient descent step on the current mini-batch example weights (which are
initialized from zero) to minimize the loss on a clean unbiased validation set.
Our proposed method can be easily implemented on any type of deep network, does

be a kind of \textbf{spaceship} on which modules are hanged. The spaceship is a
functional Gaussian process and each module is the asymptotic representation of
one statistic in terms of that Gaussian process. In that way, it is possible to
navigate from one module to another, that is, to find the joint distribution of
any pair of statistics, to compare them with respect to the areas and the
times. In order to be able to do so, we should have a broad conception at the
beginning. Within the constructed frame, the asymptotic joint law of any finite
number of other statistics is automatically given as well as the joint
distribution of its spatial variation or temporal variation, in absolute or
relative values. We also deal with the general problem of decomposability of
statistics by comparing statistical decomposability, a new view we introduce,
versus functional decomposability. A general result only based on the GRI is
provided. \noindent This monograph is also the portal of a handbook of GRI that
will cover the largest number possible of statistics. In prevision of that, we

are used in a large number of chemical, physical and biological applications.
Although a considerable experimental and theoretical effort has been devoted in
the past few decades to investigate such monolayers, some of their fundamental
properties are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we model charged
colloidal monolayers as a continuum layer of finite thickness, with separate
charge distribution on the water and air sides. The electrostatic surface
free-energy and surface pressure are calculated via the charging method and
within the Debye-H{\""u}ckel approximation. We obtain the dependence of surface
pressure on several system parameters: the monolayer thickness, its distinct
dielectric permittivity, and the ionic strength of the aqueous subphase. The
surface pressure scaling with the area per particle, ${a}$, is found to be
between ${a}^{-2}$ in the close-packing limit, and ${a}^{-5/2}$ in the
loose-packing limit. In general, it is found that the surface-pressure is
strongly influenced by charges on the air-side of the colloids. However, when
the larger charge resides on the water-side, a more subtle dependence on salt
concentration emerges. This corrects a common assumption that the charges on
the water-side can \textit{always} be neglected due to screening. Finally,
using a single fit parameter, our theory is found to fit well the experimental
data for strong to intermediate strength electrolytes. We postulate that an
anomalous scaling of $a^{-3/2}$, recently observed in low ionic concentrations,
cannot be accounted for within a linear theory, and its explanation requires a
fully-nonlinear analysis.

Such correspondence is then used for initial camera-projector calibration.
Then, to gain more robustness against noises, especially those from an
imperfect planar calibration board, a bundle adjustment algorithm is developed
to jointly optimize the estimated camera and projector models. Aside from the
robustness, our solution requires only one shot of SL pattern for each
calibration board pose, which is much more convenient than multi-shot solutions
in practice. Data validations are conducted on both synthetic and real

modes of operation for inducing electromagnetic field, where the focal
adjustment of the E field can be optimized. Methods: The setup consists of two
identical figure-of-eight coils, namely coil 1 and coil 2, coupled to each
other by magnetic resonance coupling. Coil 1 is driven by active source, where
coil 2 is driven by the magnetic field coupled from coil 1. The frequency of
operation would affect the coupling between the coils and hence the current
ratios induced. Results: In the first and the second modes, the current
dominates at the first coil and the second coil, respectively. In the third
mode, both coils conduct similar amount of currents. Conclusion: The concept is
proven by measuring the current ratios of the coils and the voltage induced in
biological tissues. The current ratios in the first and the second modes are
measured as maximum 13.0 and minimal 0.258 at frequencies 487.7 kHz and 453.2
kHz, respectively, while the current ratio measured in the third mode is 1.03.
Significance: The tri-mode coil could potentially be applied for biological
applications such as pulsed electromagnetic energy treatment and thermoacoustic
imaging.

model) using the counter-rotating-hybridized rotating wave method (CHRW), which
is a simple method based on a unitary transformation with a parameter $\xi$.
This approach is beyond the traditional rotating-wave approximation (Rabi-RWA)
and more importantly, remains the RWA form with a renormalized tunneling
strength and a modified driving strength. The reformulated rotating wave method
not only possesses the same mathematical simplicity as the Rabi-RWA but also
allows us to explore the effects of counter-rotating (CR) components. We focus
on the properties of off-resonance cases for which the Rabi-RWA method breaks
down. After comparing the results of different RWA schemes and those of the
numerically exact method in a wide range of parameter regime, we show that the
CHRW method gives the accurate driven dynamics which is in good agreement with
the numerical method. Moreover, the other RWA methods appear as various
limiting cases of the CHRW method. The CHRW method reveals the effects of the
CR terms clearly by means of coherent destruction of tunneling and
Bloch-Siegert shift. Our main results are as follows: (i) the dynamics of the
coherent destruction of tunneling is explicitly given and its dependence on
$\Delta$ is clarified, which is quantitatively in good agreement with the exact
results; (ii) the CR modulated Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift are
analytically calculated, which is the same as the exact results up to fourth
order; (iii) the validity of parameter regions of different RWA methods are
given and the comparison of dynamics of these methods are shown. Since the CHRW
approach is mathematically simple as well as tractable and physically clear, it
may be extended to some complicated problems where it is difficult to do a

minimally shielded or unshielded environments make it especially attractive.
Although the technology has been widely demonstrated over several decades, it
is yet to be shown that it can be diagnostic and improve patient outcomes in
clinical applications. We here demonstrate the robustness of pre-polarizing MRI
(PMRI) technology for assembly and deployment in developing countries for the
specific application to infant hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus treatment planning
and management requires modest spatial resolution, and only that the brain can
be distinguished from fluid - tissue contrast detail within the brain
parenchyma is not essential. We constructed an internally shielded PMRI system
based on the Lee-Whiting coil system with a 22 cm diameter of spherical volume.
In an unshielded room, projection phantom images were acquired at 113 kHz with
in-plane resolution of 3 mm x 3 mm, by introducing gradient fields of
sufficient magnitude to dominate the 5000ppm inhomogeneity of the readout
field. The low cost, straightforward assembly, deployment potential, and
maintenance requirements demonstrate the suitability of our PMRI system for

and solved numerically. For various types of coupling distribution, we obtain
accurate results for magnetization, particularly in the presence of a weak
external magnetic field. We show that in the weak magnetic field limit, similar
to the 1D model, magnetization exhibits a singular power-law behavior with
divergent susceptibility. Remarkably, the spectrum of magnetic exponents is
markedly different from that of the 1D system even in the case of two coupled
chains. The magnetic exponent makes a crossover from being dependent on the
distribution function to a constant value independent of distribution. We
provide an analytic theory for these observations by extending the Chen-Ma
argument to the Q1D case. We derive an analytical formula for the exponent
which is in perfect agreement with the numerical results.

We present a non-calorimetric method which yields the heat absorbed during

a resonant radio frequency circuit which is employed for the irradiation. The
approach provides the absorbed power in real-time, without the need to monitor
the sample temperature as a function of time. As such, it is free from the
problems caused by the non-adiabatic heating conditions of the usual
calorimetry. We validate the method by comparing the dissipated power with a
conventional calorimetric measurement. We present the validation for two types
of resonators with very different filling factors: a solenoid and a so-called
birdcage coil. The latter is a volume coil, which is generally used in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) under in vivo condition. The presented method therefore
allows to effectively combine MRI and thermotherapy and is thus readily
adaptable to existing imaging hardware.

excellent accuracy. For near-extremal black string with event horizon very
close to the cosmological horizon, the P\""oschl-Teller technique gives accurate

decay faster. The QNMs of black string in spacetime with negative cosmological

hydrocarbon (HC) migration. In order to scrutinize this issue, it is expedient
to utilize already available numerical reservoir simulation tools. Such tools
are typically based on the Darcy flow model and are used to identify the
structural features of the formation and estimate the production profile.
Likewise, the migration of HCs can also be modelled allowing to clarify the
possible location of HC deposits with higher accuracy. Despite all the
advantages of this approach, there are some significant drawbacks, including
the long computational time required to simulate the hydrodynamic process of HC
migration. This issue cannot always be resolved by increasing computational
power due to its technological scarcity. Thus, the authors suggest using a
method of the numerical scheme splitting along the coordinates (further called
NSS-method), allowing to significantly reduce the computational time when
modelling HC migration. Explicit and implicit numerical models are created and
scrutinized for the purpose of this research. The validity of these models is
verified by their comparison with the available analytical solutions and by
analyzing the stability of numerical schemes. As a result, the influence of
NSS-method on the calculation accuracy was insignificant, allowing to decrease
the computational time and number of time steps approximately by three orders
of magnitude and 300 times, respectively.

different scales play different roles in the embedding learning. In this paper,
we propose an Attention-based Adversarial Autoencoder Network Embedding(AAANE)

vote for robust representations. The proposed AAANE consists of two components:
1) Attention-based autoencoder effectively capture the highly non-linear
network structure, which can de-emphasize irrelevant scales during training. 2)
An adversarial regularization guides the autoencoder learn robust
representations by matching the posterior distribution of the latent embeddings
to given prior distribution. This is the first attempt to introduce attention
mechanisms to multi-scale network embedding. Experimental results on real-world

current pulses can travel only across small distances in metals. The injection
of the ultrashort spin pulses from the metallic ferromagnet, where they have to
be generated, into a semiconductor is proposed as the first step to overcome
both issues by allowing the exited electrons to propagate in a medium with few

challenging due to practical constraints like chemical and structural
stability. This work therefore expands the study of injection to a broader
range of interfaces, and analyses how different metallic layers and
semiconductors influence the amplitude, the spin polarisation and duration of
the ultrashort pulses. This provides guidelines for the selection of efficient

where $T_{\underline{i}}$ is a $\Bbb Z^d$ action. In most cases the multiple
(random) fields of martingale differences is given by a completely commuting
filtration. A central limit theorem proving convergence to a normal law has
been known for Bernoulli random fields and in [V15] this result was extended to
random fields where one of generating transformations is ergodic. In the
present paper it is proved that a convergence takes place always and the limit
law is a mixture of normal laws. If the $\Bbb Z^d$ action is ergodic and $d\geq
2$, the limit law need not be normal. For proving the result mentioned above, a
generalisation of McLeish's CLT for arrays $(X_{n,i})$ of martingale
differences is used. More precisely, sufficient conditions for a CLT are found
in the case when the sums $\sum_i X_{n,i}^2$ converge only in distribution. The
CLT is followed by a weak invariance principle. It is shown that central limit
theorems and invariance principles using martingale approximation remain valid
in the non-ergodic case.

indeed, rankings are having a major impact on the design of research policies,

scientific citations are driven by the reputation of the reference so that the
PageRank algorithm is expected to yield a rank which reflects the reputation of
an academic institution in a specific field. Our results allow to quantifying

statistically robust and less prone to bias, at odds with ad--hoc surveys often

realistic conditions, KHI may produce nonlinear perturbations to the stream
during infall. Therefore, we proceed here to study the nonlinear stage of KHI,
still limited to a two-dimensional slab with no radiative cooling or gravity.
Using analytic models and numerical simulations, we examine stream breakup,
deceleration and heating via surface modes and body modes. The relevant
parameters are the density contrast between stream and CGM ($\delta$), the Mach
number of the stream velocity with respect to the CGM ($M_{\rm b}$) and the
stream radius relative to the halo virial radius ($R_{\rm s}/R_{\rm v}$). We
find that sufficiently thin streams disintegrate prior to reaching the central
galaxy. The condition for breakup ranges from $R_{\rm s} < 0.03 R_{\rm v}$ for
$(M_{\rm b} \sim 0.75, \delta \sim 10)$ to $R_{\rm s} < 0.003 R_{\rm v}$ for

nonlinear deformable simulation framework. Unlike other deep learning
applications such as image recognition, where different inputs have a uniform
and consistent format (e.g. an array of all the pixels in an image), the input
for deformable simulation is quite variable, high-dimensional, and
parametrization-unfriendly. Consequently, even though DNN is known for its rich
expressivity of nonlinear functions, directly using DNN to reconstruct the
force-displacement relation for general deformable simulation is nearly
impossible. DeepWarp obviates this difficulty by partially restoring the
force-displacement relation via warping the nodal displacement simulated using
a simplistic constitutive model -- the linear elasticity. In other words,
DeepWarp yields an incremental displacement fix based on a simplified
(therefore incorrect) simulation result other than returning the unknown
displacement directly. We contrive a compact yet effective feature vector
including geodesic, potential and digression to sort training pairs of per-node
linear and nonlinear displacement. DeepWarp is robust under different model
shapes and tessellations. With the assistance of deformation substructuring,
one DNN training is able to handle a wide range of 3D models of various
geometries including most examples shown in the paper. Thanks to the linear
elasticity and its constant system matrix, the underlying simulator only needs
to perform one pre-factorized matrix solve at each time step, and DeepWarp is
able to simulate large models in real time.

Internet connection because of their simplicity of deployment and operation. As
a result, the number of devices accessing the Internet through WLANs such as
laptops, smartphones, or wearables, is increasing drastically at the same time
that applications' throughput requirements do. To cope with these challenges,
channel bonding (CB) techniques are used for enabling higher data rates by
transmitting in wider channels, thus increasing spectrum efficiency. However,
important issues like higher potential co-channel and adjacent channel
interference arise when bonding channels. This may harm the performance of the
carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol because of recurrent backoff
freezing while making nodes more sensitive to hidden node effects. In this
paper, we address the following point at issue: is it convenient for
high-density (HD) WLANs to use wider channels and potentially overlap in the
spectrum? First, we highlight key aspects of DCB in toy scenarios through a
continuous time Markov network (CTMN) model. Then, by means of extensive
simulations covering a wide range of traffic loads and access point (AP)
densities, we show that dynamic channel bonding (DCB) - which adapts the
channel bandwidth on a per-packet transmission - significantly outperforms
traditional single-channel on average. Nevertheless, results also corroborate
that DCB is more prone to generate unfair situations where WLANs may starve.
Contrary to most of the current thoughts pushing towards non-overlapping
channels in HD deployments, we highlight the benefits of allocating channels as
wider as possible to WLANs altogether with implementing adaptive access
policies to cope with the unfairness situations that may appear.

decay exponentially at greater distances. We find that the average energy of
the correlated area is close to the ground-state energy of a skyrmion, while
the topological charge of the area is close to $\pm 1$. Correlation function of
the topological charge density exhibits oscillations with a period determined
by the ferromagnetic correlation length, while its Fourier transform exhibits a
maximum. These findings suggest that static randomness transforms a 2D
ferromagnetic state into a skyrmion-antiskyrmion glass.

probability measure for a random variable that can be used as input for Monte
Carlo simulation. When datasets for Bayesian inference are small, a principle
challenge is that, as additional data are collected, the probability measure
inferred from Bayesian inference may change significantly. That is, the
original probability density inferred from Bayesian inference may differ
considerably from the updated probability density both in its model form and
parameters. In such cases, expensive Monte Carlo simulations may have already
been performed using the original distribution and it is infeasible to start
again and perform a new Monte Carlo analysis using the updated density due to
the large added computational cost. In this work, we discuss four strategies
for updating Mote Carlo simulations for such a change in probability measure:
1. Importance sampling reweighting; 2. A sample augmenting strategy; 3. A
sample filtering strategy; and 4. A mixed augmenting-filtering strategy. The
efficiency of each strategy is compared and the ultimate aim is to achieve the
change in distribution with a minimal number of added computational
simulations. The comparison results show that when the change in measure is
small importance sampling reweighting can be very effective. Otherwise, a
proposed novel mixed augmenting-filtering algorithm can robustly and
efficiently accommodate a measure change in Monte Carlo simulation that
minimizes the impact on the sample set and saves a large amount of additional
computational cost. The strategy is then applied for uncertainty quantification
in the buckling strength of a simple plate given ongoing data collection to
estimate uncertainty in the yield stress.

gated graphene has non-trivial effects on electron-hole puddles, since it
generates mass in the Dirac action and destroys the scaling behaviors of the
effective Thomas-Fermi-Dirac theory. We provide detailed analysis on the
resulting spatially inhomogeneous system in the framework of the
Thomas-Fermi-Dirac theory for the Gaussian (white noise) disorder potential. We
show that, the chemical potential in this system as a random surface, destroys
the self-similarity, and the charge field is non-Gaussian. We find that the
two-body correlation functions are factorized to two terms: a pure function of
the chemical potential and a pure function of the distance. The spatial
dependence of these correlation functions is double-logarithmic, e.g. the
two-point density correlation $D_2(r,\mu)\propto
\mu^2\exp\left[-\left(-a_D\ln\ln r^{\beta_D}\right)^{\alpha_D} \right]$
($\alpha_D=1.82$, $\beta_D=0.263$ and $a_D=0.955$). The Fourier power spectrum
function behaves like $\ln(S(q))=-\beta_S^{-a_S}\left(\ln q \right)^{a_S}+2\ln

Gaussian rough surfaces for which $a_S=1$ and

  using projections of taxi GPS-based vector fields",,"Journal of Geographical Systems 20 (2018) 253-274","10.1007/s10109-018-0273-6",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ubiquitous taxi trajectory data has made it possible to apply it to different
types of travel analysis. Of interest is the need to allow someone to monitor
travel momentum and associated congestion in any location in space in real
time. However, despite an abundant literature in taxi data visualization and
its applicability to travel analysis, no easy method exists. To measure taxi
travel momentum at a location, current methods require filtering taxi
trajectories that stop at a location at a particular time range, which is
computationally expensive. We propose an alternative, computationally cheaper
way based on pre-processing vector fields from the trajectories. Algorithms are
formalized for generating vector kernel density to estimate a travel-model-free
vector field-based representation of travel momentum in an urban space. The
algorithms are shared online as an open source GIS 3D extension called
VectorKD. Using 17 million daily taxi GPS points within Beijing over a four-day
period, we demonstrate how to generate in real time a series of projections
from a continuously updated vector field of taxi travel momentum to query a
point of interest anywhere in a city, such as the CBD or the airport. This
method allows a policy-maker to automatically identify temporal net influxes of
travel demand to a location. The proposed methodology is shown to be over
twenty times faster than a conventional selection query of trajectories. We
also demonstrate, using taxi data entering the Beijing Capital International
Airport and the CBD, how we can quantify in nearly real time the occurrence and
magnitude of inbound or outbound queueing and congestion periods due to taxis
cruising or waiting for passengers, all without having to fit any mathematical
queueing model to the data.

  Data Analysis",,,"10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.07.222",,"stat.ML cs.CG cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chatter identification and detection in machining processes has been an
active area of research in the past two decades. Part of the challenge in
studying chatter is that machining equations that describe its occurrence are
often nonlinear delay differential equations. The majority of the available
tools for chatter identification rely on defining a metric that captures the
characteristics of chatter, and a threshold that signals its occurrence. The
difficulty in choosing these parameters can be somewhat alleviated by utilizing
machine learning techniques. However, even with a successful classification
algorithm, the transferability of typical machine learning methods from one
data set to another remains very limited. In this paper we combine supervised
machine learning with Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to obtain a descriptor of
the process which can detect chatter. The features we use are derived from the
persistence diagram of an attractor reconstructed from the time series via
Takens embedding. We test the approach using deterministic and stochastic
turning models, where the stochasticity is introduced via the cutting
coefficient term. Our results show a 97% successful classification rate on the
deterministic model labeled by the stability diagram obtained using the
spectral element method. The features gleaned from the deterministic model are
then utilized for characterization of chatter in a stochastic turning model
where there are very limited analysis methods.

of a location from social metadata of Flickr photos. In particular, we built
machine learning classifiers to predict the class of a location where each
class corresponds to a set of locations having equal aesthetic rating. These
models are trained on two empirically build datasets containing locations in
two different cities (Rome and Paris) where aesthetic ratings of locations were
gathered from TripAdvisor.com. In this work we exploit the idea that in a
location with higher aesthetic rating, it is more likely for an user to capture
a photo and other users are more likely to interact with that photo. Our models
achieved as high as 79.48% accuracy (78.60% precision and 79.27% recall) on
Rome dataset and 73.78% accuracy(75.62% precision and 78.07% recall) on Paris
dataset. The proposed technique can facilitate urban planning, tour planning
and recommending aesthetically pleasing paths.

well-being, pets are believed to play a significant role in people's daily
lives. Many traditional studies have identified that frequent interactions with
pets could make individuals become healthier and more optimistic, and
ultimately enjoy a happier life. However, most of those studies are not only
restricted in scale, but also may carry biases by using subjective
self-reports, interviews, and questionnaires as the major approaches. In this
paper, we leverage large-scale data collected from social media and the
state-of-the-art deep learning technologies to study this phenomenon in depth
and breadth. Our study includes four major steps: 1) collecting timeline posts
from around 20,000 Instagram users, 2) using face detection and recognition on
2-million photos to infer users' demographics, relationship status, and whether
having children, 3) analyzing a user's degree of happiness based on images and
captions via smiling classification and textual sentiment analysis, 3) applying
transfer learning techniques to retrain the final layer of the Inception v3
model for pet classification, and 4) analyzing the effects of pets on happiness
in terms of multiple factors of user demographics. Our main results have
demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed method with many new insights. We
believe this method is also applicable to other domains as a scalable,
efficient, and effective methodology for modeling and analyzing social
behaviors and psychological well-being. In addition, to facilitate the research
involving human faces, we also release our dataset of 700K analyzed faces.

manufacturing, however, they are usually contradictory with each other. Here, a
high-throughput high-resolution three dimensional (3D) printing is demonstrated
by incorporating a simultaneous spatiotemporal focusing (SSTF) scheme in
two-photon polymerization (TPP). Remarkably, the SSTF can ensure generation of
a spherical focal spot of which the size depends linearly on the laser power.
Thus, the resolution can be continuously adjusted from sub-10 {\mu}m to ~40
{\mu}m by only increasing the laser power. A multi-scale 3D structure is
fabricated using this technique, for which the regions of coarse and fine
feature sizes are produced at high and low resolutions, respectively.

acceptance in the community. Hence, i call them conjectures. The first three of
these are in my area of expertise, and I personally consider them to be
verified, if by evidence some others might find less than convincing. On the
the fourth I do not claim expert knowledge but it has not been refuted in any
way that I understand. The first is the proposition that the ground state of a
solid made up of simple bosons is phase coherent and sustains overlap currents.
The second proposes that the cuprate superconductors upper phase transition is
into an Ong vortex liquid phase which quantizes flux and consequently exhibits
a characteristic singular, nonlinear diamagnetic behavior. The third proposes
that the metallic phase of the doped Mott insulator, if it has a Fermi surface,
has deep entanglement and an orthogonality catastrophe causing a Fermi surface
singularity. This manifests itself as the strange metal of the cuprate phase
diagram. The fourth conjecture is that the dark energy in cosmology models is
the consequence at least in part of gravitational radiation carrying energy
past us.
