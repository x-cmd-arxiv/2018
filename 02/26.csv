has been extensively studied over the past decades. Such classification is
usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. But for many
applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility
planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more
informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental
challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual
buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the
functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify facade structures from
street view images, such as Google StreetView, in addition to remote sensing
images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was
utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding
street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training
and evaluating CNNs. In addition, the method was applied to generate building
classification maps on both region and city scales of several cities in Canada
and the US. Keywords: CNN, Building instance classification, Street view

limit, and may successfully account for a hidden-charm pentaquark state
recently observed by LHCb. In this work we extend the formalism to the

the resonant states observed by LHCb in the $J/\psi$-$\phi$ spectrum can be

known about the $\phi$ meson energy-momentum-tensor densities. With rather

we show that a $\psi(2S)$-$\phi$ bound state can exist, and obtain a

emerging naturally from the mean field theory of Bose gases. Their solutions
are known to be related to an initial value problem, respectively the
Gross-Pitaevskii and Hartree equations. Due to their physical and mathematical
relevance, the issues of well-posedness and uniqueness for these hierarchies
have recently been studied thoroughly using specific nonlinear and
combinatorial techniques. In this article, we introduce a new approach for the
study of such hierarchy equations by firstly establishing a duality between
them and certain Liouville equations and secondly solving the uniqueness and
existence questions for the latter. As an outcome, we formulate a hierarchy
equation starting from any initial value problem which is $U(1)$-invariant and
prove a general principle which can be stated formally as follows:
  (i) Uniqueness for weak solutions of an initial value problem implies the
uniqueness of solutions for the related hierarchy equation.
  (ii) Existence of solutions for the initial value problem implies existence
of solutions for the related hierarchy equation.
  In particular, several new well-posedness results as well as a counterexample
to uniqueness for the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy equation are proved. The
novelty in our work lies in the aforementioned duality and the use of Liouville
equations with powerful transport techniques extended to infinite dimensional

implementing a spike sorting module. Spike sorting is an important application
in the field of neural signal acquisition for implantable biomedical systems
whose function is to map the Neural-spikes (N-spikes) correctly to the neurons
from which it originates. The accurate classification is a pre-requisite for
the succeeding systems needed in Brain-Machine-Interfaces (BMIs) to give better
performance. The primary design constraint to be satisfied for the spike sorter
module is low power with good accuracy. There lies a trade-off in terms of
power consumption between the on-chip and off-chip training of the N-spike
features. In the former case care has to be taken to make the computational
units power efficient whereas in the later the data rate of wireless
transmission should be minimized to reduce the power consumption due to the
transceivers. In this work a 2-step shared training scheme involving a K-means
sorter and a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is elaborated for on-chip training
and classification. Also, a low power SNN classifier scheme using memristive
crossbar type architecture is compared with a fully digital implementation. The
advantage of the former classifier is that it is power efficient while
providing comparable accuracy as that of the digital implementation due to the
robustness of the SNN training algorithm which has a good tolerance for
variation in memristance.

approach for calculating the ground-state properties of strongly-correlated

requisite Hubbard parameters from first principles. We provide a detailed
treatment of spin within this linear response approach, demonstrating that the
conventional Hubbard $U$ formula, unlike the conventional DFT+$U$ corrective
functional, incorporates interactions that are off-diagonal in the spin indices
and places greater weight on one spin channel over the other. We construct
alternative definitions for Hubbard and Hund's parameters that are consistent
with the contemporary DFT+$U$ functional, expanding upon the minimum-tracking
linear response method. This approach allows Hund's $J$ and spin-dependent $U$
parameters to be calculated with the same ease as for the standard Hubbard $U$.
Our methods accurately reproduce the experimental band gap, local magnetic
moments, and the valence band edge character of manganese oxide, a canonical
strongly-correlated system. We also apply our approach to a complete series of
transition-metal complexes [M(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{n+}$ (for M = Ti to Zn), showing
that Hubbard corrections on oxygen atoms are necessary for preserving bond
lengths, and demonstrating that our methods are numerically well-behaved even
for near-filled subspaces such as in zinc. However, spectroscopic properties
appear beyond the reach of the standard DFT+$U$ approach. Collectively, these
results shed new light on the role of spin in the calculation of the corrective

interaction, the phase diagram of three-dimensional anisotropic Weyl semimetal
is studied by renormalization group theory. Weak disorder is irrelevant in
anisotropic Weyl semimetal, while the disorder becomes relevant and drives a
quantum phase transition from semimetal to compressible diffusive metal phases
if the disorder strength is larger than a critical value. The long-range
Coulomb interaction is irrelevant in clean anisotropic Weyl semimetal. However,
interestingly, we find that the long-range Coulomb interaction exerts a
dramatic influence on the critical disorder strength for phase transition to
compressible diffusive metal. Specifically, the critical disorder strength can
receive a prominent change even though an arbitrarily weak Coulomb interaction
is included. This novel behavior is closely related to the anisotropic
screening effect of Coulomb interaction,and essentially results from the
specifical energy dispersion of the fermion excitations in anisotropic Weyl
semimetal. The theoretical results are helpful for understanding the physical
properties of the candidates of anisotropic Weyl semimetal, such as pressured

for various classes of functions. These include solutions of elliptic PDEs on

attractive because it leads to highly compressed, adaptive approximations based
on simple discretizations. Standard choices of the underlying basis, such as
piecewise multilinear finite elements on uniform tensor product grids, entail
the well-known matrix ill-conditioning of discrete operators. We demonstrate
that for low-rank representations, the use of tensor structure itself
additionally introduces representation ill-conditioning, a new effect specific
to computations in tensor networks. We analyze the tensor structure of a BPX
preconditioner for second-order linear elliptic operators and construct an
explicit tensor-structured representation of the preconditioner, with ranks
independent of the number $L$ of discretization levels. The straightforward
application of the preconditioner yields discrete operators whose matrix
conditioning is uniform with respect to the discretization parameter, but in
decompositions that suffer from representation ill-conditioning. By
additionally eliminating certain redundancies in the representations of the
preconditioned discrete operators, we obtain reduced-rank decompositions that
are free of both matrix and representation ill-conditioning. For an iterative

the observed time series into a matrix, utilizing matrix estimation to recover
missing values and de-noise observed entries, and performing linear regression
to make predictions. At the core of our analysis is a representation result,
which states that for a large model class, the transformed time series matrix
is (approximately) low-rank. In effect, this generalizes the widely used
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) in time series literature, and allows us to
establish a rigorous link between time series analysis and matrix estimation.
The key to establishing this link is constructing a Page matrix with
non-overlapping entries rather than a Hankel matrix as is commonly done in the
literature (e.g., SSA). This particular matrix structure allows us to provide
finite sample analysis for imputation and prediction, and prove the asymptotic
consistency of our method. Another salient feature of our algorithm is that it
is model agnostic with respect to both the underlying time dynamics and the
noise distribution in the observations. The noise agnostic property of our
approach allows us to recover the latent states when only given access to noisy
and partial observations a la a Hidden Markov Model; e.g., recovering the
time-varying parameter of a Poisson process without knowing that the underlying
process is Poisson. Furthermore, since our forecasting algorithm requires
regression with noisy features, our approach suggests a matrix estimation based
method - coupled with a novel, non-standard matrix estimation error metric - to
solve the error-in-variable regression problem, which could be of interest in
its own right. Through synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that

of the human visual system (HVS) with uniform quality. Recent virtual reality
(VR) device with head mounted display (HMD) extends the field of view (FoV)
significantly to include both central and peripheral vision areas. It exhibits
the unequal image quality sensation among these areas because of the
non-uniform distribution of photoreceptors on our retina. We propose to study
the sensation impact on the image subjective quality with respect to the
eccentric angle $\theta$ across different vision areas. Often times, image
quality is controlled by the quantization stepsize $q$ and spatial resolution
$s$, separately and jointly. Therefore, the sensation impact can be understood
by exploring the $q$ and/or $s$ in terms of the $\theta$, resulting in
self-adaptive analytical models that have shown quite impressive accuracy
through independent cross validations. These models can further be applied to
give different quality weights at different regions, so as to significantly
reduce the transmission data size but without subjective quality loss. As
demonstrated in a gigapixel imaging system, we have shown that the image
rendering can be speed up about 10$\times$ with the model guided unequal
quality scales, in comparison to the the legacy scheme with uniform quality

on incrementally fusing 3D data into a common world frame. In particular, both
their fragile sensitivity to state estimation errors and computational cost can
be limiting. We develop an alternative framework, NanoMap, which alleviates the
need for global map fusion and enables a motion planner to efficiently query
pose-uncertainty-aware local 3D geometric information. The key idea of NanoMap
is to store a history of noisy relative pose transforms and search over a
corresponding set of depth sensor measurements for the minimum-uncertainty view
of a queried point in space. This approach affords a variety of capabilities
not offered by traditional mapping techniques: (a) the pose uncertainty
associated with 3D data can be incorporated in motion planning, (b) poses can
be updated (i.e., from loop closures) with minimal computational effort, and
(c) 3D data can be fused lazily for the purpose of planning. We provide an
open-source implementation of NanoMap, and analyze its capabilities and
computational efficiency in simulation experiments. Finally, we demonstrate in

role in conveying the energy from a supermassive black hole to the intracluster
medium (ICM) - the process known as radio-mode AGN feedback. Energy
conservation guarantees that a bubble loses most of its energy to the ICM after
crossing several pressure scale heights. However, actual processes responsible
for transferring the energy to the ICM are still being debated. One attractive
possibility is the excitation of internal waves, which are trapped in the
cluster's core and eventually dissipate. Here we show that a sufficient
condition for efficient excitation of these waves in stratified cluster
atmospheres is flattening of the bubbles in the radial direction. In our
numerical simulations, we model the bubbles phenomenologically as rigid bodies
buoyantly rising in the stratified cluster atmosphere. We find that the
terminal velocities of the flattened bubbles are small enough so that the
Froude number ${\rm Fr}\lesssim 1$. The effects of stratification make the
dominant contribution to the total drag force balancing the buoyancy force. In
particular, clear signs of internal waves are seen in the simulations. These
waves propagate horizontally and downwards from the rising bubble, spreading
their energy over large volumes of the ICM. If our findings are scaled to the
conditions of the Perseus cluster, the expected terminal velocity is
$\sim100-200{\,\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ near the cluster cores, which is in broad
agreement with direct measurements by the Hitomi satellite.

that stand out more than others. The reason behind some set of objects being
more important in a scene is based on a number of visual, as well as, cognitive
factors. Being motivated by the fact that user satisfaction is more dependent
on the quality of these salient objects in an image than non-salient ones, we
propose a quantifiable metric for measuring user-satisfiability (based on image
quality and delay of transmission). The bandwidth allocation technique proposed
thereafter, ensures that this user-satisfiability is maximized. Unlike the
existing approaches that utilize some fixed set of non-linear functions for
framing the user-satisfiability index, our metric is modelled over customer

learning complex behaviors. However, its sample efficiency is often
impractically large for solving challenging real-world problems, even with
off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic
model-free RL is that the learning signal consists only of scalar rewards,
ignoring much of the rich information contained in state transition tuples.
Model-based RL uses this information, by training a predictive model, but often
does not achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL due to model
bias. We introduce temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of
goal-conditioned value functions that can be trained with model-free learning
and used for model-based control. TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and
model-based RL: they leverage the rich information in state transitions to
learn very efficiently, while still attaining asymptotic performance that
exceeds that of direct model-based RL methods. Our experimental results show
that, on a range of continuous control tasks, TDMs provide a substantial
improvement in efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-based and

bugs to subvert the confidentiality and integrity of SGX enclaves.
Particularly, we show that when branch prediction of the enclave code can be
influenced by programs outside the enclave, the control flow of the enclave
program can be temporarily altered to execute instructions that lead to
observable cache-state changes. An adversary observing such changes can learn
secrets inside the enclave memory or its internal registers, thus completely
defeating the confidentiality guarantee offered by SGX. To demonstrate the
practicality of our SgxPectre Attacks, we have systematically explored the
possible attack vectors of branch target injection, approaches to win the race
condition during enclave's speculative execution, and techniques to
automatically search for code patterns required for launching the attacks. Our
study suggests that any enclave program could be vulnerable to SgxPectre
Attacks since the desired code patterns are available in most SGX runtimes
(e.g., Intel SGX SDK, Rust-SGX, and Graphene-SGX). Most importantly, we have
applied SgxPectre Attacks to steal seal keys and attestation keys from Intel
signed quoting enclaves. The seal key can be used to decrypt sealed storage
outside the enclaves and forge valid sealed data; the attestation key can be
used to forge attestation signatures. For these reasons, SgxPectre Attacks
practically defeat SGX's security protection. This paper also systematically
evaluates Intel's existing countermeasures against SgxPectre Attacks and
discusses the security implications.

a viable approach towards improving the quality of approximations in GPs that
scale well to large-scale data. Most of the current constructions assume full
independence across resolutions. This assumption simplifies the inference, but
it underestimates the uncertainties in transitioning from one resolution to
another. This in turn results in models which are prone to overfitting in the
sense of excessive sensitivity to the chosen resolution, and predictions which
are non-smooth at the boundaries. Our contribution is a new construction which
instead assumes conditional independence among GPs across resolutions. We show
that relaxing the full independence assumption enables robustness against
overfitting, and that it delivers predictions that are smooth at the
boundaries. Our new model is compared against current state of the art on 2
synthetic and 9 real-world datasets. In most cases, our new conditionally
independent construction performed favorably when compared against models based
on the full independence assumption. In particular, it exhibits little to no

differ in some respect from the training observations (the target class). In
reality, the novelty class is often absent during training, poorly sampled or
not well defined. Therefore, one-class classifiers can efficiently model such
problems. However, due to the unavailability of data from the novelty class,
training an end-to-end deep network is a cumbersome task. In this paper,
inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks for training deep
models in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, we propose an end-to-end
architecture for one-class classification. Our architecture is composed of two
deep networks, each of which trained by competing with each other while
collaborating to understand the underlying concept in the target class, and
then classify the testing samples. One network works as the novelty detector,
while the other supports it by enhancing the inlier samples and distorting the
outliers. The intuition is that the separability of the enhanced inliers and
distorted outliers is much better than deciding on the original samples. The
proposed framework applies to different related applications of anomaly and
outlier detection in images and videos. The results on MNIST and Caltech-256
image datasets, along with the challenging UCSD Ped2 dataset for video anomaly
detection illustrate that our proposed method learns the target class
effectively and is superior to the baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

the memory or processing power to train and sometimes even execute such models.
More importantly, the existing neural network solutions are trained in a
supervised manner. Meaning that an expert must label the network traffic and
update the model manually from time to time.
  In this paper, we present Kitsune: a plug and play NIDS which can learn to
detect attacks on the local network, without supervision, and in an efficient
online manner. Kitsune's core algorithm (KitNET) uses an ensemble of neural
networks called autoencoders to collectively differentiate between normal and
abnormal traffic patterns. KitNET is supported by a feature extraction

comparable to offline anomaly detectors, even on a Raspberry PI. This

cues within the language, combined with the implicit architectural biases
inherent in certain RNNs, may be sufficient to induce hierarchical
generalizations. The likelihood of acquiring the hierarchical generalization
increased when the language included an additional cue to hierarchy in the form
of subject-verb agreement, underscoring the role of cues to hierarchy in the

are increasingly using hardware accelerated encryption engines to secure
computation, memory access, and communication operations. The electromagnetic
(EM) emission from a chip leaks information of the underlying logical
operations and can be collected using low-cost non-invasive measurements. EM
based side-channel attacks (EMSCA) have emerged as a major threat to security
of encryption engines in a SoC. This paper presents the concept of Blindsight
where a high-frequency inductive voltage regulator (IVR) integrated on the same
chip with an encryption engine is used to increase resistance against EMSCA.
High-frequency (~100MHz) IVRs are present in modern microprocessors to improve
energy-efficiency. We show that an IVR with a randomized control loop (R-IVR)
can reduce EMSCA as the integrated inductance acts as a strong EM emitter and
blinds an adversary from EM emission of the encryption engine. The EM
measurements are performed on a test-chip containing two architectures of a
128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) engine powered by a high-frequency
R-IVR and under two attack scenarios, one, where an adversary gains complete
physical access of the target device and the other, where the adversary is only
in proximity of the device. In both attack modes, an adversary can observe
information leakage in Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) test in a baseline
IVR (B-IVR, without control loop randomization). However, we show that EM
emission from the R-IVR blinds the attacker and significantly reduces SCA
vulnerability of the AES engine. A range of practical side-channel analysis
including TVLA, Correlation Electromagnetic Analysis (CEMA), and a template
based CEMA shows that R-IVR can reduce information leakage and prevent key
extraction even against a skilled adversary.

$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots$ in an online fashion, effectively rejecting the
$k$-th null hypothesis whenever $P_k \leq \alpha_k$. Importantly, $\alpha_k$
must be a function of the past, and cannot depend on $P_k$ or any of the later
unseen $p$-values, and must be chosen to guarantee that for any time $t$, the
FDR up to time $t$ is less than some pre-determined quantity $\alpha \in
(0,1)$. In this work, we present a powerful new framework for online FDR
control that we refer to as SAFFRON. Like older alpha-investing (AI)
algorithms, SAFFRON starts off with an error budget, called alpha-wealth, that
it intelligently allocates to different tests over time, earning back some
wealth on making a new discovery. However, unlike older methods, SAFFRON's
threshold sequence is based on a novel estimate of the alpha fraction that it
allocates to true null hypotheses. In the offline setting, algorithms that
employ an estimate of the proportion of true nulls are called adaptive methods,
and SAFFRON can be seen as an online analogue of the famous offline Storey-BH
adaptive procedure. Just as Storey-BH is typically more powerful than the
Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure under independence, we demonstrate that
SAFFRON is also more powerful than its non-adaptive counterparts, such as LORD
and other generalized alpha-investing algorithms. Further, a monotone version
of the original AI algorithm is recovered as a special case of SAFFRON, that is
often more stable and powerful than the original. Lastly, the derivation of
SAFFRON provides a novel template for deriving new online FDR rules.

entangled two-qubit states (Bell states) and maximally three-tangled states
(three-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-class states). A striking feature
of the scheme is that the entangled states can be manipulated without
interacting with the entangled particles; for example, it is possible to switch
between two distinct Bell states. Furthermore, each entangled state corresponds
to a set of many-particle interference patterns. The visibility of these
patterns and the amount of entanglement in a quantum state are connected to

two vectors whose pairwise Hamming distance is minimum? This problem is known
as the \emph{Closest Pair Problem}. If these vectors are generated uniformly at
random except two of them are correlated with Pearson-correlation coefficient
$\rho$, then the problem is called the \emph{Light Bulb Problem}. In this work,
we propose a novel coding-based scheme for the Closest Pair Problem. We design
both randomized and deterministic algorithms, which achieve the best-known
running time when the length of input vectors $m$ is small and the minimum
distance is very small compared to $m$. Specifically, the running time of our
randomized algorithm is $O(n\log^{2}n\cdot 2^{c m} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(m))$ and
the running time of our deterministic algorithm is $O(n\log{n}\cdot 2^{c' m}
\cdot \mathrm{poly}(m))$, where $c$ and $c'$ are constants depending only on
the (relative) distance of the closest pair. When applied to the Light Bulb
Problem, our result yields state-of-the-art deterministic running time when the
Pearson-correlation coefficient $\rho$ is very large. Specifically, when $\rho
\geq 0.9933$, our deterministic algorithm runs faster than the previously best
deterministic algorithm (Alman, SOSA 2019).

replacing the part of $f$ on $[0,\delta]$ with the unique homogeneous cubic,

used in diverse machine learning (ML) and data analysis (DA) applications. This
is attributed to the simplicity of their implementations, as well as low
per-iteration computational/storage costs. However, they suffer from
significant disadvantages; most notably, their performance degrades with
increasing problem ill-conditioning. Furthermore, they often involve a large
number of hyper-parameters, and are notoriously sensitive to parameters such as
the step-size. By incorporating additional information from the Hessian,
second-order methods, have been shown to be resilient to many such adversarial
effects. However, these advantages of using curvature information come at the
cost of higher per-iteration costs, which in \enquote{big data} regimes, can be
computationally prohibitive.
  In this paper, we show that, contrary to conventional belief, second-order
methods, when implemented appropriately, can be more efficient than first-order
alternatives in many large-scale ML/ DA applications. In particular, in convex
settings, we consider variants of classical Newton\textsf{'}s method in which
the Hessian and/or the gradient are randomly sub-sampled. We show that by
effectively leveraging the power of GPUs, such randomized Newton-type
algorithms can be significantly accelerated, and can easily outperform state of

packages such as TensorFlow. Additionally these randomized methods incur a
small memory overhead compared to first-order methods. In particular, we show
that for million-dimensional problems, our GPU accelerated sub-sampled
Newton\textsf{'}s method achieves a higher test accuracy in milliseconds as

paper introduces several model free screening methods based on the partial
distance correlation and developed specifically to deal with time dependent

autoregressive models with exogenous predictors (NARX), and multivariate models

for our methods, which depend on the moment conditions, and the strength of
dependence in the response and covariate processes, amongst other factors.
Dependence is quantified by functional dependence measures (Wu [Proc. Natl.

couplings to third generation fermions is an important test of the mechanism of

properties of the Higgs boson, the values of these couplings are still
uncertain and, in models of new physics, they can differ in magnitude as well
as in sign with respect to the Standard Model case. In this article, we study
the possibility of a wrong sign bottom-quark Yukawa coupling within the
framework of the Minimal and Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
Possible experimental tests are also discussed, including novel decays of the

non--spherical configurations constructed from Szekeres dust models with
positive spatial curvature that smoothly match to a Schwarzschild exterior.
These configurations are made of an almost spherical central core region
surrounded by a network of ""pancake-like"" overdensities and voids with spatial
positions prescribed through standard initial conditions. We show that a full
collapse into a focusing singularity, without shell crossings appearing before
the formation of an apparent horizon, is not possible unless the full
configuration becomes exactly or almost spherical. Seeking for black hole
formation, we demand that shell crossings are covered by the apparent horizon.
This requires very special fine-tuned initial conditions that impose very
strong and unrealistic constraints on the total black hole mass and full
collapse time. As a consequence, non-spherical non-rotating dust sources cannot
furnish even minimally realistic toy models of black hole formation at
astrophysical scales: demanding realistic collapse time scales yields huge
unrealistic black hole masses, while simulations of typical astrophysical black
hole masses collapse in unrealistically small times. We note, however, that the
resulting time--mass constraint is compatible with early Universe models of
primordial black hole formation, suitable in early dust-like environments.
Finally, we argue that the shell crossings appearing when non-spherical dust
structures collapse are an indicator that such structures do not form galactic
mass black holes but virialise into stable stationary objects.

giant exoplanets, hot Jupiters. For lack of enough materials in current
locations of hot Jupiters, they are perceived to form outside snowline. Then,
migrate to the locations observed through interactions with gas disks or
high-eccentricity mechanisms. We examined the efficiencies of different
high-eccentricity mechanisms to form hot Jupiters in near coplaner multi-planet
systems. These mechanisms include planet-planet scattering, Kozai-Lidov
mechanism, coplanar high-eccentricity migration, secular chaos, as well as
other two new mechanisms we find in this work, which can produce hot Jupiters
with high inclinations even retrograde. We find Kozai-Lidov mechanism plays the
most important role in producing hot Jupiters among these mechanisms. Secular
chaos is not the usual channel for the formation of hot Jupiters due to the
lack of angular momentum deficit within 10^7 Tin (periods of the inner orbit).
According to comparisons between the observations and simulations, we speculate
that there are at least two populations of hot Jupiters. One population
migrates into the boundary of tidal effects due to interactions with gas disk,
such as ups And b, WASP-47 b and HIP 14810 b. These systems usually have at
least two planets with lower eccentricities, and keep dynamical stable in
compact orbital configurations. Another population forms through
high-eccentricity mechanisms after the excitation of eccentricity due to
dynamical instability. This kind of hot Jupiters usually has Jupiterlike
companions in distant orbits with moderate or high eccentricities.

well-established and recently developed methods for approximate posterior

first obtain intermediate object localization and pixel labeling results for

fusing object instances, pixel labeling for the training images, and
task-specific network training. To obtain clean object instances in the

classifying object instances collected from multiple solution mechanisms. In
this algorithm, we incorporate both metric learning and density-based
clustering to filter detected object instances. Experiments show that our
weakly supervised pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-label

Twitter, which in turn generate valuable data for public health monitoring,
digital epidemiology, and other analyses of population health at global scale.
The first, critical, task for these applications is classifying whether a
personal health event was mentioned, which we call the (PHM) problem. This task
is challenging for many reasons, including typically short length of social
media posts, inventive spelling and lexicons, and figurative language,
including hyperbole using diseases like ""heart attack"" or ""cancer"" for
emphasis, and not as a health self-report. This problem is even more
challenging for rarely reported, or frequent but ambiguously expressed
conditions, such as ""stroke"". To address this problem, we propose a general,
robust method for detecting PHMs in social media, which we call WESPAD, that
combines lexical, syntactic, word embedding-based, and context-based features.
WESPAD is able to generalize from few examples by automatically distorting the
word embedding space to most effectively detect the true health mentions.
Unlike previously proposed state-of-the-art supervised and deep-learning
techniques, WESPAD requires relatively little training data, which makes it
possible to adapt, with minimal effort, to each new disease and condition. We
evaluate WESPAD on both an established publicly available Flu detection
benchmark, and on a new dataset that we have constructed with mentions of
multiple health conditions. Our experiments show that WESPAD outperforms the
baselines and state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases when the number and
proportion of true health mentions in the training data is small.

quantum ballistic regime. Our simulation shows that device 'on' current can be
improved by inserting a WS2 monolayer between two MoS2 monolayers. Application
of biaxial tensile strain reveals a reduction in drain current which can be
attributed to the lowering of carrier effective mass with increased tensile
strain. In addition, it is found that gate underlap geometry improves
electrostatic device performance by improving sub-threshold swing. However,
increase in channel resistance reduces drain current. Besides exploring the
prospect of these materials in device performance, novel trilayer TMDC
heterostructure double gate Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are proposed for
sensing Nano biomolecules as well as for pH sensing. Bottom gate operation
ensures these FETs operating beyond Nernst limit of 59 mV/pH. Simulation
results found in this work reveal that scaling of bottom gate oxide results in
better sensitivity while top oxide scaling exhibits an opposite trend. It is
also found that, for identical operating conditions, proposed TMDC FET pH
sensors show super-Nernst sensitivity indicating these materials as potential
candidates in implementing such sensor. Besides pH sensing, all these materials
show high sensitivity in the sub-threshold region as a channel material in
nanobiosensor while MoS2/WS2/MoS2 FET shows the least sensitivity among them.

attitude error. We show that the popular use of the skew-symmetric part of the
rotation matrix is problematic from a safety perspective, and specifically that
the closed loop system may linger at large attitude errors for an arbitrary

proposed controller prioritizes the error in the vehicle thrust direction, and
is shown to outperform a similar, existing controller from the literature.
Stability follows via a Lyapunov function, and the controller is validated in

human actions is essential for targeted recommendations that could improve our

predictions is extremely difficult due to the complexities of human behavior,
which consists of a large number of potential actions that vary over time,
depend on each other, and are periodic. Previous work has not jointly modeled
these dynamics and has largely focused on item consumption patterns instead of
broader types of behaviors such as eating, commuting or exercising. In this
work, we develop a novel statistical model for Time-varying, Interdependent,
and Periodic Action Sequences. Our approach is based on personalized,
multivariate temporal point processes that model time-varying action
propensities through a mixture of Gaussian intensities. Our model captures
short-term and long-term periodic interdependencies between actions through
Hawkes process-based self-excitations. We evaluate our approach on two activity
logging datasets comprising 12 million actions taken by 20 thousand users over
17 months. We demonstrate that our approach allows us to make successful
predictions of future user actions and their timing. Specifically, our model
improves predictions of actions, and their timing, over existing methods across
multiple datasets by up to 156%, and up to 37%, respectively. Performance
improvements are particularly large for relatively rare and periodic actions
such as walking and biking, improving over baselines by up to 256%. This
demonstrates that explicit modeling of dependencies and periodicities in
real-world behavior enables successful predictions of future actions, with
implications for modeling human behavior, app personalization, and targeting of
health interventions.

the challenging case of the critical traveling waves with oscillations. We
prove that, the critical oscillatory traveling waves are globally stable with

models, most current treatments employ the so-called static approximation to
simplify the process of summing over all possible paths. Although sufficient
for studying the thermodynamic aspects of the system, static approximation
ignores the contributions made by time-dependent, or non-static, fluctuations
in the paths of the path integral. This non-static component is very small
relative to the static part, and its careful treatment is necessary for the
calculation of small non-extensive quantities such as the energy gap within the
path integral framework. We propose a formalism for incorporating non-static
effects into the path integral calculation of a class of spin models whose
partition functions are reducible to the trace of a single spin (often known as
the effective Hamiltonian). We first show that the time-dependent behavior of
the single spin trace is governed by the Pauli equation. Time-dependent
perturbation theory is used to obtain a perturbative expansion of the solution
of the Pauli equation, and then for the single spin trace. This gives us a
perturbative expansion of the path integral which can be integrated
systematically using standard techniques. In this paper, we develop the
theoretical framework outlined above in detail and apply it to a simple ordered
spin model, the infinite-range ferromagnetic Ising model in a transverse field.
We calculated two non-extensive quantites with this non-static approach: the
$N^0$ and $N^{-1}$ terms of the ground-state energy ($N$=number of spins) and
the energy gap between the ground and first-excited states. We checked our
results by comparing with those of Holstein-Primakoff transform and numerical
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. The application of the method to quantum
spin-glasses is briefly discussed.

U3Ni3Sn4 by the Bridgman method and the Fermi surface properties detected by de
Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) experiments. We have also investigated single-crystal
U3Ni3Sn4 by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetization, electrical
resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The angular dependence of the dHvA
frequencies reveals many closed Fermi surfaces, which are nearly spherical in
topology. The experimental results are in good agreement with local density
approximation (LDA) band structure calculations based on the 5f-itinerant
model. The band structure calculation predicts many Fermi surfaces, mostly with
spherical shape, derived from 12 bands crossing the Fermi energy. To our
knowledge, the splitting of Fermi surfaces due to the non-centrosymmetric
crystal in 5f-electron systems is experimentally detected for the first time.
The temperature dependence of the dHvA amplitude reveals a large cyclotron
effective mass of up to 35m0, indicating the heavy electronic state of U3Ni3Sn4
due to the proximity of the quantum critical point. From the field dependence
of the dHvA amplitude, a mean free path of conduction electrons of up to 1950A
is detected, reflecting the good quality of the grown crystal. The small
splitting energy related to the antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction is most
likely due to the large cyclotron effective mass.

plumes have been observed in seep sites globally on shallow continental
shelves, and emerging industry of methane hydrates mining causes growing
environmental concern on possible disastrous blowout which destabilizes the
methane hydrate and releases huge amount of methane gas. To better estimate how
much methane in gaseous phase leaked from the seeps can reach the atmosphere, a
simplified model is developed to simulate the ascent of a methane bubble from a
shallow ocean methane seep, and the methane transfer with the surrounding
water. The breakup and coalescence of bubbles are neglected, and the bubble is
assumed to remain spherical following a vertical path during the whole rising
process. We calculated the survival distance of bubbles with varying initial
sizes and depths and the remaining percentage of methane reaching the sea
surface, and applied the results to the seep sites in the Shenhu area in the
South China Sea. The study can provide insight into the relative significance
of different water bodies in contributing to the atmosphere greenhouse gas.

ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). The stringent requirements of

problem is even more challenging for the services beyond the 5G promise, such

URLLC do not allow traditional approaches such as re-transmission to be used to
increase the reliability. On the other hand, to guarantee the delay
requirements, the block length needs to be small, so conventional channel
codes, originally designed and optimised for moderate-to-long block-lengths,
show notable deficiencies for short blocks. This paper provides an overview on
channel coding techniques for short block lengths and compares them in terms of
performance and complexity. Several important research directions are
identified and discussed in more detail with several possible solutions.

encoder receives input symbols one per unit time from an i.i.d. source and
submits binary codewords to a FIFO buffer that transmits bits at a fixed rate
to a receiver/decoder. Each input symbol at the encoder is viewed as a status
update by the source and the system performance is characterized by the status
update age, defined as the number of time units (symbols) the decoder output
lags behind the encoder input. An upper bound on the average status age is
derived from the exponential bound on the probability of error in streaming
source coding with delay. Apart from the influence of the error exponent that
describes the convergence of the error, this upper bound also scales with the
constant multiplier term in the error probability. However, the error exponent
does not lead to an accurate description of the status age for small delay and
small blocklength. An age optimal block coding scheme is proposed based on an
approximation of the average age by converting the streaming source coding
system into a D/G/1 queue. We compare this scheme to the error exponent optimal
coding scheme which uses the method of types. We show that maximizing the error
exponent is not equivalent to minimizing the average status age.

the hint-guided approach into crowdsourcing to deal with this challenge. Our

questions. Specifically, we propose a hybrid-stage setting, consisting of the
main stage and the hint stage. When workers face any uncertain question on the
main stage, they are allowed to enter the hint stage and look up hints before
making any answer. A unique payment mechanism that meets two important design
principles for crowdsourcing is developed. Besides, the proposed mechanism
further encourages high-quality workers less using hints, which helps identify
and assigns larger possible payment to them. Experiments are performed on
Amazon Mechanical Turk, which show that our approach ensures a sufficient
number of high-quality labels with low expenditure and detects high-quality
workers.

multiple halo properties using Gaussian process regression. Using a
$\Lambda$CDM $N$-body simulation, we carry out a comprehensive study of the
joint bias dependence on halo structure, formation history and environment. We
show that the bias is a multivariate function of halo properties that falls
into three regimes. For massive haloes, halo mass explains the majority of bias
variation. For early-forming haloes, bias depends sensitively on the recent
mass accretion history. For low-mass and late-forming haloes, bias depends more
on the structure of a halo such as its shape and spin. Our framework enables us
to convincingly prove that $V_\mathrm{max}/V_\mathrm{vir}$ is a lossy proxy of
formation time for bias modelling, whereas the mass, spin, shape and formation
time variables are non-redundant with respect to each other. Combining mass and
formation time largely accounts for the mass accretion history dependence of
bias. Combining all the internal halo properties fully accounts for the density
profile dependence inside haloes, and predicts the clustering variation of
individual haloes to a $20\%$ level at $\sim 10\mathrm{Mpc}h^{-1}$. When an
environmental density is measured outside $1\mathrm{Mpc}h^{-1}$ from the halo
centre, it outperforms and largely accounts for the bias dependence on the
internal halo structure, explaining the bias variation above a level of $30\%$.

temperatures can form a viscous fluid. We develop a theory of high-frequency
magnetotransport in such fluid. The time dispersion of viscosity should be
taken into account at the frequencies about and above the rate of
electron-electron collisions. We show that the shear viscosity coefficients as
functions of magnetic field and frequency have the only resonance at the
frequency equal to the doubled cyclotron frequency. We demonstrate that such
resonance manifests itself in the plasmon damping. Apparently, the predicted
resonance is also responsible for the peaks and features in photoresistance and
photovoltage, recently observed on the best-quality GaAs quantum wells. The
last fact should considered as an important evidence of forming a viscous
electron fluid in such structures.

and regular expression operators can reach 72-99% of the throughput of an
all-knowing oracle that always selects the optimal algorithm, even when
individual physical operators are up to 105x slower than the optimal.
Additionally, Cuttlefish achieves join throughput improvements of up to 7.5x

oscillating driving field tuned to the fundamental eigenfrequency, the Py/Fe

effect leads to significantly more rapid vortex core (VC) reversal in
comparison to homogeneous disks. Our work demonstrates that the higher order
modes can drive much faster VC reversal than the fundamental mode, in sharp
contrast to the results obtained in homogeneous disks. With excitation levels
up to 30 mT, we find strong nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in the system, which
results in mode frequency redshifting, therefore the observation of the most
rapid VC reversals below eigenfrequencies and VC switching in wide ranges of

source term of only one equation. It is localized in some arbitrary nonempty
open subset $\omega$ of the domain $\Omega$. First, we prove a global
null-controllability result when the coupling term in the second equation is an
odd power. As the linearized system around zero is not null-controllable, the
usual strategy consists in using the return method, introduced by Jean-Michel
Coron, or the method of power series expansions. In this paper, we give a
direct nonlinear proof, which relies on a new duality method that we call
Reflexive Uniqueness Method. It is a variation in reflexive Banach spaces of
the well-known Hilbert Uniqueness Method, introduced by Jacques-Louis Lions. It
is based on Carleman estimates in $L^p$ ($2 \leq p < \infty$) obtained from the
usual Carleman inequality in $L^2$ and parabolic regularity arguments. This
strategy enables us to find a control of the heat equation, which is an odd
power of a regular function. Another advantage of the method is to produce
small controls for small initial data. Secondly, thanks to the return method,
we also prove a null-controllability result for more general nonlinear
reaction-diffusion systems, where the coupling term in the second equation
behaves as an odd power at zero.

economics, migration, population etc. In this paper, we propose a set of
methods to model the dynamics of the spreading system. To model the randomness
of language spreading, we propose the Batch Markov Monte Carlo Simulation with
Migration(BMMCSM) algorithm, in which each agent is treated as a language
stack. The agent learns languages and migrates based on the proposed Batch
Markov Property according to the transition matrix T and migration matrix M.
Since population plays a crucial role in language spreading, we also introduce
the Mortality and Fertility Mechanism, which controls the birth and death of
the simulated agents, into the BMMCSM algorithm. The simulation results of
BMMCSM show that the numerical and geographic distribution of languages varies
across the time. The change of distribution fits the world cultural and
economic development trend. Next, when we construct Matrix T, there are some
entries of T can be directly calculated from historical statistics while some
entries of T is unknown. Thus, the key to the success of the BMMCSM lies in the
accurate estimation of transition matrix T by estimating the unknown entries of
T under the supervision of the known entries. To achieve this, we first
construct a 20 by 20 by 5 factor tensor X to characterize each entry of T. Then
we train a Random Forest Regressor on the known entries of T and use the
trained regressor to predict the unknown entries. The reason why we choose
Random Forest(RF) is that, compared to Single Decision Tree, it conquers the
problem of over fitting and the Shapiro test also suggests that the residual of
RF subjects to the Normal distribution.

of the unperturbed system at the point $(0,0)$ is controllable and that
disturbance $w(x,t)$ is asymptotically sufficiently small, there exists a
state-feedback controller of the form $u=-Kx$ such that the perturbed system
preserves the local asymptotic stability of the zero solution of unperturbed
system. The main result of this paper gives the sufficient conditions, more
specifically, the relations between the important parameters of the system, to
ensure this property and at the same time provides the method for calculating
the lower bound of region of attraction. Moreover, we obtain a nontrivial
extension of the classical result of H. K. Khalil regarding asymptotic behavior
of the (uncontrolled) perturbed systems whose nominal part is exponentially
asymptotically stable at the origin $x=0.$

for remote reactor monitoring in the field of nuclear safety. Using Monte Carlo
(MC) based GEANT4 simulation, numerous parameters influencing the light
collection and thereby the energy resolution of the antineutrino detector
module are studied: e.g., degrees of scintillator surface roughness, reflector
type, and its ap- plying method onto scintillator and light guide surface, the
reflectivity of the reflector, light guide geometries and diameter of the
photocathode. The impact of each parameter is inves- tigated by looking at the
detected spectrum, i.e. the number photoelectrons per depositing energy. In
addition, the average light collection efficiency of the detector module and
its spatial variation are calculated for each simulation setup. According to
the simulation re- sults, it is found that photocathode size, light guide
shape, reflectivity of reflecting material and wrapping method show a
significant impact on the light collection efficiency while scin- tillator
surface polishing level and the choose of reflector type show relatively less
impact. This study demonstrates that these parameters are very important in the
design of plastic scintillator included antineutrino detectors to improve the

becomes very challenging for large datasets. In this paper, we focus on the
popular $k$-center variant which, given a set $S$ of points from some metric
space and a parameter $k<|S|$, requires to identify a subset of $k$ centers in
$S$ minimizing the maximum distance of any point of $S$ from its closest
center. A more general formulation, introduced to deal with noisy datasets,
features a further parameter $z$ and allows up to $z$ points of $S$ (outliers)
to be disregarded when computing the maximum distance from the centers. We
present coreset-based 2-round MapReduce algorithms for the above two
formulations of the problem, and a 1-pass Streaming algorithm for the case with
outliers. For any fixed $\epsilon>0$, the algorithms yield solutions whose
approximation ratios are a mere additive term $\epsilon$ away from those
achievable by the best known polynomial-time sequential algorithms, a result
that substantially improves upon the state of the art. Our algorithms are
rather simple and adapt to the intrinsic complexity of the dataset, captured by
the doubling dimension $D$ of the metric space. Specifically, our analysis
shows that the algorithms become very space-efficient for the important case of
small (constant) $D$. These theoretical results are complemented with a set of
experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets of up to over a billion
points, which show that our algorithms yield better quality solutions over the
state of the art while featuring excellent scalability, and that they also lend
themselves to sequential implementations much faster than existing ones.

The strong
equivalence principle (SEP) constitutes a collection of gravitational
symmetries which are all implemented by general relativity. Alternative
theories, however, are generally expected to violate some aspects of SEP. We
test three aspects of SEP using observed change rates in the orbital period and
eccentricity of binary pulsar J1713+0747: 1. the gravitational constant's
constancy as part of locational invariance of gravitation; 2. the
post-Newtonian parameter $\hat{\alpha}_3$ in gravitational Lorentz invariance;
3. the universality of free fall (UFF) for strongly self-gravitating bodies.
Based on the pulsar timing result of the combined dataset from the North
American Nanohertz Gravitational Observatory (NANOGrav) and the European Pulsar
Timing Array (EPTA), we find $\dot{G}/G = (-0.1 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{-12}\,{\rm

the magnetic field diffusion through a conductive medium. The structure of
magnetic fields supported by electric current sources is thoroughly modelled.
The source of electric current is considered as an elongated volume of finite
cross-section being immersed in a conductive medium. To model the unipolarity
feature of the observed pulses prior to and at the earthquake main shock, the
electric current of the source is of impulse form. Special attention is paid to
the differences in the pulse structure (as amplitude envelope and the pulse

analysis and comparison with recorded magnetic field pulse characteristics
reveal that the observed unipolar pulses may have a common genesis, an electric

relatively high level of clustering, as quantified by the parameter $\sigma_8$,
found in cosmic microwave background experiments and the smaller one obtained
from large-scale observations in the late Universe. In this paper we show that
coupled quintessence, i.e. a single dark energy scalar field conformally
coupled to dark matter through a constant coupling, can solve this problem if
the background is taken to be identical to the $\Lambda$CDM one. We show that
two competing effects arise. On one hand, the additional scalar force is
attractive, and is therefore expected to increase the clustering. On the other,
in order to obtain the same background as $\Lambda$CDM, coupled quintessence
must have a smaller amount of dark matter near the present epoch. We show that
the second effect is dominating today and leads to an overall slower growth.
Comparing to redshift distortion data, we find that coupled quintessence with
$\Lambda$CDM background solves the tension between early and late clustering.
We find for the coupling $\beta$ and for $\sigma_8$ the best fit values
$|\beta| = 0.079^{+ 0.059}_{- 0.067}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.818^{+0.115}_{-0.088}$.
These values also fit the lensing data from the KiDS-450 survey. We also
estimate that the future missions SKA and Euclid will constrain $\beta$ with an
error of $\pm\, 1.5\times10^{-3}$ and for $\sigma_8$ of $\pm
\,1.8\times10^{-3}$ at $1\sigma$ level.

the third generation leptons, like $\tau\to 3\mu$. In this paper, we explore
how far the nature of NP can be unraveled at the next generation $B$-factories
like Belle-II, provided the decay $\tau\to 3\mu$ has been observed. We use four
observables with which the differentiation among NP operators may be achieved
to a high confidence level. Possible presence of multiple NP operators are also
analysed with the Optimal Observable technique. While the analysis can be
improved even further if the final state muon polarisations are measured, we
present this work as a motivational tool for the experimentalists, as well as a
template for the analysis of similar processes.

the eigenvectors form a simplex of the speakers' probabilities. Time frames

utilizing the identified sets of frames, and a linear umixing is performed to
extract the individual speakers. The derived simplexes are visually

restricted to 1D models that cannot account for 3D dynamical processes. In this
work we couple a chemical relaxation scheme to the UM to account for the
chemical interconversion of methane and carbon monoxide. This is done
consistently with the radiative transfer meaning that departures from chemical
equilibrium are included in the heating rates (and emission) and hence complete
the feedback between the dynamics, thermal structure and chemical composition.
In this letter we simulate the well studied atmosphere of HD~209458b. We find
that the combined effect of horizontal and vertical advection leads to an
increase in the methane abundance by several orders of magnitude; directly
opposite to the trend found in previous works. Our results demonstrate the need
to include 3D effects when considering the chemistry of hot Jupiter
atmospheres. We calculate transmission and emission spectra, as well as the
emission phase curve, from our simulations. We conclude that gas-phase

SgrB2(M) was observed with the ALMA in a spectral line survey from 211 to 275
GHz. This frequency range includes several transitions of CH3CN (including
isotopologues and vibrationally excited states). We employ the
three-dimensional radiative transfer toolbox Pandora in order to retrieve the
velocity and abundance field by modeling different CH3CN lines. For this
purpose, we base our model on the results of a previous study that determined
the physical structure of SgrB2(M), i.e.\ the distribution of dust dense cores,
ionized regions and heating sources. The morphology of the CH3CN emission can
be reproduced by a molecular density field that consists of a superposition of
cores with modified Plummer-like density profiles. The averaged relative
abundance of CH3CN with respect to H2 ranges from 4x10^{-11} to 2x10^{-8} in
the northern part of SgrB2(M) and from 2x10^{-10} to 5x10^{-7} in the southern
part. In general, we find that the relative abundance of CH3CN is lower at the
center of the very dense and hot cores, causing the general morphology of the
CH3CN emission to be shifted with respect to the dust continuum emission. The
dust temperature calculated by the radiative transfer simulation based on the
available luminosity reaches values up to 900 K. However, in some regions
vibrationally excited transitions of CH3CN are underestimated by the model,
indicating that the predicted gas temperature, which is assumed to be equal to
the dust temperature, is partly underestimated. The determination of the
velocity component along the line of sight reveals that a velocity gradient
from the north to the south exists in SgrB2(M).

essential task in the context of developing real-time or safety-critical
software, but it is also a complex and error-prone process. Conventional
approaches require at least some manual inputs from the user, such as loop
bounds and infeasible path information, which are hard to obtain and can lead
to unsafe results if they are incorrect. This is aggravated by the lack of a
comprehensive explanation of the WCET estimate, i.e., a specific trace showing
how WCET was reached. It is therefore hard to spot incorrect inputs and hard to
improve the worst-case timing of the application. Meanwhile, modern processors
have reached a complexity that refutes analysis and puts more and more burden
on the practitioner. In this article we show how all of these issues can be
significantly mitigated or even solved, if we use processors that are amenable
to WCET analysis. We define and identify such processors, and then we propose
an automated tool set which estimates a precise WCET without unsafe manual
inputs, and also reconstructs a maximum-detail view of the WCET path that can
be examined in a debugger environment. Our approach is based on Model Checking,
which however is known to scale badly with growing application size. We address
this issue by shifting the analysis to source code level, where source code
transformations can be applied that retain the timing behavior, but reduce the

of long flexible cylinders in an offshore environment is proposed. In
particular the focus is on the modelling of the vortex induced vibrations (VIV)
and the aim is the development of a model capable of capturing both the in-line
and cross-flow oscillations. The reduced order model is identified starting
from the results of a high fidelity solver developed coupling together a Finite
Element Solver (FEM) with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver. The high
fidelity analyses are conducted on a reduced domain size representing a small
section of the long cylinder, which is nevertheless, already flexible. The
section is forced using a motion which matches the expected motion in full
scale, and the results are used for the system-parameter identification of the
reduced order model. The reduced order model is identified by using a system
and parameter identification approach. The final proposed model consists in the
combination of a forced van der Pol oscillator, to model the cross-flow forces,
and a linear state-space model, to model the in-line forces. The model is
applied to study a full scale flexible model and the results are validated by
using experiments conducted on a flexible riser inside a towing tank.

hard thresholding. Its key advantage is that it assumes no explicit model

and attains desirable asymptotic sparsistency. The proposed algorithm can be
adapted to any reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with different kernel

can be further improved through parallel computing. The sparsistency of the

also supported by a variety of simulated and real examples.

that outperforms human intelligence, even if limited knowledge and data are

this goal. In this work, we consider a specific task from quantum physics, i.e.
quantum state transfer in a one-dimensional spin chain. The mission for the
machine is to find transfer schemes with fastest speeds while maintaining high
transfer fidelities. The first scenario we consider is when the Hamiltonian is
time-independent. We update the coupling strength by minimizing a loss function
dependent on both the fidelity and the speed. Compared with a scheme proven to
be at the quantum speed limit for the perfect state transfer, the scheme
provided by RL is faster while maintaining the infidelity below $5\times
10^{-4}$. In the second scenario where a time-dependent external field is
introduced, we convert the state transfer process into a Markov decision
process that can be understood by the machine. We solve it with the deep
Q-learning algorithm. After training, the machine successfully finds transfer
schemes with high fidelities and speeds, which are faster than previously known
ones. These results show that Reinforcement Learning can be a powerful tool for
quantum control problems.

degrees are first order definable within Ceers. There is no least, no maximal,
no greatest dark degree, but there are infinitely many minimal dark degrees. We
study joins and meets in Ceers, addressing the cases when two incomparable
degrees of ceers X,Y have or do not have join or meet according to where X,Y
are located in the classes of the aforementioned partition: in particular no
pair of dark ceers has join, and no pair in which at least one ceer is dark has
meet. We also exhibit examples of ceers X,Y having join which coincides with
their uniform join, but also examples when their join is strictly less than the
uniform join. We study join-irreducibility and meet-irreducibility. In

Existing commercial equipment is designed for infrastructure making it
unsuitable for vehicular applications requiring low weight and unlicensed band
support (e.g. 5.9 GHz ITS-band). In this work, we present tinyLTE, a system
design which provides fully autonomous, multi-purpose and ultra-compact LTE
cells by utilizing existing open source eNB and EPC implementations. Due to its
small form factor and low weight, the tinyLTE system enables mobile deployment
on board of cars and drones as well as smooth integration with existing
roadside infrastructure. Additionally, the standalone design allows for systems
to be chained in a multi-hop configuration. The paper describes the lean and
low-cost design concept and implementation followed by a performance evaluation
for single and two-hop configurations at 5.9 GHz. The results from both lab and
field experiments validate the feasibility of the tinyLTE approach and
demonstrate its potential to even support real-time vehicular applications

to quantify first- and second-order influences of these parameters on volcanic
outgassing after 4.5 Gyrs of evolution. Given commonly observed astrophysical
data of super-Earths, we identify a range of possible interior structures and
compositions by employing Bayesian inference modelling. [..] The identified
interiors are subsequently used as input for two-dimensional (2-D) convection
models to study partial melting, depletion, and outgassing rates of CO2. In
total, we model depletion and outgassing for an extensive set of more than 2300
different super-Earth cases. We find that there is a mass range for which
outgassing is most efficient (~2--3 ME, depending on thermal state) and an
upper mass where outgassing becomes very inefficient (~5--7 \ME, depending on
thermal state). [..] In summary, depletion and outgassing are mainly influenced
by planet mass and thermal state. Interior structure and composition only
moderately affect outgassing. The majority of outgassing occurs before 4.5
Gyrs, especially for planets below 3 ME. We conclude that for stagnant-lid
planets, (1) compositional and structural properties have secondary influence
on outgassing compared to planet mass and thermal state, and (2) confirm that
there is a mass range for which outgassing is most efficient and an upper mass
limit, above which no significant outgassing can occur. Our predicted trend of
CO2-atmospheric masses can be observationally tested for exoplanets. These

the lack of a centralized authority that can enforce the optimal outcome. At
its antipodes, mechanism design studies how to ameliorate these effects by
incentivizing socially desirable behavior and implementing the optimal state as
equilibrium. In practice, the responsiveness to such measures depends on the
wealth of each individual. This leads to a natural, but largely unexplored,
question. Does optimal mechanism design entrench, or maybe even exacerbate,
social inequality?
  We study this question in nonatomic congestion games, arguably one of the
most thoroughly studied settings from the perspectives of price of anarchy as
well as mechanism design. We introduce a new model that incorporates the wealth
distribution of the population and captures the income elasticity of travel
time. This allows us to argue about the equality of wealth distribution both
before and after employing a mechanism. We start our analysis by establishing a
broad qualitative result, showing that tolls always increase inequality in
symmetric congestion games under any reasonable metric of inequality, e.g., the
Gini index. Next, we introduce the iniquity index, a novel measure for
quantifying the magnitude of these forces towards a more unbalanced wealth
distribution and show it has good normative properties (robustness to scaling
of income, no-regret learning). We analyze iniquity both in theoretical
settings (Pigou's network under various wealth distributions) as well as
experimental ones (based on a large scale field experiment in Singapore).
Finally, we provide an algorithm for computing optimal tolls for any point of
the trade-off of relative importance of efficiency and equality. We conclude
with a discussion of our findings in the context of theories of justice as
developed in contemporary social sciences.

problem. In this paper, a newly-invented mathematical method called persistent
homology is introduced, for the first time, to quantitatively analyze the
intrinsic topological properties of ion aggregation systems and
hydrogen-bonding networks. Two most distinguishable properties of persistent
homology analysis of assembly systems are as follows. First, it does not
require a predefined bond length to construct the ion or hydrogen network.
Persistent homology results are determined by the morphological structure of
the data only. Second, it can directly measure the size of circles or holes in
ion aggregates and hydrogen-bonding networks. To validate our model, we
consider two well-studied systems, i.e., NaCl and KSCN solutions, generated
from molecular dynamics simulations. They are believed to represent two
morphological types of aggregation, i.e., local clusters and extended ion
network. It has been found that the two aggregation types have distinguishable
topological features and can be characterized by our topological model very
well. For hydrogen-bonding networks, KSCN systems demonstrate much more
dramatic variations in their local circle structures with the concentration
increase. A consistent increase of large-sized local circle structures is
observed and the sizes of these circles become more and more diverse. In
contrast, NaCl systems show no obvious increase of large-sized circles. Instead
a consistent decline of the average size of circle structures is observed and
the sizes of these circles become more and more uniformed with the
concentration increase.

DCO$^+$ emission in the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 169142. We explore
the sensitivity of the DCO$^+$ formation pathways to the gas temperature and
the CO abundance. The DCO$^+$ $J$=3-2 transition was observed with ALMA at a
spatial resolution of 0.3"". The HD 169142 DCO$^+$ radial intensity profile
reveals a warm, inner component at radii <30 AU and a broad, ring-like
structure from ~50-230 AU with a peak at 100 AU just beyond the millimeter
grain edge. We modeled DCO$^+$ emission in HD 169142 with a physical disk
structure adapted from the literature, and employed a simple deuterium chemical
network to investigate the formation of DCO$^+$ through the cold deuterium
fractionation pathway via H$_2$D$^+$. Contributions from the warm deuterium
fractionation pathway via CH$_2$D$^+$ are approximated using a constant
abundance in the intermediate disk layers. Parameterized models show that
alterations to the midplane gas temperature and CO abundance of the literature
model are both needed to recover the observed DCO$^+$ radial intensity profile.
The best-fit model contains a shadowed, cold midplane in the region z/r < 0.1
with an 8 K decrease in gas temperature and a factor of five CO depletion just
beyond the millimeter grain edge, and a 2 K decrease in gas temperature for r >
120 AU. The warm deuterium fractionation pathway is implemented as a constant
DCO$^+$ abundance of 2.0$\times$10$^{-12}$ between 30-70 K. The DCO$^+$
emission probes a reservoir of cold material in the HD 169142 outer disk that
is not revealed by the millimeter continuum, the SED, nor the emission from the
12CO, 13CO, or C18O $J$=2-1 lines.

[Phys. Rev. B $\bf{94}$, 201407 (2016)], the active vibrational degrees of
freedom are treated in the reservoir subspace and are integrated out. This
facilitates applications to systems with very high excitation levels, for
example due to current-induced heating, while properties of the vibrational
degrees of freedom, such as the excitation level and other moments of the
vibrational distribution function, are still accessible. The method is applied
to a generic model of a nanosystem, which comprises a single electronic level
that is coupled to fermionic leads and a vibrational degree of freedom.
Converged results are obtained in a broad spectrum of parameters, ranging from
the nonadiabatic to the adiabatic transport regime. We specifically investigate
the phenomenon of vibrational instability, that is, the increase of
current-induced vibrational excitation for decreasing electronic-vibrational
coupling. The novel HQME approach allows us to analyze the influence of level
broadening due to both molecule-lead coupling and thermal effects. Results
obtained for the first two moments suggest that the vibrational excitation is
always described by a geometric distribution in the weak electronic-vibrational

systems. Therefore, understanding the formation and evolution of circumbinary
disks is crucial for a complete scenario of planet formation. The aim of this
paper is to present the detection of a circumbinary disk around Oph-IRS67 and
analyse its structure. We present high-angular-resolution (0.4"", 60 AU)
observations of C17O, H13CO+ , C34S, SO2, C2H and c-C3H2 molecular transitions
with ALMA at 0.8 mm. The spectrally and spatially resolved maps reveal the
kinematics of the circumbinary disk as well as its chemistry. Molecular
abundances are estimated using RADEX. The continuum emission reveals the
presence of a circumbinary disk around the two sources. This disk has a
diameter of ~620 AU and is well traced by C17O and H13CO+ emission. C2H and
c-C3H2 trace a higher-density region which is spatially offset from the sources
(~430 AU). Finally, SO2 shows compact emission around one of the sources,
Oph-IRS67 B. The molecular transitions which trace the circumbinary disk are
consistent with a Keplerian profile on disk scales (< 200 AU) and an infalling
profile for envelope scales (> 200 AU). The Keplerian fit leads to a mass of
2.2 Msun. Inferred CO abundances w.r.t. H2 are comparable to the canonical ISM
value of 2.7e-4. This study proves the first detection of the circumbinary disk
associated with Oph-IRS67. The disk is chemically differentiated from the
nearby high-density region. The lack of methanol emission suggests the extended
disk dominates the mass budget in the inner- most regions of the protostellar
envelope, generating a flat density profile where less material is exposed to
high temperatures. Thus, complex organic molecules would be associated with
lower column densities. Finally, Oph-IRS67 is a promising candidate for the
detection of both circumstellar disks with higher-angular-resolution
observations.

almost or entirely thermal. In contrast, there are the so-called early
impulsive flares that do not show a (significant) preflare heating but instead
often show the Neupert effect--a relationship where the impulsive phase is
followed by a gradual, cumulative-like, thermal response. This has been
interpreted as a dominance of nonthermal energy release at the impulsive phase,
even though a similar phenomenology is expected if the thermal and nonthermal
energies are released in comparable amounts at the impulsive phase.
Nevertheless, some flares do show a good quantitative correspondence between
the nonthermal electron energy input and plasma heating, in such cases the
thermal response was weak, which results in calling them ""cold"" flares. We
undertook a systematic search of such events among early impulsive flares
registered by Konus-Wind instrument in the triggered mode from 11/1994 to
04/2017 and selected 27 cold flares based on relationships between HXR
(Konus-Wind) and SXR (GOES) emission. For these events we put together all
available microwave data from different instruments. We obtained temporal and
spectral parameters of HXR and microwave emissions of the events and examined
correlations between them. We found that, compared with a `mean' flare, the
cold flares: (i) are weaker, shorter, and harder in the X-ray domain, (ii) are
harder and shorter, but not weaker in the microwaves, (iii) have a
significantly higher spectral peak frequencies in the microwaves. We discuss
the possible physical reasons for these distinctions and implication of the
finding.

the axisymmetric Jeans equations on subsets representing the thin and thick

construct category-level models from CAD collections which are now widely

rendering pipeline that enables synthesis of large datasets from a limited
amount of manually labeled data. Using data thus synthesized, we learn
category-level models for object deformations in 3D, as well as discriminative
object features in 2D. These category models are instance-independent and aid
in the design of object landmark observations that can be incorporated into a
generic monocular SLAM framework. Where typical object-SLAM approaches usually
solve only for object and camera poses, we also estimate object shape
on-the-fly, allowing for a wide range of objects from the category to be
present in the scene. Moreover, since our 2D object features are learned
discriminatively, the proposed object-SLAM system succeeds in several scenarios
where sparse feature-based monocular SLAM fails due to insufficient features or
parallax. Also, the proposed category-models help in object instance retrieval,
useful for Augmented Reality (AR) applications. We evaluate the proposed
framework on multiple challenging real-world scenes and show --- to the best of
our knowledge --- first results of an instance-independent monocular
object-SLAM system and the benefits it enjoys over feature-based SLAM methods.

So far, most systems proposed are i) monolingual and ii) rely on a set of

present the first multilingual QALD pipeline that induces a model from training

DUDES (Dependency-based Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures)

multi-object tracking in urban driving scenarios. Using images from a monocular
camera alone, we devise pairwise costs for object tracks, based on several 3D
cues such as object pose, shape, and motion. The proposed costs are agnostic to
the data association method and can be incorporated into any optimization
framework to output the pairwise data associations. These costs are easy to
implement, can be computed in real-time, and complement each other to account
for possible errors in a tracking-by-detection framework. We perform an
extensive analysis of the designed costs and empirically demonstrate consistent
improvement over the state-of-the-art under varying conditions that employ a
range of object detectors, exhibit a variety in camera and object motions, and,
more importantly, are not reliant on the choice of the association framework.
We also show that, by using the simplest of associations frameworks (two-frame
Hungarian assignment), we surpass the state-of-the-art in multi-object-tracking

both the metric and the Palatini formulation of general relativity. We
investigate hilltop inflation in different parts of the Higgs potential and
calculate predictions for CMB observables. We run the renormalization group
equations up from the electroweak scale and down from the hilltop, adding a
jump in-between to account for unknown corrections in the intermediate regime.
Within our approximation, no viable hilltop inflation is possible for small
field values, where the non-minimal coupling has no role, nor for intermediate
field values. For large field values, hilltop inflation works. We find the
spectral index to be $n_s\leq0.96$ in both the metric and the Palatini
formulation, the upper bound coinciding with the tree-level result. The
tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r\leq1.2\times10^{-3}$ in the metric case and
$r\leq2.2\times10^{-9}$ in the Palatini case. Successful inflation is possible
even when the renormalization group running is continuous with no jumps. In the
metric formulation, $r$ is smaller than in Higgs inflation on the tree-level
plateau or at the critical point, making it possible to distinguish hilltop
inflation from these scenarios with next-generation CMB experiments.

effects of shock, fracture, and phase change in a variety of systems. Yet,
despite, the increasing interest in this area, far-from-equilibrium behaviours
of soft matter remain challenging to probe. Colloidal suspensions are often
used to visualise emergent behaviours in soft matter, as they offer precise
control of interparticle interactions, and ease of visualisation by optical
microscopy. However, previous studies have been limited to deformations that
are orders of magnitude too slow to be representative of extreme deformation.
Here we use a two-dimensional model system, a monolayer of colloids confined at
a fluid interface, to probe and visualise the evolution of the microstructure
during high-rate deformation driven by ultrasound. We observe the emergence of
a transient network of strings, and use discrete particle simulations to show
that it is caused by a delicate interplay of dynamic capillarity and
hydrodynamic interactions between particles oscillating at high-frequency.

tissue imaging. During the past decades, several techniques have been suggested
to estimate the tissue elasticity by measuring the displacement of the Carotid
vessel wall. Cross correlation-based methods are the most prevalent approaches
to measure the strain exerted in the wall vessel by the blood pressure. In the
case of a low pressure, the displacement is too small to be apparent in
ultrasound imaging, especially in the regions far from the center of the
vessel, causing a high error of displacement measurement. On the other hand,
increasing the compression leads to a relatively large displacement in the
regions near the center, which reduces the performance of the cross
correlation-based methods. In this study, a non-rigid image registration-based
technique is proposed to measure the tissue displacement for a relatively large
compression. The results show that the error of the displacement measurement
obtained by the proposed method is reduced by increasing the amount of
compression while the error of the cross correlationbased method rises for a
relatively large compression. We also used the synthetic aperture imaging
method, benefiting the directivity diagram, to improve the image quality,
especially in the superficial regions. The best relative root-mean-square error
(RMSE) of the proposed method and the adaptive cross correlation method were
4.5% and 6%, respectively. Consequently, the proposed algorithm outperforms the
conventional method and reduces the relative RMSE by 25%.

in experiments the short-time self diffusive behavior is strongly affected by
hydrodynamic effects and leads to a significant decrease in the respective
mean-squared displacement. In contrast, and in accordance with previous
simulation studies, the present DDFT which neglects hydrodynamic effects, shows
no dependence on the particle density for this quantity.

in a spectroscopic region separated from the two-spinon continuum. Our results
provide the first direct measurement of four-spinon excitations, which is made
possible by the fundamentally different correlation functions probed by RIXS
compared to INS. This advance holds great promise as a tool in the search for
novel quantum states, in particular quantum spin liquids.

micro-/nano-scale. This paper investigates the effects of surface tension on
the two-dimensional contact problems of an elastic layer bonded to the rigid
substrate. Under the plane strain assumption, the elastic field induced by a
uniformly distributed pressure within a finite width is formulated by applying
the Fourier integral transform, and the limiting process leading to the
solutions for a line force brings the requisite surface Greens function. For
the indentation of an elastic layer by a rigid cylinder, the corresponding
singular integral equation is derived, and subsequently solved by using an
effective numerical method based on Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature formula. It is
found from the theoretical and numerical results that the existence of surface
tension strongly enhances the hardness of the elastic layer and significantly
affects the distribution of contact pressure, when the size of contact region
is comparable to the elastocapillary length. In addition, an approximated
relationship between external load and half-width of contact is generalized in
an explicit and concise form, which is useful and convenient for practical
applications.

the polynomial calculus with bounded degree over the rationals solves precisely
the problems definable in fixed-point logic with counting. We also study the
bounded-degree polynomial calculus. Over the rationals, it captures fixed-point

mathematics. In the language of continued fractions, it can be stated by saying
that the orbits of rational points under the Gauss map x-->{1/x} eventually
reach zero. Analogues of this fact for Gauss maps defined over quadratic number
fields have relevance in the theory of flows on translation surfaces, and have
been established via powerful machinery, ultimately relying on the Veech
dichotomy. In this paper, for each commensurability class of noncocompact
triangle groups of quadratic invariant trace field, we construct a Gauss map
whose defining matrices generate a group in the class; we then provide a direct
and self-contained proof of termination. As a byproduct, we provide a new proof
of the fact that noncocompact triangle groups of quadratic invariant trace
field have the projective line over that field as the set of cross-ratios of
cusps.
  Our proof is based on an analysis of the action of nonnegative matrices with
quadratic integer entries on the Weil height of points. As a consequence of the
analysis, we show that long symbolic sequences in the alphabet of our maps can
be effectively split into blocks of predetermined shape having the property
that the height of points which obey the sequence and belong to the base field
decreases strictly at each block end. Since the height cannot decrease
infinitely, the termination property follows.

obtained data cubes of Jupiter in the 1930--1943 cm$^{-1}$ spectral ranges
(around 5 $\mu$m), which probe the atmosphere in the 1--4 bar region, with a
spectral resolution of $\approx$ 0.15 cm$^{-1}$ and an angular resolution of

radiative transfer model with a non-linear optimal estimation inversion method.
The inversion retrieves the vertical abundance profiles of NH$_3$ - which is
the main contributor at these wavelengths - with a maximum sensitivity at
$\approx$ 1--3 bar, as well as the cloud transmittance. This retrieval is
performed on over more than one thousand pixels of our data cubes, producing
maps of the disk, where all the major belts are visible. We present our
retrieved NH$_3$ abundance maps which can be compared with the distribution
observed by Juno's MWR (Bolton et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017) in the 2 bar

atmospheric dynamics. We are able to show important latitudinal variations -
such as in the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), where the NH$_3$ abundance is
observed to drop down to 60 ppmv at 2 bar - as well as longitudinal
variability. In the zones, we find the NH$_3$ abundance to increase with depth,
from 100 $\pm$ 15 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 $\pm$ 30 ppmv at 3 bar. We also display
the cloud transmittance--NH$_3$ abundance relationship, and find different

model, we are able to fit this relationship, at least in the NEB, including
either NH$_3$-ice or NH$_4$SH particles with sizes between 10 and 100 $\mu$m.

fluctuations across a ring of non-identical, non-linear electronic oscillators
become entrained into spatially-structured patterns. According to linear models
and mutual information, synchronization and causality dip at a certain
distance, then recover before eventually fading. Here, the underlying mechanism
is finally elucidated through novel experiments and simulations. The system
non-linearity is found to have a dual role: it supports chaotic dynamics, and
it enables energy exchange between the lower and higher sidebands of a
predominant frequency. This frequency acts as carrier signal in an arrangement
resembling standard amplitude modulation, wherein the lower sideband and the
demodulated baseband signals spectrally overlap. Due to a spatially-dependent
phase relationship, at a certain distance near-complete destructive
interference occurs between them, causing the observed dip. Methods suitable
for detecting non-trivial entrainment, such as transfer entropy and the
auxiliary system approach, nevertheless reveal that synchronization and
causality actually decrease with distance monotonically. Remoteness is,
therefore, arguably only apparent, as also reflected in the propagation of
external perturbations. These results demonstrate a complex mechanism of
dynamical interdependence, and exemplify how it can lead to incorrectly
inferring synchronization and causality.

  Transactions on Networking",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crowdsourced wireless community network enables individual users to share
their private Wi-Fi access points (APs) with each other, hence can achieve a
large Wi-Fi coverage with a small deployment cost via crowdsourcing. This paper
presents a novel contract-based incentive framework to incentivize such a Wi-Fi
network crowdsourcing under incomplete information (where each user has certain
private information such as mobility pattern and Wi-Fi access quality). In the
proposed framework, the network operator designs and offers a set of contract
items to users, each consisting of a Wi-Fi access price (that a user can charge
others for accessing his AP) and a subscription fee (that a user needs to pay
the operator for joining the community). Different from the existing contracts
in the literature, in our contract model each user's best choice depends not
only on his private information but also on other users' choices. This greatly
complicates the contract design, as the operator needs to analyze the
equilibrium choices of all users, rather than the best choice of each single
user. We first derive the feasible contract that guarantees the users' truthful
information disclosure based on the equilibrium analysis of user choice, and
then derive the optimal (and feasible) contract that yields the maximal profit
for the operator. Our analysis shows that a user who provides a higher Wi-Fi
access quality is more likely to choose a higher Wi-Fi access price and
subscription fee, regardless of the user mobility pattern. Simulation results
further show that when increasing the average Wi-Fi access quality of users,

(HDG) method for the approximation of the Cauchy formulation of the Stokes
equation using same degree of polynomials for the primal and mixed variables.
The novel formulation relies on the well-known Voigt notation to strongly
enforce the symmetry of the stress tensor. The proposed strategy introduces
several advantages with respect to the existing HDG formulations. First, it
remedies the suboptimal behavior experienced by the classical HDG method for
formulations involving the symmetric part of the gradient of the primal
variable. The optimal convergence of the mixed variable is retrieved and an
element-by-element post-process procedure leads to a superconvergent velocity
field, even for low-order approximations. Second, no additional enrichment of
the discrete spaces is required and a gain in computational efficiency follows
from reducing the quantity of stored information and the size of the local
problems. Eventually, the novel formulation naturally imposes physical
tractions on the Neumann boundary. Numerical validation of the optimality of
the method and its superconvergent properties is performed in 2D and 3D using
meshes of different element types.

cm-2 for HCS and 1.8e11 cm-2 for HSC, which translate to fractional abundances
relative to H2 of 2e-10 and 6e-12, respectively. Although the amount of sulfur
locked by these radicals is low, their detection allows to put interesting
constraints on the chemistry of sulfur in dark clouds. Interestingly, the
H2CS/HCS abundance ratio is found to be quite low, around 1, in contrast with
the oxygen analogue case, in which the H2CO/HCO abundance ratio is around 10 in
dark clouds. Moreover, the radical HCS is found to be more abundant than its
oxygen analogue, HCO. The metastable species HOC, the oxygen analogue of HSC,
has not been yet observed in space. These observational constraints are
confronted with the outcome of a recent model of the chemistry of sulfur in
dark clouds. The model underestimates the fractional abundance of HCS by at
least one order of magnitude, overestimates the H2CS/HCS abundance ratio, and
does not provide an abundance prediction for the metastable isomer HSC. These

maximized when auditors do not need to inspect socially responsible
corporations that account for pollution in their production decisions regarding
technology used and emission level. Starting with a well-mixed two-population
game model, there is no long-run equilibrium and the shares of polluters and
shirking auditors keep oscillating over time. In contrast, when firms and

depending on the inspecting cost. While the oscillatory behaviour is still

excessively high inspection cost leads to an ineffective auditing process where
the few compliant firms are driven out of the country.

are misspecified relative to the data generating process, the decision maker
(DM) must currently concern themselves with inference for the parameter value
minimising the KL-divergence between the model and the process (Walker, 2013).
However, it has long been known that minimising the KL-divergence places a
large weight on correctly capturing the tails of the sample distribution. As a
result the DM is required to worry about the robustness of their model to tail
misspecifications if they want to conduct principled inference. In this paper
we alleviate these concerns for the DM. We advance recent methodological
developments in general Bayesian updating (Bissiri, Holmes and Walker, 2016) to
propose a statistically well principled Bayesian updating of beliefs targeting
the minimisation of more general divergence criteria. We improve both the
motivation and the statistical foundations of existing Bayesian minimum
divergence estimation (Hooker and Vidyashankar, 2014; Ghosh and Basu, 2016),
allowing the well principled Bayesian to target predictions from the model that
are close to the genuine model in terms of some alternative divergence measure
to the KL-divergence. Our principled formulation allows us to consider a
broader range of divergences than have previously been considered. In fact we
argue defining the divergence measure forms an important, subjective part of
any statistical analysis, and aim to provide some decision theoretic rational
for this selection. We illustrate how targeting alternative divergence measures
can impact the conclusions of simple inference tasks, and discuss then how our
methods might apply to more complicated, high dimensional models.

to the graphene high mechanical flexibility and the possibility of interesting
changes in transport properties. Properly designed strained systems have been
proposed to allow optimized transport responses that can be explored in
experimental realizations. In multi-terminal systems, comparisons between
schemes with different geometries are important to characterize the
modifications introduced by mechanical deformations, specially if the
deformations are localized at a central part of the system or extended in a
large region. Then, in the present analysis, we study the strain effects on the
transport properties of triangular and hexagonal graphene flakes, with zigzag
and armchair edges, connected to three electronic terminals, formed by
semi-infinite graphene nanoribbons. Using the Green's function formalism with
circular renormalization schemes, and a single band tight-binding
approximation, we find that resonant tunneling transport becomes relevant and
is more affected by localized deformations in the hexagonal graphene flakes.
Moreover, triangular systems with deformation extended to the leads, like

of fluid dynamics problems. They allow the calculation of exact flows, are the
basis of the boundary integral methods used in numerical computations, and can
be exploited to derive asymptotic flows in a wide range of physical problems.
The most fundamental singular solution is the flow's Green function due to a
point force, termed the Stokeslet. Its expression is classical both in free
space and near a flat surface. Motivated by problems in biological physics
occurring near corners, we derive in this paper the asymptotic behaviour for
the Stokeslet both near and far from a corner geometry by using complex
analysis on a known double integral solution for corner flows. We investigate
all possible orientations of the point force relative to the corner and all
corner geometries from acute to obtuse. The case of salient corners is also
addressed for point forces aligned with both walls. We use experiments on beads
sedimenting in corn syrup to qualitatively test the applicability of our
results. The final results and scaling laws will allow to address the role of
hydrodynamic interactions in problems from colloidal science to microfluidics

A coefficient-freezing predictor-corrector method is used for nonlinear

results for a selection of examples of multi-material non-equilibrium radiation

provide the convergence guarantees of VR-SGD for this case, and empirically
verify that VR-SGD with varying learning rates achieves similar performance to
its momentum accelerated variant that has the optimal convergence rate
$\mathcal{O}(1/T^2)$. Finally, we apply VR-SGD to solve various machine

noncommutative space. Starting from the noncommutative extended relativistic
equation of motion, the non-relativistic approximation is obtained by using the
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, and then the charged and spin currents are
derived by using the extended Drude model. We find that the charged current is
twisted by modifying the off-diagonal elements of the Hall conductivity,
however, the spin current is not affected up to leading order of the
noncommutative parameter.

  matrix",,,,,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel recursive algorithm for reducing a symmetric matrix to a
triangular factorization which reveals the rank profile matrix. That is, the
algorithm computes a factorization $\mathbf{P}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{P} =
\mathbf{L}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{L}^T$ where $\mathbf{P}$ is a permutation matrix,
$\mathbf{L}$ is lower triangular with a unit diagonal and $\mathbf{D}$ is
symmetric block diagonal with $1{\times}1$ and $2{\times}2$ antidiagonal
blocks. The novel algorithm requires $O(n^2r^{\omega-2})$ arithmetic
operations. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm
can even be slightly more than twice as fast as the state of the art
unsymmetric Gaussian elimination in most cases, that is it achieves
approximately the same computational speed. By adapting the pivoting strategy
developed in the unsymmetric case, we show how to recover the rank profile
matrix from the permutation matrix and the support of the block-diagonal
matrix. There is an obstruction in characteristic $2$ for revealing the rank
profile matrix which requires to relax the shape of the block diagonal by
allowing the 2-dimensional blocks to have a non-zero bottom-right coefficient.
This relaxed decomposition can then be transformed into a standard
$\mathbf{P}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{L}^T\mathbf{P}^T$ decomposition at a
negligible cost.

convolutional layers with a Batch Normalization associated with a Scale Layer,
as well as the use of a sufficiently sized fully connected section. An
augmented database has also been used to improve the training of the CNN.

pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, more complicated vehicle trajectories in
the absence of lane markings, phases that prevent determining who has the right
of way, invisible vehicle approaches, vehicle obstructions, and illegal
movements. These challenges are not fully addressed by the ""road diet"" and road
redesign prescribed in Vision Zero plans, nor will they be completely overcome
by autonomous vehicles with their many sensors and tireless attention to
surroundings. Accidents can also occur because drivers, cyclists and
pedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In
these cases, the missing information can be computed and broadcast by an
intelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase,
an estimate of the time when the phase will change, and the occupancy of the
blind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of
the intelligent intersection, motivated by the analysis of an accident at an
intersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda
CRV and culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection
infrastructure. The intelligent intersection also serves as a software-enabled
version of the `protected intersection' design to improve the passage of
cyclists and pedestrians through an intersection.

interest for analyzing the electrical consumption of commercial buildings.
Whilst having similarities with the Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) tasks
for residential buildings, the nature of the signals that are collected from
large commercial buildings introduces additional difficulties to the NILM
research causing existing NILM approaches to fail. On the other hand, the
amount of publicly available datasets collected from commercial buildings is
very limited, which makes the NILM research even more challenging for this type
of large buildings. In this study, we aim at addressing these issues. We first
present an extensive statistical analysis of both commercial and residential
measurements from public and private datasets and show important differences.
Secondly, we develop an algorithm for generating synthetic current waveforms.
We then demonstrate using real measurement and quantitative metrics that both
our device model and our simulations are realistic and can be used to evaluate
NILM algorithms. Finally, to encourage research on commercial buildings we
release a synthesized dataset.

Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) using the Murchison Widefield
Array (MWA), which was directed toward a Galactic Center field, we report a
second survey toward a Galactic Anticenter field. Using the MWA in the
frequency range of 99 to 122 MHz over a three hour period, a 625 sq. deg. field
centered on Orion KL (in the general direction of the Galactic Anticenter) was
observed with a frequency resolution of 10 kHz. Within this field, 22
exoplanets are known. At the positions of these exoplanets, we searched for
narrow band signals consistent with radio transmissions from intelligent
civilisations. No such signals were found with a 5-sigma detection threshold.
Our sample is significantly different to the 45 exoplanets previously studied
with the MWA toward the Galactic Center Tingay et al.(2016), since the Galactic
Center sample is dominated by exoplanets detected using microlensing, hence at
much larger distances compared to the exoplants toward the Anticenter, found
via radial velocity and transit detection methods. Our average effective
sensitivity to extraterrestrial transmiter power is therefore much improved for
the Anticenter sample. Added to this, our data processing techniques have
improved, reducing our observational errors, leading to our best detection
limit being reduced by approximately a factor of four compared to our
previously published results.

we consider a colloidal fluid with spherically-symmetric competing

includes complex three-dimensional periodically ordered cluster phases such as
lamellae, two-dimensional hexagonally packed cylinders, gyroid structures or
spherical micelles. While the bulk phase behavior has been studied extensively
in earlier work, in this paper we focus on such structures confined between
planar repulsive walls under shear flow. For sufficiently high shear rates, we
observe that microphase separation can become fully suppressed. For lower shear
rates, however, we find that e.g. the gyroid structure undergoes a kinetic
phase transition to a hexagonally packed cylindrical phase, which is found
experimentally and theoretically in amphiphilic block copolymer systems. As
such, besides the known similarities between the latter and colloidal systems
regarding the equilibrium phase behavior, our work reveals further intriguing
non-equilibrium relations between copolymer melts and colloidal fluids with
competing interactions.

  Derivation, Simulation and Experimental Validation",,,,,"physics.ins-det physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To calculate the radioactivity of product nuclides generated in pulse
irradiation, it is generally assumed that the irradiation is approximately
continues in the entire irradiation period ($t_i$) and the flux of incoming
irradiation particle can be obtained by averaging their intensity in each pulse
period ($T$). However, this approximation fails to acknowledge the fact that
the product nuclides are not created in each pulse period ($T$) evenly: they
are only produced in a very short pulse width ($t_p$) and then decay in a
relative long rest time ($t_r=T-t_p$). Given by the enormous number of pulses,
the sum of these decays may not be negligible. To make the activity calculation
in accordance with the real situation in pulse irradiation, we scrutinize the
details of irradiation and decay processes in each pulse, applies the geometric
series to obtain the activity superimposition of millions of pulses, and
derives a novel activity equation particularly suitable for pulse irradiation.
The experimental results, numerical simulations, and activity measurements from
photon activation driven by a pulsed electron LINAC have confirmed the validity
of this new equation. The comparison between the new and traditional equations
indicates that their discrepancy could be significant under certain conditions.
The limitations of the new activity equation for pulse irradiation are
discussed as well.
