the path integral the baryon contributions can be fully separated from quark
and diquark contributions. The baryonic degrees of freedom are independent of
the gauge field and the corresponding free fermion action describes the baryons
through the joint propagation of three quarks. The non-baryonic dynamics is
described by quark and diquark terms that couple to the gauge field. When
evaluating the quark and diquark contributions in the strong coupling limit the
partition function completely factorizes into baryon bags and a complementary
domain. Baryon bags are regions in space-time where the dynamics is described
by a single free fermion made out of three quarks propagating coherently as a
baryon. Outside the baryon bags the relevant degrees of freedom are monomers
and dimers for quarks and diquarks. The partition sum is a sum over all baryon
bag configurations and for each bag a free fermion determinant appears as a
weight factor.

the superconductor. Here we focus on 2+1 dimensional spin-less $p$-wave
superconductors and show that emergent gravity serves as a natural bulk probe

attractive interaction between fermions that leads to superconductivity, and is
therefore built into topological superconductors. The bulk response of a
topological superconductor to the emergent gravitational field is encoded in a
gravitational Chern-Simons term, and is related to the existence of robust
boundary modes via energy-momentum conservation, or gravitational anomaly
inflow. The gravitational Chern-Simons term implies a universal relation
between variations in the superconducting order parameter and the
energy-momentum currents and densities that they induce. The spontaneous
breaking of $U(1)$ symmetry in the superconductor leads to additional bulk
responses, encoded in a gravitational pseudo Chern-Simons term. Although not of

(based on residual learning) achieved a test classification accuracy of 97.50%

the SAC of perennial plant communities from 233 dryland ecosystems from six
continents by comparing the fit of major functions (power-law, logarithmic and
Michaelis-Menten). We tested the theoretical prediction that the effects of
aridity and soil pH on SAC are mediated by vegetation attributes such as
evenness, cover, and spatial aggregation. We found that the logarithmic
relationship was the most common functional form, followed by Michaelis-Menten
and power-law. Functional form was mainly determined by evenness while the SAC
parameters (intercept and slope) were largely determined by spatial
aggregation. In addition, aridity decreased small scale richness (intercept of
SAC) but did not affect accumulation rate (slope of the SAC). Our results
highlight the role that attributes such as spatial aggregation and evenness

As a first application, we demonstrate that any coherent group action

through-plane resolution~(slice thickness) than in-plane resolution. In these
MRI images, high frequency information in the through-plane direction is not
acquired, and cannot be resolved through interpolation. To address this issue,
super-resolution methods have been developed to enhance spatial resolution. As
an ill-posed problem, state-of-the-art super-resolution methods rely on the
presence of external/training atlases to learn the transform from low
resolution~(LR) images to high resolution~(HR) images. For several reasons,
such HR atlas images are often not available for MRI sequences. This paper
presents a self super-resolution~(SSR) algorithm, which does not use any
external atlas images, yet can still resolve HR images only reliant on the

vacuum expectation value after the electroweak phase transition and may decay

find that through highly polarizable dipolar phonons, large cavity-enhanced
electron-phonon couplings are possible but superconductivity is not enhanced
for the forward-scattering pairing mechanism due to the interplay between
coupling enhancement and mode softening. An analysis of critical temperature

be difficult with the same uncertainties. Our uninformative prior was

can only be explained by self-gravity if the disc has a low opacity (and
therefore efficient cooling), and is minimally supported by external

beyond the virial radius of their dark matter halos. Previous observations in
X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal claimed that $\sim(1-50)\%$ of the

scatter is mainly caused by the very uncertain extrapolation of the hot gas
density profile based on the detection in a small radial range (typically
within 10\%-20\% of the virial radius). Here we report stacking X-ray
observations of six local isolated massive spiral galaxies from the CGM-MASS
sample. We find that the mean density profile can be characterized by a single
power law out to a galactocentric radius of $\approx 200\rm~kpc$ (or
$\approx130\rm~kpc$ above the 1~$\sigma$ background uncertainty), about half
the virial radius of the dark matter halo. We can now estimate that the hot CGM
within the virial radius accounts for $(8\pm4)\%$ of the baryonic mass expected
for the halos. Including the stars, the baryon fraction is $(27\pm16)\%$, or
$(39\pm20)\%$ by assuming a flattened density profile at $r\gtrsim130\rm~kpc$.

in a full Eulerian-AMR cosmological simulation. A novel numerical procedure is
applied on the outputs of the simulation, which are post-processed with a
full-radiative transfer code that allows to compute the change of the intensity
at any frequency along the null-geodesic of photons. We compare the emission
from the whole inter-galactic medium (IGM) and from the WHIM component (defined
as the gas with a temperature in the range $10^5-10^7$ K) at three
observational bands associated to thermal X-rays, thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and radio emission. The synthetic maps produced by
this procedure could be directly compared with existing observational maps and
could be used as a guide for future observations with forthcoming instruments.
The analysis of the different emissions associated to a high-resolution galaxy
cluster is in broad agreement with previous simulated and observational
estimates of both gas components.

been produced using the abundance stratification technique. These two objects

1404, which allows for a direct comparison. SN 2007on synthesised 0.25
$M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni and was less luminous than SN 2011iv, which produced
0.31 $M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni. SN 2007on had a lower central density
($\rho_{c}$) and higher explosion energy ($E_{\rm kin}$ $\sim
1.3\pm$0.3$\times10^{51}$erg) than SN 2011iv, and it produced less nuclear
statistical equilibrium (NSE) elements (0.06 $M_{\odot}$). Whereas, SN 2011iv
had a larger $\rho_{c}$, which increased the electron capture rate in the
lowest velocity regions, and produced 0.35 $M_{\odot}$ of stable NSE elements.
SN 2011iv had an explosion energy of $E_{\rm kin}$ $\sim 0.9

Chandrasekhar mass (Ch-mass), and their observational properties are well
described by predictions from delayed-detonation explosion models. Within this
framework, comparison to the sub-luminous SN 1986G indicates SN 2011iv and SN
1986G have different transition densities ($\rho_{tr}$) but similar $\rho_{c}$.
Whereas, SN 1986G and SN 2007on had a similar $\rho_{tr}$ but different
$\rho_{c}$. Finally, we examine the colour-stretch parameter $s_{BV}$ vs.

need for consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Conflict-free
replicated data types (CRDTs) are widely used in eventually consistent systems
to reduce concurrency control. However, due to the lack of consistent
non-monotonic operations, the usage of CRDTs can be difficult. In this paper,
we propose a new consistency protocol, the observable atomic consistency
protocol (OACP). OACP enables a principled relax- ation of strong consistency
to improve performance in specific scenarios. OACP combines the advantages of
mergeable data types, specifically, convergent replicated data types, and
reliable total order broadcast to provide on-demand strong consistency. By
providing observable atomic consistency, OACP avoids the anomalies of related
protocols. We provide a distributed, cluster-enabled implementation of OACP
based on Akka, a widely-used actor-based middleware. Our experimental
evaluation shows that OACP can reduce the coordination between replicas
compared to other protocols providing atomic consistency in several bench-
marks. Our results also suggest that OACP gains availability through mergeable
data types and provides acceptable latency for achieving strong consistency.

explore the ultimate limit of the far-field violation of Planck's law, here we
present a theoretical study of the radiative heat transfer between
two-dimensional (2D) materials. We show that the far-field thermal radiation
exchanged by two coplanar systems with a one-atom-thick geometrical cross
section can be more than 7 orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical
limit set by Planck's law for blackbodies and can be comparable to the heat
transfer of two parallel sheets at the same distance. In particular, we
illustrate this phenomenon with different materials such as graphene, where the
radiation can also be tuned by a external gate, and single-layer black
phosphorus. In both cases the far-field radiative heat transfer is dominated by
TE-polarized guiding modes and surface plasmons play no role. Our predictions
provide a new insight into the thermal radiation exchange mechanisms between 2D

species of quasiparticles, such as electrons and phonons. Strong interactions
between quasiparticles, however, can lead to collective behaviour, including
the possibility of viscous hydrodynamic flow. In the case of electrons and
phonons, an electron-phonon fluid is expected to exhibit strong phonon-drag
transport signatures and an anomalously low thermal conductivity. The Dirac
semi-metal PtSn4 has a very low resistivity at low temperatures and shows a
pronounced phonon drag peak in the low temperature thermopower; it is therefore
an excellent candidate for hosting a hydrodynamic electron-phonon fluid. Here
we report measurements of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the
longitudinal and Hall electrical resistivities, the thermopower and the thermal
conductivity of PtSn4. We confirm a phonon drag peak in the thermopower near 14
K and observe a concurrent breakdown of the Lorenz ratio below the Sommerfeld
value. Both of these facts are expected for an electron-phonon fluid with a
quasi-conserved total momentum. A hierarchy between momentum-conserving and
momentum-relaxing scattering timescales is corroborated through measurements of
the magnetic field dependence of the electrical and Hall resistivity and of the
thermal conductivity. These results show that PtSn4 exhibits key features of

one red-shifted and one blue shifted. These components are similar in mass but
have slightly different degrees of ionization. They recede from one another at
a line-of-sight speed larger than the sum of the combined expansion velocities
of their emitting cores, thereby acting as two independent nebulae. While this
configuration appears to be consistent with the scenario of two white dwarfs
colliding, it may also indicate an off-centre delayed detonation explosion of a
near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. In either case, broad emission line widths
and a rapidly evolving light curve can be expected for the bolometric
luminosity of the SN. This is the case for both SNe 2007on and 2011iv, also a
transitional SN Ia which exploded in the same elliptical galaxy, NGC 1404.
Although SN 2011iv does not show double-peaked emission line profiles, the
width of its emission lines is such that a two-component model yields somewhat
better results than a single-component model. Most of the mass ejected is in
one component, however, which suggests that SN 2011iv was the result of the

indicates that the presence of magnetic fields and radial viscous force cannot
give rise to any new mode of the instability. We find, however, that growth
rate of the thermal mode in the slim discs and that of the acoustic modes in
the slim and optically thin discs are dramatically affected by the radial
viscous force. This force tends to strongly decrease the growth rate of the
outward-propagating acoustic mode (O-mode) at the short-wavelength limit, but
it causes a slim disc to become thermally more unstable. We find that growth
rate of the thermal mode increases in the presence of radial viscous force.
This enhancement is more significant when the viscosity parameter is large. We
also show that growth rate of the O-mode reduces when radial viscous force is
considered. The growth rates of the thermal and acoustic modes depend on the
magnetic field. Although the instability of O-mode for a stronger magnetic
field case has a higher growth rate, the thermal mode of the slim discs can be
suppressed when the magnetic field is strong. The inertial-acoustic instability

passively evolving galaxy populations to calculate the Hubble parameter H(z).
The age estimator emerges from the relationship between the amplitude of the
rest frame Balmer break at 4000 angstroms and the age of a galaxy, assuming
that there is one single stellar population within each galaxy. However, recent
literature has shown possible contamination (up to 2.4% of the stellar mass in
a high redshift sample) of a young component embedded within the predominantly
old population of the quiescent galaxy.
  We compared the data with the predictions of each model, using a new approach
of distinguishing between systematic and statistical errors (in previous works,
these had incorrectly been added in quadrature) and evaluating the effects of
contamination by a young stellar component. The ages inferred using cosmic
chronometers represent a galaxy-wide average rather than a characteristic of
the oldest population alone. The average contribution from the young component
to the rest luminosity at 4000 angstroms may constitute a third of the
luminosity in some samples, which means that this is far from negligible. This
ratio is significantly dependent on stellar mass, proportional to M^{-0.7}.
Consequently, the measurements of the absolute value of the age or the
differential age between different redshifts are incorrect and make the
previous calculations of H(z) very inaccurate. Some cosmological models, such
as the Einstein-de Sitter model or quasi-steady state cosmology, which are
rejected under the assumption of a purely old population, can be made
compatible with the predicted ages of the Universe as a function of redshift if
we take this contamination into account. However, the static Universe models
are rejected by these H(z) measurements, even when this contamination is taken
into account.

requirements. This data-driven ANN framework allows for a nonlinear time
evolution of the modal coefficients without performing a Galerkin projection.
Our POD-ANN framework can thus be considered an equation-free approach for
latent space dynamics evolution of nonlinear transient systems and can be
applied to a wide range of physical and engineering applications. Within this
framework we introduce two architectures, namely sequential network (SN) and
residual network (RN), to train the trajectory of modal coefficients. We
perform a systematic analysis of the performance of the proposed reduced order

governed by the viscous Burgers equation, a simplified prototype setting for
transient flows. We find that the POD-ANN-RN yields stable and accurate results

temperature gradient, with the southwestern part of the gas cooler than the
rest by up to 2 keV. Pressure estimates suggest that the gas is a coherent
structure of single origin located inside the cocoon, with a mass of roughly
$2\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We conclude that the gas is debris resulting from
disintegration of the cool core of the Cygnus A cluster after the passage of
the jet during the early stages of the current epoch of activity. The 4 keV gas
now lies on the central inside surface of the hotter cocoon rim. The
temperature gradient could result from an offset between the centre of the

  properly",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes our experiences creating Tornado: a practical and
efficient heterogeneous programming framework for managed languages. The novel
aspect of Tornado is that it turns the programming of heterogeneous systems
from an activity predominantly based on a priori knowledge into one based on a
posteriori knowledge. Alternatively put, it simply means developers do not need
to overcomplicate their code by catering for all possible eventualities.
Instead, Tornado provides the ability to specialize each application for a
specific system in situ which avoids the need for it to be pre-configured by
the developer. To enable this, Tornado employs a sophisticated runtime system
that can dynamically configure all aspects of the application - from selecting
which parallelization scheme to apply to specifying which accelerators to use.
By using this ability, the end-user, and not the developer, can transparently
make use of any available multi-/many-core processor or hardware accelerator.
  To showcase the impact of Tornado, we implement a real-world computer vision
application and deploy it across nine accelerators without having to modify the
source code or even explicitly re-compile the application. Using dynamic
configuration, we show that our implementation can achieve up to 124 frames per
second (FPS) - up to 166x speedup over the reference implementation. Finally,
our implementation is always within 21% of a hand-written OpenCL version but
avoids much of the programming tedium.

relativistic Lie algebras: de Sitter, Anti-de Sitter and Poincar\'e, which
describe the symmetries of the three maximally symmetric spacetimes. These
algebras represent the centrepiece of the kinematics of special relativity (and
its analogue in (Anti-)de Sitter spacetime), and provide the simplest framework
to build physical models in which inertial observers are equivalent. Such a
property can be expected to be preserved by Quantum Gravity, a theory which
should build a length/energy scale into the microscopic structure of spacetime.
Quantum groups, and their infinitesimal version `Lie bialgebras', allow to
encode such a scale into a noncommutativity of the algebra of functions over
the group (and over spacetime, when the group acts on a homogeneous space). In
2+1 dimensions we have evidence that the vacuum state of Quantum Gravity is one
such `noncommutative spacetime' whose symmetries are described by a Lie
bialgebra. It is then of great interest to study the possible Lie bialgebra
deformations of the relativistic Lie algebras. In this paper, we develop a
classification of such deformations in 2, 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions, based
on physical requirements based on dimensional analysis, on various degrees of
`manifest isotropy' (which implies that certain symmetries, i.e. Lorentz
transformations or rotations, are `more classical'), and on discrete symmetries
like P and T. On top of a series of new results in 3 and 4 dimensions, we find
a no-go theorem for the Lie bialgebras in 4 dimensions, which singles out the
well-known `$\kappa$-deformation' as the only one that depends on the first
power of the Planck length, or, alternatively, that possesses `manifest'
spatial isotropy.

that some of these factors correspond to aspects of the environment which are

yield changes in that feature with minimal changes to other features that

inverse cube of the interparticle distance, belongs to the class of very soft
long-ranged interactions. As a result, the investigated system exhibits certain
universal properties that are also shared by other related soft-interacting

construct a simple and reliable description of the system thermodynamics. In
particular, Helmholtz free energies of the fluid and solid phases are derived,
from which the location of the fluid-solid coexistence is determined. The
quasi-crystalline approximation is applied to the description of collective
modes in dipole fluids. Its simplification, previously validated on strongly
coupled plasma fluids, is used to derive explicit analytic dispersion relations
for the longitudinal and transverse wave modes, which compare satisfactory with
those obtained from direct MD simulations in the long-wavelength regime. Sound
velocities of the dipole fluids and solids are derived and analyzed.

main body of the galaxy. The integrated star formation rate of NGC7252 (i.e.,
that in the galaxy and tidal tails combined) without correcting for extinction
is found to be 0.81 $\pm$ 0.01 M$_{\odot}$/yr. We show that the integrated star
formation rate can change by an order of magnitude if the extinction correction
used in star formation rates derived from other proxies are taken into
consideration. The star formation rates in the associated tidal dwarf galaxies
(NGC7252E, SFR=0.02 M$_{\odot}$/yr and NGC7252NW, SFR=0.03 M$_{\odot}$/yr) are
typical of dwarf galaxies in the local Universe. The spatial resolution of the

the triggering of star formation in the gas reservoir that was expelled during

stellar discs and an unusually large HI disc. We comment on the implications of
this disc for the formation of $2\sigma$ galaxies. In general, the HI detection
rate, the incidence of relaxed HI discs, and the HI/stellar mass ratios of slow
rotators are indistinguishable from those of fast rotators. These broad
similarities suggest that the HI we are detecting now is unrelated to the
galaxies' formation processes and was often acquired after their stars were
mostly in place. We also discuss the HI nondetections; some of these galaxies
that are undetected in HI or CO are detected in other tracers (e.g. FIR fine
structure lines and dust). The question of whether there is cold gas in massive
galaxies' scoured nuclear cores still needs work. Finally, we discuss an
unusual isolated HI cloud with a surprisingly faint (undetected) optical
counterpart.

one-loop box diagram. The split in the masses of the scalars in the doublet

Supernovae (SN Ia) has assumed that these explosions were due to the transfer

maximum for a stable degenerate system, fusion can be initiated and the star
explodes. However, there are now a number of indications that fusion could
instead be triggered by a phase transition in a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf

transition initiates the explosion, it is possible that remarkable and well
established host galaxy effects as considered in the present work could point
to a specific source of the energy deposition. These host galaxy correlations
are, at first glance, surprising since the typical distance scale of white

Specifically, we propose a variant of the Best Arm Identification problem for
\emph{contaminated bandits}, where each arm pull has probability $\varepsilon$
of generating a sample from an arbitrary contamination distribution instead of
the true underlying distribution. The goal is to identify the best (or
approximately best) true distribution with high probability, with a secondary
goal of providing guarantees on the quality of this distribution. The primary
challenge of the contaminated bandit setting is that the true distributions are
only partially identifiable, even with infinite samples. To address this, we
develop tight, non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds for high-probability
estimation of the first two robust moments (median and median absolute
deviation) from contaminated samples. These concentration inequalities are the
main technical contributions of the paper and may be of independent interest.
Using these results, we adapt several classical Best Arm Identification
algorithms to the contaminated bandit setting and derive sample complexity
upper bounds for our problem. Finally, we provide matching
information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity (up to a small
logarithmic factor).

  Approach",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1999, Brodal and Fagerberg (BF) gave an algorithm for maintaining a low
outdegree orientation of a dynamic uniformly sparse graph. Specifically, for a
dynamic graph on $n$-vertices, with arboricity bounded by $\alpha$ at all
times, the BF algorithm supports edge updates in $O(\log n)$ amortized update
time, while keeping the maximum outdegree in the graph bounded by $O(\alpha)$.
Such an orientation provides a basic data structure for uniformly sparse
graphs, which found applications to a plethora of dynamic graph algorithms.
  A significant weakness of the BF algorithm is the possible \emph{temporary}
blowup of the maximum outdegree, following edge insertions. Although BF
eventually reduces all outdegrees to $O(\alpha)$, local memory usage at the
vertices, which is an important quality measure in distributed systems, cannot
be bounded. We show how to modify the BF algorithm to guarantee that the
outdegrees of all vertices are bounded by $O(\alpha)$ at all times, without
hurting any of its other properties, and present an efficient distributed
implementation of the modified algorithm. This provides the \emph{first}
representation of distributed networks in which the local memory usage at all
vertices is bounded by the arboricity (which is essentially the average degree
of the densest subgraph) rather than the maximum degree.
  For settings where there are no local memory constraints, we take the
temporary outdegree blowup to the extreme and allow a permanent outdegree
blowup. This allows us to address the second significant weakness of the BF
algorithm -- its inherently \emph{global} nature: An insertion of an edge
$(u,v)$ may trigger changes in the orientations of edges that are far away from
$u$ and $v$. We suggest an alternative \emph{local} scheme, which does not
guarantee any outdegree bound on the vertices, yet is just as efficient as the
BF scheme for various applications.

existence in large quantum systems is difficult to confirm experimentally. This
is mostly due to the inadequacy of standard multipartite Bell inequalities to
many-body systems: such inequalities usually rely on expectation values
involving many parties and require an individual addressing of each party. In a
recent work [J. Tura et al. Science 344, 6189 (2014)] some of us proposed
simpler Bell inequalities overcoming such difficulties, opening the way for the
detection of Bell correlations with trusted collective measurements through
Bell correlation witnesses [R. Schmied et al. Science 352, 441 (2016)], hence
demonstrating the presence of Bell correlations with assumptions on the
statistics. Here, we address the question of assessing the number of particles
sharing genuinely nonlocal correlations in a multipartite system. This
endeavour is a priori challenging, as known Bell inequalities for genuine
nonlocality suffer from the above shortcomings, plus a number of measurement
settings scaling exponentially with the system size. We first show that most of
these constraints drop once the witnesses corresponding to these inequalities
are expressed: in systems where multipartite expectation values can be
evaluated, these witnesses can reveal genuine nonlocality for an arbitrary
number of particles with just two collective measurements. We then introduce a
general framework focused on two-body Bell-like inequalities. We show that they
also provide information about the number of particles that are genuinely
nonlocal. Then, we characterize all such inequalities for a finite system size.
We provide witnesses of Bell correlation depth $k\leq6$ for any number of
parties, within experimental reach. A violation for depth $6$ is achieved with
existing data from an ensemble of 480 atoms.

increases with increasing Fermi momentum, and is in agreement with previous
studies in the limit of high chemical potential. If a quadratic term is
present, the pairing is instead of BCS type above a certain chemical potential.
In the antiferromagnetic case, BCS pairing occurs when the ferromagnetic

localization, an association with a dwarf galaxy, and the identification of a
coincident persistent radio source. However, further localizations are required
to determine the nature of FRBs, the sources powering them, and the possibility
of multiple populations. Here we investigate the use of associated persistent
radio sources to establish FRB counterparts, taking into account the
localization area and the persistent source flux density. Due to the lower
areal number density of radio sources compared to faint optical sources, robust
associations can be achieved for less precise localizations as compared to
direct optical host galaxy associations. For generally larger localizations
which preclude robust associations, the number of candidate hosts can be
reduced based on the ratio of radio-to-optical brightness. We find that
confident associations with $\sim 0.01-$1 mJy sources, comparable to the
luminosity of the persistent source associated with FRB 121102 over the
redshift range $z \approx 0.1 - 1$, require FRB localizations of $\lesssim
20''$. In the absence of a robust association, constraints can be placed on the
luminosity of an associated radio source as a function of localization and DM.
For DM $\approx 1000 \rm \ pc \ cm^{-3}$, an upper limit comparable to the
luminosity of the FRB 121102 persistent source can be placed if the
localization is $\lesssim 10''$. We apply our analysis to the case of the ASKAP

identify two candidate hosts based on a ratio of radio-to-optical brightness of

modeling the observed multiplicities of the transiting planets (tranets) and
their transit timing variations (TTVs). We robustly determine that the fraction
of Sun-like stars with Kepler-like planets, $\eta_{\rm Kepler}$, is $30\pm3\%$.
Here Kepler-like planets are planets that have radii $R_{\rm p} \gtrsim
R_\oplus$ and orbital periods $P<400$~days. Our result thus significantly
revises previous claims that more than 50\% of Sun-like stars have such
planets. Combining with the average number of Kepler planets per star
($\sim0.9$), we obtain that on average each planetary system has $3.0\pm0.3$
planets within 400 days. We also find that the dispersion in orbital
inclinations of planets within a given planetary system, $\sigma_{i,k}$, is a
steep function of its number of planets, $k$. This can be parameterized as
$\sigma_{i,k}\propto k^\alpha$ and we find that $-4<\alpha<-2$ at 2-$\sigma$
level. Such a distribution well describes the observed multiplicities of both
tranets and TTVs with no excess of single tranets. Therefore we do not find
evidence supporting the so-called ""Kepler dichotomy."" Together with a previous
study on orbital eccentricities, we now have a consistent picture: the fewer
planets in a system, the hotter it is dynamically. We discuss briefly possible
scenarios that lead to such a trend. Despite our Solar system not belonging to
the Kepler club, it is interesting to notice that the Solar system also has
three planets within 400 days and that the inclination dispersion is similar to
Kepler systems of the same multiplicity.

embedded two-level systems maintained at a strong inversion of population. As
specific applications of these methods, we discuss the generation of Mott

step, we present the case of a narrowband emission spectrum and show how this
allows for the stabilization of MI and FQH states under the condition that the
photonic states are relatively flat in energy. As soon as the photonic
bandbwidth becomes comparable to the emission linewidth, important
non-equilibrium signatures and entropy generation appear. As a second step, we
review a more advanced configuration based on reservoirs with a broadband
frequency distribution, and we highlight the potential of this configuration
for the quantum simulation of equilibrium quantum phases at zero temperature
with tunable chemical potential. As a proof of principle we establish the
applicability of our scheme to the Bose-Hubbard model by confirming the
presence of a perfect agreement with the ground-state predictions both in the
Mott Insulating and superfluid regions, and more generally in all parts of the
parameter space. Future prospects towards the quantum simulation of more
complex configurations are finally outlined, along with a discussion of our

fell into the Galaxy, it is interesting to explore just how and when this dwarf
lost its gas. To date, there has been no definitive detection of an associated

observe the universe around us, where measurements could enable several niche
astrophysical science cases that are too difficult to perform near Earth.
NASA's New Horizons mission comprises an instrument package that provides
imaging capability from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (near-IR) wavelengths
with moderate spectral resolution located beyond the orbit of Pluto. A
carefully designed survey with New Horizons can optimize the use of expendable
propellant and the limited data telemetry bandwidth to allow several
measurements, including a detailed understanding of the cosmic extragalactic
background light; studies of the local and extragalactic UV background;
measurements of the properties of dust and ice in the outer solar system;
confirmation and characterization of transiting exoplanets; determinations of
the mass of dark objects using gravitational microlensing; and rapid follow-up
of transient events. New Horizons is currently in an extended mission designed
to focus on Kuiper Belt science that will conclude in 2021. The astrophysics
community has a unique, generational opportunity to use this mission for
astronomical observation at heliocentric distances beyond 50 au in the next
decade. In this paper, we discuss the potential science cases for such an
extended mission, and provide an initial assessment of the most important
operational requirements and observation strategies it would require. We
conclude that New Horizons is capable of transformative science, and that it
would make a valuable and unique asset for astrophysical science that is
unlikely to be replicated in the near future.

  Crater II","submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sty1278",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group obey a relationship between the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion and half-light radius, although there are a
number of dwarfs that lie beneath this relation with suppressed velocity
dispersion. The most discrepant of these (in the Milky Way) is the `feeble
giant' Crater II. Using analytic arguments supported by controlled numerical
simulations of tidally-stripped flattened two-component dwarf galaxies, we
investigate interpretations of Crater II within standard galaxy formation
theory. Heavy tidal disruption is necessary to explain the velocity-dispersion
suppression which is plausible if the proper motion of Crater II is
$(\mu_{\alpha*},\mu_\delta)=(-0.21\pm0.09,-0.24\pm0.09)\mathrm{mas\,yr}^{-1}$.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the velocity dispersion of tidally-disrupted
systems is solely a function of the total mass loss even for weakly-embedded
and flattened systems. The half-light radius evolution depends more sensitively
on orbital phase and the properties of the dark matter profile. The half-light
radius of weakly-embedded cusped systems rapidly decreases producing some
tension with the Crater II observations. This tension is alleviated by cored
dark matter profiles, in which the half-light radius can grow after tidal
disruption. The evolution of flattened galaxies is characterised by two
competing effects: tidal shocking makes the central regions rounder whilst
tidal distortion produces a prolate tidally-locked outer envelope. After
$\sim70$ per cent of the central mass is lost, tidal distortion becomes the
dominant effect and the shape of the central regions of the galaxy tends to a
universal prolate shape irrespective of the initial shape.

Dirac fermions interact through an emergent U$(1)$ gauge theory at Chern-Simons

realized at special values of the external magnetic field. Transitions between
particle-hole conjugate Jain states realize ""pure"" QED$_3$ in which multiple
flavors of Dirac fermion interact with a Maxwell U$(1)$ gauge field. The
multi-flavor nature of the critical point leads to an emergent SU$(N_f)$

function ${\cal E}(z)$ of a binary optimization problem and a bit-string $z_i$
with atypically low energy, our goal is to find other bit-strings with energies
within a narrow window around ${\cal E}(z_i)$. We study PT due to quantum
evolution under a transverse field $B_\perp$ of an n-qubit system that encodes
${\cal E}(z)$. We focus on a simple yet nontrivial model: $M$ randomly chosen
""marked"" bit-strings ($2^n \gg M$) are assigned energies in the interval ${\cal
E}(z)\in[-n -W/2, n + W/2]$ with $W << B_\perp$, while the rest of the states
are assigned energy $0$. The PT starts at a marked state $z_i$ and ends up in a
superposition of $\sim \Omega$ marked states inside the PT window. The scaling
of a typical runtime for PT with $n$ and $\Omega$ is the same as in the
multi-target Grover's algorithm, except for a factor that is equal to $\exp(n
\,B_{\perp}^{-2}/2)$ for $n \gg B_{\perp}^{2} \gg 1$. Unlike the Hamiltonians
used in analog quantum search algorithms, the model we consider is
non-integrable, and the transverse field delocalizes the marked states. PT
protocol is not sensitive to the value of B and may be initialized at a marked
state. We develop microscopic theory of PT. Under certain conditions, the band
of the system eigenstates splits into mini-bands of non-ergodic delocalized
states, whose width obeys a heavy-tailed distribution directly related to that
of PT runtimes. We find analytical form of this distribution by solving
nonlinear cavity equations for the random matrix ensemble. We argue that our
approach can be applied to study the PT protocol in other transverse field spin
glass models, with a potential quantum advantage over classical algorithms.

algorithmic decision making. Most prior works on algorithmic fairness
normatively prescribe how fair decisions ought to be made. In contrast, here,
we descriptively survey users for how they perceive and reason about fairness
in algorithmic decision making.
  A key contribution of this work is the framework we propose to understand why
people perceive certain features as fair or unfair to be used in algorithms.
Our framework identifies eight properties of features, such as relevance,
volitionality and reliability, as latent considerations that inform people's
moral judgments about the fairness of feature use in decision-making
algorithms. We validate our framework through a series of scenario-based
surveys with 576 people. We find that, based on a person's assessment of the
eight latent properties of a feature in our exemplar scenario, we can
accurately (> 85%) predict if the person will judge the use of the feature as
fair.
  Our findings have important implications. At a high-level, we show that
people's unfairness concerns are multi-dimensional and argue that future
studies need to address unfairness concerns beyond discrimination. At a
low-level, we find considerable disagreements in people's fairness judgments.
We identify root causes of the disagreements, and note possible pathways to

gravity. Discrete geometries have a finite number of degrees of freedom and can
mimic aspects of quantum geometry. However, selection of the correct discrete
freedoms and description of their dynamics has remained a challenging problem.
We explore classical area Regge calculus, an alternative to standard Regge
calculus where instead of lengths, the areas of a simplicial discretization are
fundamental. There are a number of surprises: though the equations of motion
impose flatness we show that diffeomorphism symmetry is broken for a large
class of area Regge geometries. This is due to degrees of freedom not available
in the length calculus. In particular, an area discretization only imposes that
the areas of glued simplicial faces agrees; their shapes need not be the same.
We enumerate and characterize these non-metric, or `twisted', degrees of
freedom and provide tools for understanding their dynamics. The non-metric
degrees of freedom also lead to fewer invariances of the area Regge action---in
comparison to the length action---under local changes of the triangulation
(Pachner moves). This means that invariance properties can be used to classify
the dynamics of spin foam models. Our results lay a promising foundation for
understanding the dynamics of the non-metric degrees of freedom in loop quantum
gravity and spin foams.

of the pion and kaon are used to calculate their light-front wave functions
(LFWFs), parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs), quasi-PDAs (qPDAs), valence
parton distribution functions (PDFs), and quasi-PDFs (qPDFs). The LFWFs are
broad, concave functions; and the scale of flavour-symmetry violation in the
kaon is roughly 15%, being set by the ratio of emergent masses in the $s$-and
$u$-quark sectors. qPDAs computed with longitudinal momentum $P_z =1.75\,$GeV
provide a semiquantitatively accurate representation of the objective PDA; but
even with $P_z=3\,$GeV, they cannot provide information about this amplitude's
endpoint behaviour. On the valence-quark domain, similar outcomes characterise
qPDFs. In this connection, however, the ratio of kaon-to-pion $u$-quark qPDFs
is found to provide a good approximation to the true PDF ratio on $0.3\lesssim
x \lesssim 0.8$, suggesting that with existing resources computations of ratios
of quasi-parton-distributions can yield results that support empirical
comparison.

system consisting of three transiting small planets whose orbital periods of
1.2, 3.6, and 6.2 days are near the 1:3:5 ratio. GJ 9827 hosts the nearest
planetary system (d = $30.32\pm1.62$ pc) detected by Kepler and K2 . Its
brightness (V = 10.35 mag) makes the star an ideal target for detailed studies
of the properties of its planets.
  Results. We find that GJ 9827 b has a mass of
$M_\mathrm{b}=3.74^{+0.50}_{-0.48}$ $M_\oplus$ and a radius of
$R_\mathrm{b}=1.62^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$ $R_\oplus$, yielding a mean density of
$\rho_\mathrm{b} = 4.81^{+1.97}_{-1.33}$ g cm$^{-3}$. GJ 9827 c has a mass of
$M_\mathrm{c}=1.47^{+0.59}_{-0.58}$ $M_\oplus$, radius of
$R_\mathrm{c}=1.27^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$ $R_\oplus$, and a mean density of
$\rho_\mathrm{c}= 3.87^{+2.38}_{-1.71}$ g cm$^{-3}$. For GJ 9827 d we derive
$M_\mathrm{d}=2.38^{+0.71}_{-0.69}$ $M_\oplus$,
$R_\mathrm{d}=2.09^{+0.22}_{-0.21}$ $R_\oplus$, and $\rho_\mathrm{d}=
1.42^{+0.75}_{-0.52}$ g cm$^{-3}$.
  Conclusions. GJ 9827 is one of the few known transiting planetary systems for
which the masses of all planets have been determined with a precision better
than 30%. This system is particularly interesting because all three planets are
close to the limit between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. We also find that
the planetary bulk compositions are compatible with a scenario where all three
planets formed with similar core/atmosphere compositions, and we speculate that
while GJ 9827 b and GJ 9827 c lost their atmospheric envelopes, GJ 9827 d
maintained its atmosphere, owing to the much lower stellar irradiation. This
makes GJ 9827 one of the very few systems where the dynamical evolution and the
atmospheric escape can be studied in detail for all planets, helping us to
understand how compact systems form and evolve.

two layers of hidden neurons mediate quantum correlations among physical

compact and exact network representations for the ground states are obtained
without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. The number of

both physical and neuron degrees of freedom. We provide specific examples for
the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg models by implementing efficient
sampling. As a compact, classical representation for many-body quantum systems,
our approach is an alternative to the standard path integral, and it is
potentially useful also to systematically improve on numerical approaches based

synthesis modeling of individual quiescent galaxies. The lower limit of our
stellar mass range is $M_*=10^{9.7}M_\odot$, the lowest galaxy mass at which
individual stellar metallicity has been measured beyond the local universe. We
report a detection of an evolution of the stellar MZR with observed redshift at
$0.037\pm0.007$ dex per Gyr, consistent with the predictions from
hydrodynamical simulations. Additionally, we find that the evolution of the
stellar MZR with observed redshift can be explained by an evolution of the
stellar MZR with their formation time, i.e., when the single stellar population
(SSP)-equivalent ages of galaxies are taken into account. This behavior is
consistent with stars forming out of gas that also has an MZR with a
normalization that decreases with redshift. Lastly, we find that over the
observed mass range, the MZR can be described by a linear function with a
shallow slope, ($[Fe/H] \propto (0.16 \pm 0.03) \log M_*$). The slope suggests
that galaxy feedback, in terms of mass-loading factor, might be
mass-independent over the observed mass and redshift range.

would indicate that a few per cent of the Galactic bulge was built up from
destruction and/or evaporation of globular clusters. Here an attempt is made to
identify such presumptive stripped stars originating from the massive, inner
Galaxy globular cluster NGC~6441 using its rich RR Lyrae variable star (RRL)
population. We present radial velocities of forty RRLs centered on the globular
cluster NGC~6441. All of the 13 RRLs observed within the cluster tidal radius
have velocities consistent with cluster membership, with an average radial
velocity of 24 +- 5~km/s and a star-to-star scatter of 11~km/s. This includes
two new RRLs that were previously not associated with the cluster. Eight RRLs
with radial velocities consistent with cluster membership but up to three time
the distance from the tidal radius are also reported. These potential
extra-tidal RRLs also have exceptionally long periods, which is a curious
characteristic of the NGC~6441 RRL population that hosts RRLs with periods
longer than seen anywhere else in the Milky Way. As expected of stripped
cluster stars, most are inline with the cluster's orbit. Therefore, either the
tidal radius of NGC~6441 is underestimated and/or we are seeing dissolving
cluster stars stemming from NGC~6441 that are building up the old spheroidal

being useful for inference on binary responses, these methods serve also as
building blocks in more complex formulations, such as density regression,
nonparametric classification and graphical models. Within the Bayesian
framework, inference proceeds by updating the priors for the coefficients,
typically set to be Gaussians, with the likelihood induced by probit or logit
regressions for the responses. In this updating, the apparent absence of a
tractable posterior has motivated a variety of computational methods, including
Markov Chain Monte Carlo routines and algorithms which approximate the
posterior. Despite being routinely implemented, Markov Chain Monte Carlo
strategies face mixing or time-inefficiency issues in large p and small n
studies, whereas approximate routines fail to capture the skewness typically
observed in the posterior. This article proves that the posterior distribution
for the probit coefficients has a unified skew-normal kernel, under Gaussian
priors. Such a novel result allows efficient Bayesian inference for a wide
class of applications, especially in large p and small-to-moderate n studies
where state-of-the-art computational methods face notable issues. These
advances are outlined in a genetic study, and further motivate the development
of a wider class of conjugate priors for probit models along with methods to

surgical instruments is crucial for delicate minimally invasive temporal bone
surgery. Current techniques lack in accuracy and/or line-of-sight constraints
(conventional tracking systems) or expose the patient to prohibitive ionizing
radiation (intra-operative CT). A possible solution is to capture the
instrument with a c-arm at irregular intervals and recover the pose from the
image.
  Methods: i3PosNet infers the position and orientation of instruments from
images using a pose estimation network. Said framework considers localized
patches and outputs pseudo-landmarks. The pose is reconstructed from
pseudo-landmarks by geometric considerations.
  Results: We show i3PosNet reaches errors less than 0.05mm. It outperforms
conventional image registration-based approaches reducing average and maximum
errors by at least two thirds. i3PosNet trained on synthetic images generalizes
to real x-rays without any further adaptation.
  Conclusion: The translation of Deep Learning based methods to surgical
applications is difficult, because large representative datasets for training
and testing are not available. This work empirically shows sub-millimeter pose
estimation trained solely based on synthetic training data.

dynamics of classical stochastic dimers. At the so-called Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK)
point a quantum dimer Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Markov generator of the
dynamics of classical dimers. A less well understood fact is that away from the
RK point the quantum-classical connection persists: in this case the
Hamiltonian corresponds to a non-stochastic ""tilted"" operator that encodes the
statistics of time-integrated observables of the classical stochastic problem.
This implies a direct relation between the phase behaviour of quantum dimers
and properties of ensembles of stochastic trajectories of classical dimers. We
make these ideas concrete by studying fully packed dimers on the square
lattice. Using transition path sampling - supplemented by trajectory umbrella
sampling - we obtain the large deviation statistics of dynamical activity in
the classical problem, and show the correspondence between the phase behaviour
of the classical and quantum systems. The transition at the RK point between
quantum phases of distinct order corresponds, in the classical case, to a
trajectory phase transition between active and inactive dynamical phases.
Furthermore, from the structure of stochastic trajectories in the active
dynamical phase we infer that the ground state of quantum dimers has columnar
order to one side of the RK point. We discuss how these results relate to those
from quantum Monte Carlo, and how our approach may generalise to other
problems.

well-known that the minimal distortion in this problem is attained by an

Next, we consider a compress-and-estimate (CE) source coding scheme, in which
the encoder first compresses the decimated sequence subject to an MSE criterion
(with respect to the decimated sequence), and the original random walk is
estimated only at the decoder. We evaluate the distortion under CE in a closed

Multiplying a vector by a TN matrix does not increase the number of sign
variations in the vector. In a largely forgotten paper, Schwarz (1970)
considered matrices whose exponentials are TN or TP. He also analyzed the
evolution of the number of sign changes in the vector solutions of the
corresponding linear system.
  In a seemingly different line of research, Smillie (1984), Smith (1991), and
others analyzed the stability of nonlinear tridiagonal cooperative systems by
using the number of sign variations in the derivative vector as an
integer-valued Lyapunov function.
  We provide a tutorial on these fascinating research topics and show that they
are intimately related. This allows to derive generalizations of the results by
Smillie (1984) and Smith (1991) while simplifying the proofs. It also opens the
door to many new and interesting research directions.

system Global Energy-Efficiency subject to both maximum power and minimum rate

is tackled through an interplay of fractional programming, learning, and game
theory. The proposed algorithmic framework is provably convergent and has a
complexity linear in both the number of users and subcarriers, whereas other
available solutions can only guarantee a polynomial complexity in the number of

to the set of constrained stationary points if the penalty parameter in the

longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in a set of platinum-coated yttrium
iron garnet (YIG) films of different thicknesses. The LSSE was induced by means
of pulsed microwave heating of the Pt layer and the spin currents were measured
electrically using the inverse spin Hall effect in the same layer. We
demonstrate that the time evolution of the LSSE is determined by the evolution
of the thermal gradient triggering the flux of thermal magnons in the vicinity
of the YIG/Pt interface. These magnons move ballistically within the YIG film
with a constant group velocity, while their number decays exponentially within
an effective propagation length. The ballistic flight of the magnons with
energies above 20K is a result of their almost linear dispersion law, similar
to that of acoustic phonons. By fitting the time-dependent LSSE signal for
different film thicknesses varying by almost an order of magnitude, we found
that the effective propagation length is practically independent of the YIG
film thickness. We consider this fact as strong support of a ballistic
transport scenario - the ballistic propagation of quasi-acoustic magnons in
room temperature YIG.

of the traffic light information based on vehicle-to-infrastructure
communication. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer programming, which is
equivalently transformed into optimal control problems by relaxing the integer
constraint. Then the direct adjoining approach is used to solve both free and
fixed terminal time optimal control problems subject to state constraints. By
an elaborate analysis, we are able to produce a real-time online analytical
solution, distinguishing our method from most existing approaches based on
numerical calculations. Extensive simulations are executed to compare the
performance of autonomous vehicles under the proposed speed profile and human

relax this limitation by introducing the MultI-Level Embedding (MILE) framework
-- a generic methodology allowing contemporary graph embedding methods to scale
to large graphs. MILE repeatedly coarsens the graph into smaller ones using a
hybrid matching technique to maintain the backbone structure of the graph. It
then applies existing embedding methods on the coarsest graph and refines the
embeddings to the original graph through a graph convolution neural network
that it learns. The proposed MILE framework is agnostic to the underlying graph
embedding techniques and can be applied to many existing graph embedding
methods without modifying them. We employ our framework on several popular
graph embedding techniques and conduct embedding for real-world graphs.
Experimental results on five large-scale datasets demonstrate that MILE
significantly boosts the speed (order of magnitude) of graph embedding while
generating embeddings of better quality, for the task of node classification.
MILE can comfortably scale to a graph with 9 million nodes and 40 million
edges, on which existing methods run out of memory or take too long to compute
on a modern workstation. Our code and data are publicly available with detailed
instructions for adding new base embedding methods:

field. Using the linear-response theory at zero temperature within the Dirac
approximation for the Landau levels, we present analytical expressions for both
valley and total Hall viscosity and conductivity up to $\bm q^2$ at all
frequencies. Although the final formulas for total Hall viscosity and
conductivity are similar to the ones previously obtained for gapless graphene,
the derivation reveals a significant difference between the two systems. First
of all, both the Hall viscosity and the Hall conductivity vanish when the Fermi
level lies in the gap that separates the lowest Landau level in the conduction
band from the highest Landau level in the valence band. It is only when the
Fermi level {\it is not} in the gap that the familiar formulas of gapless
graphene are recovered. Second, in the case of gapped graphene, it is not
possible (at least within our present approach) to define a single-valley Hall
viscosity: this quantity diverges with a strength proportional to the magnitude
of the gap. It is only when both valleys are included that the diverging terms,
having opposite signs in the two valleys, cancel out and the familiar result is
recovered. In contrast to this, the nonlocal Hall conductivity is finite in
each valley. These results indicate that the Hoyos-Son formula connecting the
Hall viscosity to the coefficient of $q^2$ in the small-$q$ expansion of the
$q$-dependent Hall conductivity cannot be applied to each valley, but only to
the system as a whole. The problem of defining a ""valley Hall viscosity""
remains open.

minimizes the number of edges and its clique number simultaneously. For the
interval supergraph, the problem can be restated as simultaneous minimization
of the pathwidth $pw(G)$ and the profile $p(G)$ of the input graph $G$. We
prove that for an arbitrary graph $G$ and an integer
$t\in\{1,\ldots,pw(G)+1\}$, there exists an interval supergraph $G'$ of $G$
such that for its clique number it holds
$\omega(G')\leq(1+\frac{2}{t})(pw(G)+1)$ and the number of its edges is bounded
by $|E(G')|\leq(t+2)p(G)$. In other words, the pathwidth and the profile of a
graph can be simultaneously minimized within the factors of $1+\frac{2}{t}$
(plus a small constant) and $t+2$, respectively. Note that for a fixed $t$,
both upper bounds provide constant factor approximations. On the negative side,
we show an example that proves that, for some graphs, there is no solution in
which both parameters are optimal.
  In case of finding a chordal supergraph, the two corresponding graph
parameters that reflect its clique size and number of edges are the treewidth
and fill-in. We obtain that the treewidth and the fill-in problems are also
`orthogonal' in the sense that for some graphs, a solution that minimizes one
of those parameters cannot minimize the other. As a motivating example, we
recall graph searching games which illustrates a need of simultaneous
minimization of these pairs of graph parameters.

of coordinate singularities often spoils numerical relativity simulations in
spherical coordinates, especially in the absence of any symmetry assumptions,
it has recently been demonstrated that these problems can be avoided if the

help of a reference-metric version of the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura

challenges the latter assumption. A simple model consisting of a uniform

dissipative Ohm current, (iii) the CME effect can be produced either by the

magnetic states with superconducting vortices. The hybrid samples are made of
array of nanomagnets embedded in superconducting Nb thin films. The vortex
motion detects relevant magnetic state features, since superconducting vortices
are able to discriminate between different magnetic stray field strengths and
directions. The usual matching effect between the superconducting vortex
lattice and the periodic pinning array can be quenched by means of disorder
magnetic potentials with strong stray fields at random. Ordered stray fields
retrieve the matching effect and yield asymmetry and shift in the vortex
dissipation signal. Furthermore vortices can discriminate the sizes of the
nanomagnet magnetic domains, detecting magnetic domain sizes as small as 70 nm.
In addition, we observe that the vortex cores play the crucial role instead of
the supercurrents around the vortex.

legged locomotion. Among the alternatives, spring-loaded inverted pendulum
(SLIP) model has shown to be a very accurate descriptor of animal locomotion.
Despite its wide use, the SLIP model includes non-integrable stance dynamics
that prevent analytical solutions for its equations of motion. Fortunately,
there are approximate analytical solutions for different SLIP variants.
However, the practicality of such approximations are mostly tested on
simulation studies with a few notable exceptions.
  This thesis extends upon a recent approximation to a hip torque actuated
dissipative SLIP (TD-SLIP) model that uses torque actuation to compensate for
energy losses. Systematic experiments for careful assessment of the predictive
performance of the approximate analytical solution is presented on a
well-instrumented one-legged hopping robot which is revised to enhance
compatibility and accuracy of the system. Electronic structure of the robot is
modified according to TD-SLIP model such that robot uses a real-time operating
system to increase processing speed. Using the parameters and results generated
by the predictive performance of the approximate analytical solution, a
model-based controller is designed and implemented on the robot platform to
generate a stable closed-loop running behaviour on the one legged hoping robot
platform. In addition, ground reaction forces during the stance phase on the
experimental platform is investigated and compared with the human running and
the traditional SLIP model data to understand if torque-actuated models
approximate natural locomotion better than traditional model.

challenges for detecting small numbers of spins. In this work, we use
fluorescence from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to detect the
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of optically inactive target
spins under various conditions of field magnitude and orientation. The protocol
requires neither direct microwave manipulation of the NV spins nor spectral
overlap between NV and target spin resonances, thus enabling broadband
detection. This unexpected non-resonant coupling is attributable to a
two-phonon process that relaxes NV spins proximate to the fluctuating dipole
moment of the target spin, suggesting that the sensitivity is determined by the
dipole-dipole coupling strength. This approach holds promise for sensitive EPR
detection, particularly in settings where control over the diamond-crystal
orientation is difficult. This is notably the case for biological sensing
applications, where nanodiamonds are being pursued for their bright, stable

The authors first review the notions of quasi-hereditary and stratified
algebras over a Noetherian commutative ring. They prove that many global
properties of these algebras hold if and only if they hold locally at every
prime ideal. When the commutative ring is sufficiently good, it is often
sufficient to check just the prime ideals of height at most one. These methods
are applied to construct certain generalized q-Schur algebras, proving they are
often quasi-hereditary (the ""good"" prime case) but always stratified. Finally,
these results are used to prove a triangular decomposition matrix theorem for
the modular representations of Hecke algebras at good primes. In the bad prime

triangular analogue of the good prime case is proved, where the blocks

time-scales ranging from real-time operation to long-term planning. This
process often involves solving similar optimization problems over and over
again with slightly modified input parameters, often under tight latency
requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available
through this repeated solution process to directly learn a model of the optimal
solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need to solve
computationally expensive large-scale parametric programs in real time. Our
proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active constraints, from
which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as
features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables
interpretable models, accounts for relevant safety constraints, and is easy to
represent and encode. However, the total number of active sets is also very
large, as it grows exponentially with system size. The key contribution of this
paper is a streaming algorithm that learns the relevant active sets from
training samples consisting of the input parameters and the corresponding
optimal solution, without any assumptions on the problem structure. The
algorithm comes with theoretical performance guarantees, and is known to
converge fast for problem instances with a small number of relevant active
sets. It can thus be used to establish the practicability of the learning
method. Through extensive experiments on the Optimal Power Flow problem, we
observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting
that the active sets is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning
algorithm to target.

number of reasonably good (or safe) policies are already known and we are only
interested in optimizing in their convex hull. We show that this problem is
NP-hard to solve exactly as well as to approximate to arbitrary accuracy.
However, under a condition that is akin to the occupancy measures of the base
policies having large overlap, we show that there exists an efficient algorithm

the base policies. The running time of the proposed algorithm is linear in the
number of states and polynomial in the number of base policies. In practice, we
demonstrate an efficient implementation for large state problems. Compared to
traditional policy gradient methods, the proposed approach has the advantage
that, apart from the computation of occupancy measures of some base policies,
the iterative method need not interact with the environment during the

viscosity provides a short-distance cutoff that allows us to define a bulk

changes, a topological phase transition occurs without closing the bulk gap.
Instead, at the transition point, the topological invariant becomes ill-defined
because momentum space cannot be compactified. This mechanism is unique to

thresholds can nevertheless be perceptually different to humans from the
corresponding benign examples. Namely, the perceptual distance between two
images that are ""near"" each other according to an $L_p$-norm can be high enough
that participants frequently classify the two images as representing different
objects or digits. Combined with prior work, we thus demonstrate that nearness
of inputs as measured by $L_p$-norms is neither necessary nor sufficient for
perceptual similarity, which has implications for both creating and defending
against adversarial examples. We propose and discuss alternative similarity
metrics to stimulate future research in the area.

increasingly attracted attention in the literature. Prior results have

to fall within the convex hull of initial agent states. However, the problem of

synthesized computed tomography (CT) data can provide X-ray attenuation map for
radiation therapy planning. In this work, we propose a generic cross-modality
synthesis approach with the following targets: 1) synthesizing realistic
looking 3D images using unpaired training data, 2) ensuring consistent
anatomical structures, which could be changed by geometric distortion in
cross-modality synthesis and 3) improving volume segmentation by using
synthetic data for modalities with limited training samples. We show that these
goals can be achieved with an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)
composed of mutually-beneficial generators and segmentors for image synthesis
and segmentation tasks. The generators are trained with an adversarial loss, a
cycle-consistency loss, and also a shape-consistency loss, which is supervised
by segmentors, to reduce the geometric distortion. From the segmentation view,
the segmentors are boosted by synthetic data from generators in an online
manner. Generators and segmentors prompt each other alternatively in an
end-to-end training fashion. With extensive experiments on a dataset including
a total of 4,496 CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cardiovascular

similarity metrics in an end-to-end manner based on the convolution neural

tasks.$L2$-normalization in the embedding space has been used to improve the
performance of several DDML methods. However, the commonly used Euclidean
distance is no longer an accurate metric for $L2$-normalized embedding space,
i.e., a hyper-sphere. Another challenge of current DDML methods is that their
loss functions are usually based on rigid data formats, such as the triplet
tuple. Thus, an extra process is needed to prepare data in specific formats. In
addition, their losses are obtained from a limited number of samples, which
leads to a lack of the global view of the embedding space. In this paper, we
replace the Euclidean distance with the cosine similarity to better utilize the
$L2$-normalization, which is able to attenuate the curse of dimensionality.
More specifically, a novel loss function based on the von Mises-Fisher
distribution is proposed to learn a compact hyper-spherical embedding space.
Moreover, a new efficient learning algorithm is developed to better capture the
global structure of the embedding space. Experiments for both classification
and retrieval tasks on several standard datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with a simpler training procedure. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that, even with a small number of convolutional layers, our model

between the total number of colors used and the treedepth bound, and prior
empirical work suggests that the former dominates the run time of existing
algorithms in practice. We introduce $p$-linear colorings as an alternative to
the commonly used $p$-centered colorings. They can be efficiently computed in
bounded expansion classes and use at most as many colors as $p$-centered

a subgraph of treedepth at most $k$, the same number of colors from a
$p$-linear coloring may induce subgraphs of larger treedepth. We establish a
polynomial upper bound on the treedepth in general graphs, and give tighter
bounds in trees and interval graphs via constructive coloring algorithms. We
also give a co-NP-completeness reduction for recognizing $p$-linear colorings

account for the spectra with observable turnovers. All but one of the FFA
models do not require a spectral break to account for the radio spectrum, while
all but one of the alternative SSA and power law models do require a spectral

then develop a convex representation of the original problem requiring the

direct method (DM), based on forbidden lines; and the temperature independent

heuristics use some score functions, such as common neighbors and Katz index,
to measure the likelihood of links. They have obtained wide practical uses due
to their simplicity, interpretability, and for some of them, scalability.
However, every heuristic has a strong assumption on when two nodes are likely
to link, which limits their effectiveness on networks where these assumptions
fail. In this regard, a more reasonable way should be learning a suitable
heuristic from a given network instead of using predefined ones. By extracting
a local subgraph around each target link, we aim to learn a function mapping
the subgraph patterns to link existence, thus automatically learning a
`heuristic' that suits the current network. In this paper, we study this
heuristic learning paradigm for link prediction. First, we develop a novel
$\gamma$-decaying heuristic theory. The theory unifies a wide range of
heuristics in a single framework, and proves that all these heuristics can be
well approximated from local subgraphs. Our results show that local subgraphs
reserve rich information related to link existence. Second, based on the
$\gamma$-decaying theory, we propose a new algorithm to learn heuristics from
local subgraphs using a graph neural network (GNN). Its experimental results
show unprecedented performance, working consistently well on a wide range of

lensing estimators used in the literature, denoted as $\Delta\Sigma$ and
$\gamma_+$, which are related as $\Delta\Sigma=\Sigma_{\rm cr}\gamma_+$, where
$\Sigma_{\rm cr}(z_l,z_s)$ is the critical surface mass density for each
lens-source pair ($z_l$ and $z_s$ are lens and source redshifts, respectively).
In this paper we derive a formula for the covariance matrix of
$\Delta\Sigma$-estimator focusing on `weight' function to improve the
signal-to-noise ($S/N$). We assume that the lensing fields and the distribution
of lensing objects obey the Gaussian statistics. With this formula, we show
that, if background galaxy shapes are weighted by an amount of $\Sigma_{\rm

shot noise limited regime. We also show that the $\Delta\Sigma$-estimator with
the weight $\Sigma_{\rm cr}^{-2}$ gives a greater $(S/N)^2$ than that of the
$\gamma_+$-estimator by about 5--25\% for lensing objects at redshifts
comparable with or higher than the median of source galaxy redshifts for
hypothetical Subaru HSC and DES surveys. However, for low-redshift lenses such
as $z_l<0.3$, the $\gamma_+$-estimator has higher $(S/N)^2$ than
$\Delta\Sigma$. We also discuss that the $(S/N)^2$ for $\Delta\Sigma$ at large
separations in the sample variance limited regime can be boosted, by up to a
factor of 1.5, if one adopts a weight of $\Sigma_{\rm cr}^{-\alpha}$ with
$\alpha>2$. Our formula allows one to explore how the combination of the
different estimators can approach an optimal estimator in all regimes of
redshifts and separation scales.

However, it's still below the 70% accuracy that humans could achieve in the
same task. Here, we propose a new method that combines knowledge of human
perception study in music genre classification and the neurophysiology of the
auditory system. The method works by training a simple convolutional neural
network (CNN) to classify a short segment of the music signal. Then, the genre
of a music is determined by splitting it into short segments and then combining
CNN's predictions from all short segments. After training, this method achieves
human-level (70%) accuracy and the filters learned in the CNN resemble the
spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) in the auditory system.

increasing attention. We explore a notion of robustness for generative

robust. Our notion of robustness relies on a perturbed discriminator, or noisy,
adversarial interference with its feedback. We explore, theoretically and
empirically, the effect of model and training properties on this robustness. In
particular, we show theoretical conditions for robustness that are supported by
empirical evidence. We also test the effect of regularization. Our results
suggest variations of GANs that are indeed more robust to noisy attacks and
have more stable training behavior, requiring less regularization in general.
Inspired by our theoretical results, we further extend our framework to obtain
a class of models related to WGAN, with good empirical performance. Overall,
our results suggest a new perspective on understanding and designing GAN models

improve the traditional ones to a certain extent by adaptively allocating CR

explicitly constructs a mathematical model for the CR allocation (CRA) problem
in CC and proposes a novel fine-grained CRA (FCRA) strategy by fully
considering both the theoretically optimal solution of the CRA model and the
evolution characteristics of CC. FCRA takes a single iteration as a basic CRA
unit and always selects the subproblem which is most likely to make the largest
contribution to the total fitness improvement to undergo a new iteration, where
the contribution of a subproblem at a new iteration is estimated according to
its current contribution, current evolution status as well as the estimation
for its current contribution. We verified the efficiency of FCRA by combining
it with SHADE which is an excellent differential evolution variant but has
never been employed in the CC framework. Experimental results on two benchmark
suites for LSOPs demonstrate that FCRA significantly outperforms existing CRA
strategies and the resultant CC algorithm is highly competitive in solving
LSOPs.

adversarial examples, formed by applying small but malicious perturbations to
the original inputs. Moreover, the perturbations can \textit{transfer across
models}: adversarial examples generated for a specific model will often mislead
other unseen models. Consequently the adversary can leverage it to attack
deployed systems without any query, which severely hinder the application of
deep learning, especially in the areas where security is crucial. In this work,
we systematically study how two classes of factors that might influence the
transferability of adversarial examples. One is about model-specific factors,
including network architecture, model capacity and test accuracy. The other is
the local smoothness of loss function for constructing adversarial examples.
Based on these understanding, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to
enhance transferability. We call it variance-reduced attack, since it utilizes
the variance-reduced gradient to generate adversarial example. The
effectiveness is confirmed by a variety of experiments on both CIFAR-10 and

spin-orbit coupled Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ by epitaxial strain using density functional
methods. Structural optimization shows that strain changes the internal
structural parameters such as the Ir-O-Ir bond angle, which has an important
effect on the band structure. An interesting prediction is the $\Gamma - $X
crossover of the valence band maximum with strain, while the conduction minimum
at M remains unchanged. This in turn suggests strong strain dependence of the
transport properties for the hole doped system, but not when the system is
electron-doped. Taking the measured value of the $\Gamma-X$ separation for the
unstrained case, we predict the $\Gamma - $X crossover of the valence band
maximum to occur for the tensile epitaxial strain $e_{xx} \approx 3\%$. A
minimal tight-binding model within the $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ subspace is
developed to describe the main features of the band structure. The optical
absorption spectra under epitaxial strain are computed using density-functional
theory, which explains the observed anisotropy in the optical spectra with the
polarization of the incident light. We show that the optical transitions
between the Ir (d) states, which are dipole forbidden, can be explained in
terms of the admixture of Ir (p) orbitals with the Ir (d) bands.

to directly detect the absorption of molecular species in the spectra of
planets and substellar companions when these are not present in the spectrum of
the star. We analyzed archival data of $\beta$ Pictoris taken with the SINFONI
integral field spectrograph (VLT), originally taken to image $\beta$ Pic b
using ADI techniques. At each spatial position in the field, a scaled instance
of the stellar spectrum is subtracted from the data after which the residuals
are cross-correlated with model spectra. The cross-correlation co-adds the
individual absorption lines of the planet emission spectrum constructively, but
not residual telluric and stellar features. Cross-correlation with CO and
H$_2$O models results in significant detections of $\beta$ Pic b at SNRs of
14.5 and 17.0 respectively. Correlation with a 1700K BT-Settl model provides a
signal with an SNR of 25.0. This contrasts with ADI, which barely reveals the
planet. While the AO system only achieved modest Strehl ratios of 19-27%
leading to a raw contrast of 1:240 at the planet position, cross-correlation
achieves a 3$\sigma$ contrast limit of $2.5\times10^{-5}$ in this 2.5h data set

precisely computed. The experiments show that, while maintaining the similar
recognition performance, our RRM yields averagely 2x acceleration on the
commonly used CNNs such as AlexNet, ResNet, deep compression model (thus 8-12x
faster than the original dense models using the efficient inference engine),
and impressively 9x acceleration on some binary networks such as XNOR-Nets
(thus 500x faster than the original model). We further verify the effectiveness
of the RRM on speeding up CNNs for video pose estimation and video object

personality shift, or transient and circumstantial ones, like seasonal changes
in item popularities. Disregarding these temporal drifts in modelling user
preferences can result in unhelpful recommendations. Moreover, different
temporal patterns can be associated with various preference domains, and
preference components and their combinations. These components comprise
preferences over features, preferences over feature values, conditional
dependencies between features, socially-influenced preferences, and bias. For
example, in the movies domain, the user can change his rating behaviour (bias
shift), her preference for genre over language (feature preference shift), or
start favouring drama over comedy (feature value preference shift). In this
paper, we first propose a novel latent factor model to capture the
domain-dependent component-specific temporal patterns in preferences. The
component-based approach followed in modelling the aspects of preferences and
their temporal effects enables us to arbitrarily switch components on and off.
We evaluate the proposed method on three popular recommendation datasets and
show that it significantly outperforms the most accurate state-of-the-art
static models. The experiments also demonstrate the greater robustness and
stability of the proposed dynamic model in comparison with the most successful
models to date. We also analyse the temporal behaviour of different preference
components and their combinations and show that the dynamic behaviour of
preference components is highly dependent on the preference dataset and domain.
Therefore, the results also highlight the importance of modelling temporal
effects but also underline the advantages of a component-based architecture
that is better suited to capture domain-specific balances in the contributions
of the aspects.

To help
the developers debug, numerous information retrieval (IR)-based and
spectrum-based bug localization techniques have been devised. IR-based
techniques process textual information in bug reports, while spectrum-based
techniques process program spectra (i.e., a record of which program elements
are executed for each test case). While both techniques ultimately generate a
ranked list of program elements that likely contain a bug, they only consider
one source of information--either bug reports or program spectra--which is not
optimal. In light of this deficiency, this paper presents a new approach dubbed
Network-clustered Multi-modal Bug Localization (NetML), which utilizes
multi-modal information from both bug reports and program spectra to localize
bugs. NetML facilitates an effective bug localization by carrying out a joint
optimization of bug localization error and clustering of both bug reports and
program elements (i.e., methods). The clustering is achieved through the
incorporation of network Lasso regularization, which incentivizes the model
parameters of similar bug reports and similar program elements to be close
together. To estimate the model parameters of both bug reports and methods,
NetML employs an adaptive learning procedure based on Newton method that
updates the parameters on a per-feature basis. Extensive experiments on 355
real bugs from seven software systems have been conducted to benchmark NetML
against various state-of-the-art localization methods. The results show that
NetML surpasses the best-performing baseline by 31.82%, 22.35%, 19.72%, and

horizon lives in a dual gravitational bulk theory with Newton's constant
$G_{\rm bulk}$, and the relation involves a factor of $4G_{\rm bulk}$. The fact
that CHI is bounded below by the von Neumann entropy $S$ suggests that CHI is
coarse-grained. Its properties could thus differ markedly from those of $S$. In
particular, recent results imply that when $d\le 4$ holographic QFTs are
perturbatively coupled to $d$-dimensional gravity, the combined system
satisfies the so-called quantum focusing condition (QFC) at leading order in
the new gravitational coupling $G_d$ when the QFT entropy is taken to be that
of von Neumann. However, by studying states dual to spherical bulk (anti--de
Sitter) Schwarschild black holes in the conformal frame for which the boundary
is a $(2+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space, we find the QFC defined by CHI is
violated even when perturbing about a Killing horizon and using a single null
congruence. Since it is known that a generalized second law (GSL) holds in this
context, our work demonstrates that the QFC is not required in order for an
entropy, or an entropy-like quantity, to satisfy such a GSL.

higher housing prices than that of staying migrants. We formulate a churn

perspective, the size effects can be rationalized by considering two
mechanisms: (i) the nucleation is a rare and stochastic event, and thus, its
rate is correlated with the volume and/or surface area of a given sample; (ii)
when the sample size decreases, the dominant heterogeneous nucleation sites
that play a primary role for relatively large samples are annealed out. We
experimentally verified the size effects on the supercooling phenomena for two
different types of strongly correlated electron systems: the transition-metal
dichalcogenide IrTe$_2$ and the organic conductor
$\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$RbZn(SCN)$_4$. The origin of the size effects considered

therefore, they may often be involved in the first-order-transition behavior of

transports synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs). In this study, the number of
active UNC-104 molecules hauling a single SVP in axons in the worm
Caenorhabditis elegans was counted by applying a newly developed non-invasive
force measurement technique. The distribution of the force acting on a SVP
transported by UNC-104 was spread out over several clusters, implying the
presence of several force-producing units (FPUs). We then compared the number
of FPUs in the wild-type worms with that in arl-8 gene-deletion mutant worms.
ARL-8 is a SVP-bound arf-like small guanosine triphosphatase, and is known to
promote unlocking of the autoinhibition of the motor, which is critical for
avoiding unnecessary consumption of adenosine triphosphate when the motor does
not bind to a SVP. There were fewer FPUs in the arl-8 mutant worms. This
finding indicates that a lack of ARL-8 decreased the number of active UNC-104
motors, which then led to a decrease in the number of motors responsible for
SVP transport.

critical field, the modulated CSL continuously evolves from a helicity-rich to
a ferromagnetic domain-rich structure, where the crossover is revealed by the
onset of an anomalous nonlinear magnetic response that coincides with extremely
slow dynamics. The behavior is indicative of the formation of a spatially
coherent array of large ferromagnetic domains which relax on macroscopic
time-scales. The frequency dependence of the ac magnetic loss displays an
asymmetric distribution of relaxation times across the highly nonlinear CSL
regime, which shift to shorter time-scales with increasing temperature. We

computations of sets of decoupled nonlinear evolutionary and linear static
equations. In CGP, the linear equations are solved on a coarsened mesh compared
to the nonlinear equations, leading to a reduction in central processing unit
(CPU) time. The accuracy of the CGP scheme has been assessed for the
advection-diffusion equation along with the pressure Poisson equation. Here we
add another decoupled equation to this set: the energy equation. In this
article, we examine the influence of CGP methodology for the first time on
thermal fields. To this purpose, a semi-implicit-time-integration
unstructured-triangular-finite-element CGP version is selected. The CGP
platform is validated with two different test cases: first, natural convection
induced by a hot circular cylinder located in the center of a cold square
cylinder, and second, the flow over a circular cylinder with the condition of
constant cylinder temperature. Regarding the first test case, the CGP and
non-CGP simulations are carried out for different Rayleigh numbers. The
velocity and temperature fields as well as the local Nusselt number on the
surface of the inner hot cylinder calculated by CGP reveal good agreement with
the non-CGP data. Concerning the second test case, the temperature variable is
used as the passive scalar. For different Prandtl numbers, we compare the CGP
and non-CGP configurations according to the Nusselt number and the spatial
structure of the scalar field obtained. The phase lag between the standard and
CGP approaches is transmitted from the velocity field into the temperature
filed, and thus into the local transient Nusselt number. For one and two levels
of coarsening, the numerical predictions by CGP for the unsteady local heat
transfer coefficients agree well with available data in the literature.

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been shown that cooperative coevolution (CC) can effectively deal with
large scale optimization problems (LSOPs) through a divide-and-conquer
strategy. However, its performance is severely restricted by the current
context-vector-based sub-solution evaluation method since this method needs to
access the original high dimensional simulation model when evaluating each
sub-solution and thus requires many computation resources. To alleviate this
issue, this study proposes a novel surrogate model assisted cooperative
coevolution (SACC) framework. SACC constructs a surrogate model for each
sub-problem obtained via decomposition and employs it to evaluate corresponding
sub-solutions. The original simulation model is only adopted to reevaluate some
good sub-solutions selected by surrogate models, and these real evaluated
sub-solutions will be in turn employed to update surrogate models. By this
means, the computation cost could be greatly reduced without significantly
sacrificing evaluation quality. To show the efficiency of SACC, this study uses
radial basis function (RBF) and success-history based adaptive differential
evolution (SHADE) as surrogate model and optimizer, respectively. RBF and SHADE
have been proved to be effective on small and medium scale problems. This study
first scales them up to LSOPs of 1000 dimensions under the SACC framework,
where they are tailored to a certain extent for adapting to the characteristics
of LSOP and SACC. Empirical studies on IEEE CEC 2010 benchmark functions
demonstrate that SACC significantly enhances the evaluation efficiency on
sub-solutions, and even with much fewer computation resource, the resultant
RBF-SHADE-SACC algorithm is able to find much better solutions than traditional
CC algorithms.

crucial demands on solving large-scale optimization problems. However, the
accelerated versions of asynchronous algorithms are rarely studied. In this

asynchronous algorithms for convex problems. Specifically, we first accelerate
the plain Asynchronous Gradient Descent, which achieves a faster
$O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ (v.s. $O(1/\epsilon)$) convergence rate for non-strongly
convex functions, and $O(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\epsilon))$ (v.s. $O(\kappa
\log(1/\epsilon))$) for strongly convex functions to reach an $\epsilon$-
approximate minimizer with the condition number $\kappa$. We further apply the
technique to accelerate modern stochastic asynchronous algorithms such as
Asynchronous Stochastic Coordinate Descent and Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient
Descent. Both of the resultant practical algorithms are faster than existing
ones by order. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider
accelerated algorithms that allow updating by delayed gradients and are the
first to propose truly accelerated asynchronous algorithms. Finally, the
experimental results on a shared memory system show that acceleration can lead
to significant performance gains on ill-conditioned problems.

However, the back-propagated values of different layers vary dramatically. This
inconsistence of gradient magnitude across different layers renders
optimization of deep neural network with a single learning rate problematic. We
introduce the back-matching propagation which computes the backward values on

high computational cost. We then reduce the back-matching propagation with

collisions is an important phenomena. It is quite useful to find a universal
freezeout condition for each and every nuclear collisions. In this article, we
have constructed a hybrid model to calculate the ratio of transverse energy to
total mean multiplicity $E_{T} /N_{ch}$, since this ratio can possibly act as a
freezeout condition in heavy-ion collision experiments. Present hybrid model
blends two approaches : Tsallis statistics and wounded quark approach.
Recently, Tsallis statistics has been reliably used to obtain the transverse
momentum distribution of charged hadrons produced in relativistic ion
collisions. On the other side it has been shown that the pseudorapidity
distribution of charged hadrons can be calculated satisfactorily using the
wounded quark model (WQM). We have used this hybrid model to calculate the
transverse energy density distributions, $dE_{T}/d\eta$ at midrapidity using
charged particle pseudorapidity distributions, $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ and mean
transverse momentum $\langle p_{T} \rangle$ in various type of nuclear
collisions. We found that present hybrid model satisfactorily explains the
experimental data whether other models fail to reproduce the data at central
and at peripheral collisions simultaneously. Finally, ratio of transverse
energy to total mean multiplicity, $E_{T} /N_{ch}$ has been computed within
hybrid model and compared with the available experimental data at RHIC and LHC
energies. We observed no explicit dependence of $E_{T} /N_{ch}$ on energy as
well as centrality and thus it can definitely act as a freezeout criteria.

These systems are approximated by a sequence of Hamiltonian systems having an

systems are sub-islands of the islands in the initial system with an infinite

demonstrate that it works. In particular the statistical characteristics of the

classification via minimizing the information bottleneck (IB) functional. We
show that the resulting optimization problem suffers from two severe issues:
First, for deterministic DNNs, either the IB functional is infinite for almost
all values of network parameters, making the optimization problem ill-posed, or
it is piecewise constant, hence not admitting gradient-based optimization
methods. Second, the invariance of the IB functional under bijections prevents
it from capturing properties of the learned representation that are desirable
for classification, such as robustness and simplicity. We argue that these
issues are partly resolved for stochastic DNNs, DNNs that include a (hard or
soft) decision rule, or by replacing the IB functional with related, but more
well-behaved cost functions. We conclude that recent successes reported about
training DNNs using the IB framework must be attributed to such solutions. As a
side effect, our results indicate limitations of the IB framework for the
analysis of DNNs. We also note that rather than trying to repair the inherent
problems in the IB functional, a better approach may be to design regularizers
on latent representation enforcing the desired properties directly.

However, BN brings additional computation, consumes more memory and generally
slows down the training process by a large margin, which aggravates the
training effort. Furthermore, the nonlinear square and root operations in BN
also impede the low bit-width quantization techniques, which draws much
attention in deep learning hardware community. In this work, we propose an
L1-norm BN (L1BN) with only linear operations in both the forward and the
backward propagations during training. L1BN is shown to be approximately
equivalent to the original L2-norm BN (L2BN) by multiplying a scaling factor.
Experiments on various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative
adversarial networks (GANs) reveal that L1BN maintains almost the same
accuracies and convergence rates compared to L2BN but with higher computational
efficiency. On FPGA platform, the proposed signum and absolute operations in
L1BN can achieve 1.5$\times$ speedup and save 50\% power consumption, compared
with the original costly square and root operations, respectively. This
hardware-friendly normalization method not only surpasses L2BN in speed, but
also simplify the hardware design of ASIC accelerators with higher energy

that, even in the weakly interacting regime where the bulk topological pumping

the equation of motion for a particle ensemble in the coordinate+parameter
space, (ii)~performing moment analysis on the transport equation for the
probability density function (PDF), and (iii)~expanding up to the first-order
the drift (and the diffusion coefficient) around the mean of the PDF. Following
these steps, a system of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of

differential equations enable for the approximation of the acoustophoretic
separation dynamics of particle ensembles by using a gaussian mixture for which
the mean and the covariance of each gaussian evolve according to the

shown by comparison with direct numerical simulations of particle ensembles in

other data-intensive areas such as high-energy physics or astroinformatics.
Over the last decade, deep learning has become a disruptive advance in machine
learning, giving new live to the long-standing connectionist paradigm in
artificial intelligence. Deep learning methods are ideally suited to
large-scale data and, therefore, they should be ideally suited to knowledge
discovery in bioinformatics and biomedicine at large. In this brief paper, we
review key aspects of the application of deep learning in bioinformatics and
medicine, drawing from the themes covered by the contributions to an ESANN 2018
special session devoted to this topic.

  Combinatorial Optimization Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In robust combinatorial optimization with discrete uncertainty, two general
approximation algorithms are frequently used, which are both based on
constructing a single scenario representing the whole uncertainty set. In the
midpoint method, one optimizes for the average case scenario. In the
element-wise worst-case approach, one constructs a scenario by taking the worst
case in each component over all scenarios. Both methods are known to be
$N$-approximations, where $N$ is the number of scenarios.
  In this paper, these results are refined by reconsidering their respective
proofs as optimization problems. We present a linear program to construct a
representative scenario for the uncertainty set, which guarantees an
approximation guarantee that is at least as good as for the previous methods.
Incidentally, we show that the element-wise worst-case approach can have an
advantage over the midpoint approach if the number of scenarios is large. In
numerical experiments on the selection problem we demonstrate that our approach
can improve the approximation guarantee of the midpoint approach by around 20%.

further discuss the introduction of priors on the model parameters for
situations where excitation is insufficient for identification. The

applicable to, e.g., ARX models and state-space models with time-varying

well as in model-based, trajectory centric reinforcement learning on a smooth

waves in the solar tachocline is studied. A sub-adiabatic temperature gradient
in the upper overshoot layer of the tachocline causes significant reduction of
surface gravity speed, which leads to trapping of the waves near the equator
and to an increase of the Rossby wave period up to the timescale of solar
cycles. Dispersion relations of all equatorial magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
shallow water waves are obtained in the upper tachocline conditions and solved
analytically and numerically. It is found that the toroidal magnetic field
splits equatorial Rossby and Rossby-gravity waves into fast and slow modes. For
a reasonable value of reduced gravity, global equatorial fast magneto-Rossby
waves (with the spatial scale of equatorial extent) have a periodicity of 11
years, matching the timescale of activity cycles. The solutions are confined
around the equator between latitudes 20-40, coinciding with sunspot activity
belts. Equatorial slow magneto-Rossby waves have a periodicity of 90-100 yr,
resembling the observed long-term modulation of cycle strength, i.e., the
Gleissberg cycle. Equatorial magneto-Kelvin and slow magneto-Rossby-gravity
waves have the periodicity of 1-2 years and may correspond to observed annual
and quasi-biennial oscillations. Equatorial fast magneto-Rossby-gravity and
magneto-inertia-gravity waves have periods of hundreds of days and might be
responsible for observed Rieger-type periodicity. Consequently, the equatorial
MHD shallow water waves in the upper overshoot tachocline may capture all
timescales of observed variations in solar activity, but detailed analytical
and numerical studies are necessary to make a firm conclusion toward the
connection of the waves to the solar dynamo.

transition from Bose-Einstein distribution to Poisson distribution with
increasing the mean photon number. The second order degree of coherence
decreases gradually from 2 to 1. Based on Hanbury Brown-Twiss scheme,
pronounced photon bunching is observed experimentally for various injection
currents and feedback strengths, which indicates the randomness of the
associated emission light. Near-threshold injection currents and strong

part of the observed IMBPs with short orbital periods. In this work, we
investigate the evolution of about 900 ONe WD+He star binaries to explore the
distribution of IMBPs. We found that the ONe WD+He star scenario could form
IMBPs including pulsars with 5-340 ms spin periods and 0.75-1.38 Msun WD
companions, in which the orbital periods range from 0.04 to 900 d. Compared
with the 20 observed IMBPs, this scenario can cover the parameters of 13

can explain almost all the observed IMBPs with short orbital periods. This work

Presidential Debate in 2016 (#DebateNight) and we analyze its 1.5 million users
from three perspectives: user influence, political behavior (partisanship and
engagement) and botness. First, we define a measure of user influence based on
the user's active contributions to information diffusions, i.e. their tweets
and retweets. Given that Twitter does not expose the retweet structure - it
associates all retweets with the original tweet - we model the latent diffusion
structure using only tweet time and user features, and we implement a scalable
novel approach to estimate influence over all possible unfoldings. Next, we use
partisan hashtag analysis to quantify user political polarization and
engagement. Finally, we use the BotOrNot API to measure user botness (the
likelihood of being a bot). We build a two-dimensional ""polarization map"" that
allows for a nuanced analysis of the interplay between botness, partisanship
and influence. We find that not only social bots are more active on Twitter -
starting more retweet cascades and retweeting more -- but they are 2.5 times
more influential than humans, and more politically engaged. Moreover,
pro-Republican bots are both more influential and more politically engaged than
their pro-Democrat counterparts. However we caution against blanket statements
that software designed to appear human dominates political debates. We find
that many highly influential Twitter users are in fact pro-Democrat and that
most pro-Republican users are mid-influential and likely to be human (low
botness).

environments that are subject to uncertainties and not fully observable.
Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural formal
model to capture such problems. Because of the potentially huge or even
infinite belief space in POMDPs, synthesis with safety guarantees is, in
general, computationally intractable. We propose an approach that aims to
circumvent this difficulty: in scenarios that can be partially or fully
simulated in a virtual environment, we actively integrate a human user to
control an agent. While the user repeatedly tries to safely guide the agent in
the simulation, we collect data from the human input. Via behavior cloning, we
translate the data into a strategy for the POMDP. The strategy resolves all
nondeterminism and non-observability of the POMDP, resulting in a discrete-time
Markov chain (MC). The efficient verification of this MC gives quantitative
insights into the quality of the inferred human strategy by proving or
disproving given system specifications. For the case that the quality of the
strategy is not sufficient, we propose a refinement method using
counterexamples presented to the human. Experiments show that by including
humans into the POMDP verification loop we improve the state of the art by
orders of magnitude in terms of scalability.

companion from decades of ground-based spectroscopic radial velocity
measurements. Using Gaussian Process-based Continuous Auto-Regressive Moving
Average (CARMA) models, we show that these historic data also contain evidence
of acoustic oscillations in the star itself, and verify this result with
further dedicated ground-based spectroscopy and space-based photometry with the
Kepler Space Telescope. From the frequency of these oscillations we determine
the mass of Aldebaran to be $1.16 \pm 0.07 \, M_\odot$, and note that this
implies its planet will have been subject to insolation comparable to the Earth
for some of the star's main sequence lifetime. Our approach to sparse,
irregularly sampled time series astronomical observations has the potential to
unlock asteroseismic measurements for thousands of stars in archival data, and
push to lower-mass planets around red giant stars.

multi-tenant data centers. Modern cloud applications frequently exhibit
one-to-many communication patterns and, at the same time, require
sub-millisecond latencies and high throughput. IP multicast can achieve these
requirements but has control- and data-plane scalability limitations that make
it challenging to offer it as a service for hundreds of thousands of tenants,
typical of cloud environments. Tenants, therefore, must rely on unicast-based
approaches (e.g., application-layer or overlay-based) to support multicast in
their applications, imposing overhead on throughput and end host CPU
utilization, with higher and unpredictable latencies.
  Elmo scales network multicast by taking advantage of emerging programmable
switches and the unique characteristics of data-center networks; specifically,
the symmetric topology and short paths in a data center. Elmo encodes multicast
group information inside packets themselves, reducing the need to store the
same information in network switches. In a three-tier data-center topology with
27K hosts, Elmo supports a million multicast groups using a 325-byte packet
header, requiring as few as 1.1K multicast group-table entries on average in
leaf switches, with a traffic overhead as low as 5% over ideal multicast.

functionalization represents a critical tool for tuning the properties of TMDCs
for use in many applications. However, the chemical inertness of semiconducting
TMDCs has thus far hindered the robust chemical functionalization of these

converting TMDCs into metallic phases prior to covalent attachment. Here, we
demonstrate the direct covalent functionalization of the basal planes of
unmodified semiconducting MoS2 using aryl diazonium salts without any

results in covalent C-S bonds, is applicable to MoS2 derived from a range of
different synthesis methods, and enables a range of different functional groups
to be tethered directly to the MoS2 surface. Using density functional theory
calculations including van der Waals interactions and atomic-scale scanning
probe microscopy studies, we demonstrate a novel reaction mechanism in which
cooperative interactions enable the functionalization to propagate along the
MoS2 basal plane. The flexibility of this covalent chemistry employing the
diverse aryl diazonium salt family is further exploited to tether active
proteins to MoS2, suggesting future biological applications and demonstrating
its use as a versatile and powerful chemical platform for enhancing the utility

computationally study the microstructure evolution and magnetic properties of

output from CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD). Based on the relation
between residual stress and magnetoelastic energy, magnetic properties of SLM
processed Fe-Ni alloys (magnetic coercivity, remanent magnetization, and
magnetic domain structure) are examined by micromagnetic simulations. The
calculated coercivity is found to be in line with the experimentally measured
values of SLM-processed Fe-Ni alloys. This computation study demonstrates a
feasible approach for the simulation of additively manufactured magnetic

previously. The cross-correlation function (CCF) of the optical and near-IR
data reveals a strong, broad negative anti-correlation at negative lags, a
broad positive correlation at positive lags, with a strong, positive narrow
correlation superimposed. The shape of the CCF resembles the CCF of black hole
X-ray binaries but the time-scales are different. The features can be explained
by reprocessing and a hot accretion flow close to the neutron star's
magnetospheric radius. The optical emission is dominated by the reprocessed
component, whereas the near-IR emission contains the emission from plasmoids in
the hot accretion flow and a reprocessed component. The rapid active-passive
state transition occurs when the hot accretion flow material is channelled onto
the neutron star and is expelled from its magnetosphere. During the transition
the optical reprocessing component decreases resulting in the removal of a blue
spectral component. The accretion of clumpy material through the magnetic
barrier of the neutron star produces the observed near-IR/optical CCF and
variability. The dip at negative lags corresponds to the suppression of the
near-IR synchrotron component in the hot flow, whereas the broad positive
correlation at positive lags is driven by the increased synchrotron emission of
the outflowing plasmoids. The narrow peak in the CCF is due to the delayed
reprocessed component, enhanced by the increased X-ray emission.

the transition temperature evidenced in the dielectric data at ca. 100 kHz
shifts below zero Kelvin for very low frequencies, heat capacity data collected

probably contaminated by the wind expansion that introduces another symmetry
axis, namely, the radial direction, as indicated by recent numerical
simulations. These simulations also show that while the expansion is strong,
the principal fluctuations are in the plane perpendicular to the radial
direction. Using this property, we separate 11 yr of Wind spacecraft data into
two subsets characterized by strong and weak expansion and determine the
corresponding turbulence anisotropy. Under strong expansion, the small-scale
anisotropy is consistent with the Goldreich & Sridhar critical balance. As in
previous works, when the radial symmetry axis is not eliminated, the turbulent
structures are field-aligned tubes. Under weak expansion, we find 3D anisotropy
predicted by the Boldyrev model, that is, turbulent structures are ribbons and
not tubes. However, the very basis of the Boldyrev phenomenology, namely, a
cross-helicity increasing at small scales, is not observed in the solar wind:
the origin of the ribbon formation is unknown.

single bit of instructions for each vertex and no use of memory. Large
instructions without memory do not bring any advantage. With one bit of
instructions and one bit of memory for each vertex, we can construct a family
of perfect graphs that strictly includes threshold graphs. We consider the case
in which memory lasts for a single time step, and show that as well as the
standard threshold graphs, linear forests are also producible. We show further
that the number of random bits (with no memory or instructions) needed to

performance gains for at least half of the benchmarks for both processors. An

tagged particle is subject to the external time-dependent oscillatory field.
Here we extend the GLE and the corresponding FDT for the more general case
where both the tagged particle and the bath oscillators respond to an external

immersed in a bath of other particles that are also charged or polarizable,
under an external AC electric field. For this Hamiltonian, we find that the
ensemble average of the stochastic force is not zero, but proportional to the
AC field. The associated FDT reads as $\langle

often involves solving ill-posed inverse problems. Recently, deep feed-forward
neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in solving various inverse
imaging problems. However, being task specific, these networks have to be
learned for each inverse problem. On the other hand, a more flexible approach
would be to learn a deep generative model once and then use it as a signal
prior for solving various inverse problems. We show that among the various
state of the art deep generative models, autoregressive models are especially
suitable for our purpose for the following reasons. First, they explicitly
model the pixel level dependencies and hence are capable of reconstructing
low-level details such as texture patterns and edges better. Second, they
provide an explicit expression for the image prior which can then be used for
MAP based inference along with the forward model. Third, they can model long
range dependencies in images which make them ideal for handling global
multiplexing as encountered in various compressive imaging systems. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in solving three
computational imaging problems: Single Pixel Camera (SPC), LiSens and FlatCam.

$\mu^+\,\rightarrow\,e^+ e^- e^+$ with the aim of a final sensitivity of one
signal decay in $10^{16}$ observed muon decays, an improvement over the
preceding SINDRUM experiment by four orders of magnitude. In the first phase,
the experiment will be operated at an existing intense muon beam line at the
Paul Scherrer Institute. With muon stopping rates of about
$10^{8}\text{s}^{-1}$, a single-event sensitivity of $2\cdot 10^{-15}$ can be
achieved. For the ultimate sensitivity, a new high intensity muon beam line is
required. In order to suppress background, the tracking detector is designed to
measure low momentum electron and positron tracks with excellent precision by
making use of very thin silicon pixel sensors. In addition, scintillating
fibres and tiles provide precise timing information. Currently, the
collaboration is finalizing the detector design and preparing for construction
and commissioning.

(1,1,2)-trichloroethane is studied by means of broadband dielectric
spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The dielectric spectra of
polycrystalline samples obtained by crystallization from the liquid phase
exhibit, besides a space-charge relaxation associated with accumulation of
charges at crystalline domain boundaries, two loss features arising from
dipolar molecular relaxations. The most prominent and slower of the two loss
features is identified as a configurational leap of the molecules which
involves a simultaneous change in spatial orientation and structural
conformation, namely between two isomeric forms (gauche$^+$ and gauche$^-$) of
opposite chirality. In this peculiar dynamic process, the positions of the
three chlorine atoms in the crystal lattice remain unchanged, while those of
the carbon and hydrogen atoms are modified. This dynamic process is responsible
for the disorder observed in an earlier x-ray diffraction study and confirmed
by our simulation, which is present only at temperatures relatively close to
the melting point, starting 40 K below. The onset of the disorder is visible as
an anomaly in the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity of the sample
at exactly the same temperature. While the slower relaxation dynamics (combined
isomerization/reorientation) becomes increasingly more intense on approaching
the melting point, the faster dynamics exhibits significantly lower but
constant dielectric strength. Based on our molecular dynamics simulations, we
assign the faster relaxation to large fluctuations of the molecular dipole
moments, partly due to large-angle librations of the chloroethane species.

specifying and combining the steps in producing forensic casework
electropherograms of short tandem repeat loci from DNA samples. It is
applicable to both high and low template DNA samples, that is, samples
containing either high or low amounts DNA. A specific model is developed within
the framework, by way of particular modelling assumptions and approximations,
and its interpretive power presented on examples using simulated data and data
from a publicly available dataset. The framework relies heavily on the use of
univariate and multivariate probability generating functions. It is shown that
these provide a succinct and elegant mathematical scaffolding to model the key
steps in the process. A significant development in this paper is that of new
numerical methods for accurately and efficiently evaluating the probability
distribution of amplicons arising from the polymerase chain reaction process,
which is modelled as a discrete multi-type branching process. Source code in

models. Although the scalar nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) has
constantly played a central role for rogue wave investigations, moving beyond
the standard NLSE model is relevant and needful for describing more general

technology of high-speed telecommunication-grade components, and relying on a
careful design of the nonlinear propagation of orthogonally-polarized optical

a lot of efforts are being made to develop semiconductor materials whose
structure is compatible with the graphene lattice. In this perspective, little
pieces of graphene represent a promising alternative. In particular, their
electronic, optical and spin properties can be in principle controlled by
designing their size, shape and edges. As an example, graphene nanoribbons with
zigzag edges have localized spin polarized states. Likewise, singlet-triplet
energy splitting can be chosen by designing the structure of graphene quantum
dots. Moreover, bottom-up molecular synthesis put these potentialities at our

the intrinsic properties of a single graphene quantum dot. In particular, we

program may perturb independently within the given lower and upper bounds.
However, contrarily to classical linear programming, an interval program cannot
always be converted into a desired form without affecting its properties, due
to the so-called dependency problem.
  In this paper, we discuss the common transformations used in linear
programming, such as imposing non-negativity on free variables or splitting
equations into inequalities, and their effects on interval programs.
Specifically, we examine changes in the set of all optimal solutions, optimal
values and the optimal value range. Since some of the considered properties do
not holds in the general case, we also study a special class of interval
programs, in which uncertainty only affects the objective function and the
right-hand-side vector. For this class, we obtain stronger results.

Magnetic reconnection occurs during the interaction of continuous and steady
flows of super-Alfvenic, magnetized, aluminum plasma, which collide in a
geometry with two-dimensional symmetry, producing a stable and long-lasting
reconnection layer. Optical Thomson scattering measurements show that when the
layer forms, ions inside the layer are more strongly heated than electrons,
reaching temperatures of Ti~ZTe>300 eV - much greater than can be expected from
strong shock and viscous heating alone. Later in time, as the plasma density in
the layer increases, the electron and ion temperatures are found to
equilibrate, and a constant plasma temperature is achieved through a balance of
the heating mechanisms and radiative losses of the plasma. Measurements from
Faraday rotation polarimetry also indicate the presence of significant magnetic
field pile-up occurring at the boundary of the reconnection region, which is
consistent with the super-Alfvenic velocity of the inflows.

for removing impulse noise in image restoration. This type of noise frequently
arises in data acquisition and transmission due to many reasons, e.g. a faulty
sensor or analog-to-digital converter errors. Removing this noise is an
important task in image restoration. State-of-the-art methods such as Adaptive
Outlier Pursuit(AOP) \cite{yan2013restoration}, which is based on TV with
$\ell_{02}$-norm data fidelity, only give sub-optimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a new sparse optimization method, called $\ell_0TV$-PADMM,
which solves the TV-based restoration problem with $\ell_0$-norm data fidelity.
To effectively deal with the resulting non-convex non-smooth optimization
problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent biconvex Mathematical Program
with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), and then solve it using a proximal
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM). Our $\ell_0TV$-PADMM
method finds a desirable solution to the original $\ell_0$-norm optimization
problem and is proven to be convergent under mild conditions. We apply
$\ell_0TV$-PADMM to the problems of image denoising and deblurring in the
presence of impulse noise. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
$\ell_0TV$-PADMM outperforms state-of-the-art image restoration methods.

the same query is repeatedly run on the same input. However, the numerous
sources of non-determinism in modern systems make reproducible results
difficult to achieve. This is particularly true if floating-point numbers are
involved, where the order of the operations affects the final result.
  As part of a larger effort to extend database engines with data
representations more suitable for machine learning and scientific applications,
in this paper we explore the problem of making relational GroupBy over
floating-point formats bit-reproducible, i.e., ensuring any execution of the
operator produces the same result up to every single bit. To that aim, we first
propose a numeric data type that can be used as drop-in replacement for other
number formats and is---unlike standard floating-point formats---associative.
We use this data type to make state-of-the-art GroupBy operators reproducible,
but this approach incurs a slowdown between 4x and 12x compared to the same
operator using conventional database number formats. We thus explore how to
modify existing GroupBy algorithms to make them bit-reproducible and efficient.
By using vectorized summation on batches and carefully balancing batch size,
cache footprint, and preprocessing costs, we are able to reduce the slowdown
due to reproducibility to a factor between 1.9x and 2.4x of aggregation in
isolation and to a mere 2.7% of end-to-end query performance even on
aggregation-intensive queries in MonetDB. We thereby provide a solid basis for
supporting more reproducible operations directly in relational engines.

star-formation history (SFH). We argue that the populations within this inner
disk, not the entire disk, are the same, and that the outer Lindblad resonance
(OLR) of the bar plays a key role in explaining this uniformity. In our model
of a two-phase star formation history, the metallicity, [$\alpha$/Fe] and
[$\alpha$/H] distributions, and age-metallicity relation are all compatible
with the observations of both the inner disk and bulge. The dip at
[Fe/H]$\sim$0 dex seen in the metallicity distributions of the bulge and inner
disk reflects the quenching episode in the SFH of the inner MW at age $\sim$8
Gyr, and the common evolution of the bulge and inner disk stars. We show that
at z$\le$1.5, when the MW was starting to quench, transitioning between the end
of the $\alpha$-enhanced thick disk formation to the start of the thin disk,
and yet was still gas rich, the gas accretion rate could not have been
significant. The [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratio before and after this quenching
phase would be different, which is not observed. The present analysis suggests
that Milky Way history, and in particular at the transition from the thick to
the thin disk -- the epoch of the quenching -- must have been driven by a
decrease of the star formation efficiency. We argue that the decline in the
intensity of gas accretion, the formation of the bar, and the quenching of the
SFR at the same epoch may be causally connected thus explaining their temporal
coincidence (abridged).

rate function for the GLOA exhibits non-analyticity at a critical time, which
corresponds to the dynamical quantum phase transition. We observe that the
dynamical quantum phase transition related to GLOA is not destroyed under a
finite temperature and weak enough dissipation. In particular, we find that a
new type of dynamical quantum phase transition emerges in a dissipation system.
The proposed GLOA provides a powerful tool in the investigation of a dynamical
quantum phase transition in an arbitrary quantum system, which not only can
characterize the robustness of the dynamical quantum phase transition but also
can be used to search for new transitions.

reading model to five additional documents, four of them by Darwin: the first
edition of $\textit{The Origin of Species}$, two private essays stating
intermediate forms of his theory in 1842 and 1844, a third essay of disputed

address three historical inquiries, previously treated qualitatively: 1) the
mythology of ""Darwin's Delay,"" that despite completing an extensive draft in
1844, Darwin waited until 1859 to publish $\textit{The Origin of Species}$ due
to external pressures; 2) the relationship between Darwin and Wallace's
contemporaneous theories, especially in light of their joint presentation; and
3) dating of the ""Outline and Draft"" which was rediscovered in 1975 and
postulated first as an 1839 draft preceding the Sketch of 1842, then as an
interstitial draft between the 1842 and 1844 essays.

either form highly correlated states of magnetic trimers or dimers or remain as
weakly interacting orphan spins. At low temperature ($T$), the dimer response
is negligible, and magnetism is dominated by the trimers and orphans. To
explore the role of magnetic frustration, disorder and possibly of quantum
fluctuations, the low-$T$ magnetic properties of the remaining magnetic degrees

as well that dynamic magnetism persists at low $T$. Our results are interpreted

congestion games with polynomial cost functions. In particular, for any
positive integer $d$ we construct rather simple games with cost functions of
degree at most $d$ which have a PoS of at least $\varOmega(\Phi_d)^{d+1}$,
where $\Phi_d\sim d/\ln d$ is the unique positive root of equation
$x^{d+1}=(x+1)^d$. This almost closes the huge gap between $\varTheta(d)$ and
$\Phi_d^{d+1}$. Our bound extends also to network congestion games. We further
show that the PoS remains exponential even for singleton games. More generally,
we provide a lower bound of $\varOmega((1+1/\alpha)^d/d)$ on the PoS of
$\alpha$-approximate Nash equilibria for singleton games. All our lower bounds
hold for mixed and correlated equilibria as well.
  On the positive side, we give a general upper bound on the PoS of
$\alpha$-approximate Nash equilibria, which is sensitive to the range $W$ of
the player weights and the approximation parameter $\alpha$. We do this by
explicitly constructing a novel approximate potential function, based on
Faulhaber's formula, that generalizes Rosenthal's potential in a continuous,
analytic way. From the general theorem, we deduce two interesting corollaries.
First, we derive the existence of an approximate pure Nash equilibrium with PoS
at most $(d+3)/2$; the equilibrium's approximation parameter ranges from
$\varTheta(1)$ to $d+1$ in a smooth way with respect to $W$. Secondly, we show
that for unweighted congestion games, the PoS of $\alpha$-approximate Nash

usage arising from the on-line interactive communications among users. While
this situation contributes significantly to the quality of human life,
unfortunately it involves enormous dangers, since on-line texts with high
toxicity can cause personal attacks, on-line harassment and bullying behaviors.
This has triggered both industrial and research community in the last few years
while there are several tries to identify an efficient model for on-line toxic
comment prediction. However, these steps are still in their infancy and new
approaches and frameworks are required. On parallel, the data explosion that
appears constantly, makes the construction of new machine learning
computational tools for managing this information, an imperative need.
Thankfully advances in hardware, cloud computing and big data management allow
the development of Deep Learning approaches appearing very promising
performance so far. For text classification in particular the use of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have recently been proposed approaching
text analytics in a modern manner emphasizing in the structure of words in a
document. In this work, we employ this approach to discover toxic comments in a
large pool of documents provided by a current Kaggle's competition regarding
Wikipedia's talk page edits. To justify this decision we choose to compare CNNs
against the traditional bag-of-words approach for text analysis combined with a
selection of algorithms proven to be very effective in text classification. The
reported results provide enough evidence that CNN enhance toxic comment
classification reinforcing research interest towards this direction.

discussion are less likely to be a part of an idiomatic expression. Our
additional hypothesis is that contexts in which idioms occur, typically, are
more affective and therefore, we incorporate a simple analysis of the intensity
of the emotions expressed by the contexts. We investigate the bag of words
topic representation of one to three paragraphs containing an expression that
should be classified as idiomatic or literal (a target phrase). We extract
topics from paragraphs containing idioms and from paragraphs containing
literals using an unsupervised clustering method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). Since idiomatic expressions exhibit the property of
non-compositionality, we assume that they usually present different semantics
than the words used in the local topic. We treat idioms as semantic outliers,
and the identification of a semantic shift as outlier detection. Thus, this
topic representation allows us to differentiate idioms from literals using
local semantic contexts. Our results are encouraging.

$\mathrm{M}_\odot/\mathrm{L}_\odot$), which are unphysical for standard stellar
population models, confirming they are sub-maximal. The maximum-disc

luminosity. The mean ratio between baryonic and observed velocity at the peak
of the baryonic contribution is
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{bar}}/{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{p}} \approx 0.88$, but

interaction, which leads to the production of fluid motion at very fine scales,
uncovers direct evidence of a novel iterative cascade of instabilities in a
bulk fluid. When the coherent vortex cores approach each other, they deform
into tent-like structures, and the mutual strain causes them to locally flatten
into extremely thin vortex sheets. These sheets then break down into smaller
secondary vortex filaments, which themselves rapidly flatten and break down
into even smaller tertiary filaments. By performing numerical simulations of
the full Navier-Stokes equations, we also resolve one iteration of this
instability and highlight the subtle role that viscosity must play in the
rupturing of a vortex sheet. The concurrence of this observed iterative cascade
of instabilities over various scales with those of recent theoretical
predictions could provide a new mechanistic framework in which the evolution of
turbulent flows can be examined in real-time as a series of discrete dynamic
instabilities.

decomposition. This combinatorial model is designed for our state sum
construction of two-dimensional topological field theories on r-spin surfaces.
We show that an example of such a topological field theory computes the
Arf-invariant of an r-spin surface as introduced in Geiges, Gonzalo (2012) and
Randal-Williams (2014). This implies in particular that the r-spin
Arf-invariant is constant on orbits of the mapping class group, providing an
alternative proof of that fact.

scalar-valued query function. Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and
Gaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding
i.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often sub-optimal as
it forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically
associated with matrix analysis. In this work, we consider the design of
differential privacy mechanism specifically for a matrix-valued query function.
The proposed solution is to utilize a matrix-variate noise, as opposed to the
traditional scalar-valued noise. Particularly, we propose a novel differential
privacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism, which
adds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution.
We prove that the MVG mechanism preserves $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential
privacy, and show that it allows the structural characteristics of the
matrix-valued query function to naturally be exploited. Furthermore, due to the
multi-dimensional nature of the MVG mechanism and the matrix-valued query, we
introduce the concept of directional noise, which can be utilized to mitigate
the impact the noise has on the utility of the query. Finally, we demonstrate
the performance of the MVG mechanism and the advantages of directional noise
using three matrix-valued queries on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find
that the MVG mechanism notably outperforms four previous state-of-the-art
approaches, and provides comparable utility to the non-private baseline. Our
work thus presents a promising prospect for both future research and
implementation of differential privacy for matrix-valued query functions.

recently been shown to be effective in improving the performance of global
interconnects. Such techniques can reduce the signal swing in the interconnect
by using a capacitive divider network and does not require an additional
voltage supply. However, the large reduction in signal swing makes it necessary
to use differential signaling and amplification for successful regeneration at
the receiver, which add area and static power. ME effect induced magnetization
reversal has recently been proposed which shows the possibility of using a low
voltage to switch a nanomagnet adjacent to a multi-ferroic oxide. Here, we
propose an ME effect based receiver that uses the low voltage at the receiving
end of the global wire to switch a nanomagnet. The nanomagnet is also used as
the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the resistance of which is
tuned through the ME effect. This change in MTJ resistance is converted to full
swing binary signals by using simple digital components. This process allows
capacitive low swing interconnection without differential signaling or
amplification, which leads to significant energy efficiency. Our simulation
results indicate that for 5-10 mm long global wires in IBM 45 nm technology,

firstly model the users movements as a one-order unknown Markov process, which
is blindly learned by the expectation and maximization (EM) approach. Then, the
up-link time varying spatial information can be blindly tracked by Taylor
series expansion of the steering vector, while the rest up-link channel gain
information can be trained by only a few pilot symbols. Due to angle

reduces the complexity of down-link channel tracking. Various numerical results

parameter estimation for the dynamic system where observational data is
obtained sequentially in time.
  To reduce uncertainty and accelerate posterior inference, a two-stage
ensemble Kalman filter is presented to improve the sequential analysis of EnKF.
It is known that the final posterior ensemble may be concentrated in a small
portion of the entire support of the initial prior ensemble. It will be much
more efficient if we first build a new prior by some partial observations, and
construct a surrogate only over the significant region of the new prior. To
this end, we construct a very coarse model using generalized multiscale finite
element method (GMsFEM) and generate a new prior ensemble in the first stage.
GMsFEM provides a set of hierarchical multiscale basis functions supported in
coarse blocks. This gives flexibility and adaptivity to choosing degree of
freedoms to construct a reduce model. In the second stage, we build an initial
surrogate model based on the new prior by using GMsFEM and sparse generalized
polynomial chaos (gPC)-based stochastic collocation methods. To improve the
initial surrogate model, we dynamically update the surrogate model, which is
adapted to the sequential availability of data and the updated analysis. The
two-stage EnKF can achieve a better estimation than standard EnKF, and
significantly improve the efficiency to update the ensemble analysis (posterior
exploration). To enhance the applicability and flexibility in Bayesian inverse
problems, we extend the two-stage EnKF to non-Gaussian models and hierarchical
models. In the paper, we focus on the time fractional diffusion-wave models in
porous media and investigate their Bayesian inverse problems using the proposed

system will also have univariate monomials. Although it is a well-known fact
that finding a root of a quadratic polynomial equation system is a NP-hard

So if a desirable chess problem was successfully generated by examining

behaviour of the balloon. In the baseline simulation, we consider a 10 tonne
rocket lifted to an altitude of 18 km. We model the trajectory of the balloon
by taking into account steam adiabatic cooling, surface cooling, water
condensation and balloon aerodynamic drag. The required steam mass proves to be
only 1.4 times the mass of the rocket stage and the ascent time is around 10
minutes. For small payloads, surface cooling increases the relative amount of
steam needed, unless insulation is applied to the balloon skin. The
ground-filled steam balloon seems to be an attractive and sustainable method of
lifting payloads such as rockets into high altitude.

particular because some red fluorescent proteins (RFP) produce and release
reactive oxygen species (ROS). The photogeneration of ROS is considered as a
detrimental side effect in cellular imaging or is proactively utilized for
ablating cancerous tissue. As ancient textiles or biomaterials, silk produced
by silkworms can directly be used as fabrics or be processed into materials and
structures to host other functional nanomaterials. We report that transgenic
fusion of far-red fluorescent protein (mKate2) with silk provides a
photosensitizer hybridization platform for photoinducible control of ROS.
Taking advantage of green (visible) light activation, native and regenerated
mKate2 silk can produce and release superoxide and singlet oxygen, in a
comparable manner of visible light-driven plasmonic photocatalysis. Thus, the
genetic expression of mKate2 in silk offers immediately exploitable and
scalable photocatalyst-like biomaterials. We further envision that mKate2 silk
could potentially rule out hazardous concerns associated with foreign
semiconductor photocatalytic nanomaterials.

One 3D-printing process, direct laser writing, polymerises a light-sensitive
material by steering a focused laser beam through the shape of the object to be
created. The highest-resolution direct laser writing systems use a femtosecond
laser to effect two-photon polymerisation. The focal (polymerisation) point is
steered over the shape of the desired object with mechanised stages or
galvanometer-controlled mirrors. Here we report a new high-resolution direct
laser writing system that employs a resonant mirror scanner to achieve a
significant increase in printing speed over galvanometer- or piezo-based
methods while maintaining resolution on the order of a micron. This printer is
based on a software modification to a commerically available resonant-scanning
two-photon microscope. We demonstrate the complete process chain from hardware
configuration and control software to the printing of objects of approximately
$400\times 400\times 350\;\mu$m, and validate performance with objective
benchmarks. Released under an open-source license, this work makes micro-scale
3D printing available the large community of two-photon microscope users, and
paves the way toward widespread availability of precision-printed devices.
