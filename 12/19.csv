investigation of key aspects of the proposed Sample Clock Frequency Offset
(SCFO) scheme for the Mid SKA1 telescope. This is a scheme, first proposed by
one author (Carlson) at a meeting at the SKAO 25-Jan-2013, to digitize the
analog signal at each antenna at a slightly different sample rate and transmit
the data to the CSP Mid.CBF for subsequent digital re-sampling to a common
sample clock frequency before channelization, correlation, and beamforming. The
primary purpose for doing this is to cause de-correlation of sample
clock-related self-interference to be able to improve correlated and beamformed
signal quality. This report includes an investigation of the efficacy of the
method, investigation of its implementation by SADT, DISH, and CSP,
presentation of further supporting modeling results augmenting the original
modeling work, a note on expansion to SKA-2, as well as possible draw-backs and
concerns. Finally, there are potential additional benefits in signal quality in
implementing the SCFO scheme, in particular de-correlation of aliased RFI
(particularly for Nyquist Zone-2 digitized signals) as well as relaxation of
signal-chain anti-aliasing filters transition band roll-off and reject band
attenuation prior to digitization in the antenna.

variety of discrete and continuous control tasks; however, they can be slow to
train and require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn
a suitable policy. This is borne out by the fact that a reinforcement learning
agent has no prior knowledge of the world, no pre-existing data to depend on
and so must devote considerable time to exploration. Transfer learning can
alleviate some of the problems by leveraging learning done on some source task
to help learning on some target task. Our work presents an algorithm for
initialising the hidden feature representation of the target task. We propose a
domain adaptation method to transfer state representations and demonstrate
transfer across domains, tasks and action spaces. We utilise adversarial domain
adaptation ideas combined with an adversarial autoencoder architecture. We
align our new policies' representation space with a pre-trained source policy,
taking target task data generated from a random policy. We demonstrate that
this initialisation step provides significant improvement when learning a new
reinforcement learning task, which highlights the wide applicability of
adversarial adaptation methods; even as the task and label/action space also
changes.

this region of parameter space we find that some of the flavour-violating

due to the delicate interplay between the smuon and neutralino masses. By
scanning over GUT scale flavour violating parameters, constrained by low-energy
quark and lepton flavour violating observables, we find a striking difference
in the results in which individual parameters are varied to those where
multiple parameters are varied simultaneously, where the latter relaxes the
constraints on flavour violating parameters due to cancellations and/or
correlations. Since charged lepton-flavour violation provides the strongest
constraints within a GUT framework, due to relations between quark and lepton
flavour violation, we examine in detail a prominent correlation between some of
the flavour violating parameters at the GUT scale consistent with the stringent
lepton flavour violating process $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$. We also examine
the relation between GUT scale and low scale flavour violating parameters, for
both quarks and leptons, and show how the usual expectations may be violated
due to the correlations when multiple parameters are varied simultaneously.

The hard (jet) partons are produced along with soft partons in the initial
state EPOS approach. The soft partons, represented by strings, melt into a
thermalized medium which is described by a 3 dimensional event-by-event viscous
hydrodynamic approach. The jet partons then propagate in the hydrodynamically
expanding medium. The total jet energy gets progressively `degraded' when the
partons reaching a thermal energy scale are melted into the hydrodynamic medium

separating the thermalized and jet parts. We demonstrate how the transverse

Reparametrization invariance links different operators in the Heavy-Quark
expansion thus reducing the number of independent operators at $1/m_b^4$ to
eight for the total rate. We show that this reduction also holds for spectral
moments as long as they are defined by reparametrization invariant

$V_{cb}$ is determined by fitting the energy and hadronic mass moments, which
do not manifest this parameter reduction and depend on the full set of 13
matrix elements up to $1/m_b^4$. In light of this, we propose an experimental
analysis of the $q^2$ moments to open the possibility of a model-independent

unpolarised deuteron target as measured by COMPASS with a Monte Carlo program,
based on the ${}^3P_0$ model of quark anti-quark pair production at string
breaking, which accounts for the Cahn effect. Large differences have been
observed between data and Monte Carlo, in particular at large values of the
fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the fragmenting quark carried by the

from exclusive vector mesons contaminating the SIDIS sample, which also exhibit
large azimuthal modulations. Using the measurements of the exclusive reaction

reasonably well the observed differences. Subtracting the contribution of

extracting $\langle k_T^2 \rangle$ and the Boer-Mulders function.

functional deconvolution model with the two-parameter fractional Gaussian
noise. We derive the lower bounds for the $L^p$-risk, $1 \leq p < \infty$, and
taking advantage of the Riesz poly-potential, we apply a wavelet-vaguelette
expansion to de-correlate the anisotropic fractional Gaussian noise. We
construct an adaptive wavelet hard-thresholding estimator that attains
asymptotically quasi-optimal convergence rates in a wide range of Besov balls.
Such convergence rates depend on a delicate balance between the parameters of
the Besov balls, the degree of ill-posedness of the convolution operator and
the parameters of the fractional Gaussian noise. A limited simulations study
confirms theoretical claims of the paper. The proposed approach is extended to
the general $r$-dimensional case, with $r> 2$, and the corresponding
convergence rates do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

multiple-peaks and single clusters with single-peaks from the CAMIRA cluster

the merging clusters is $\sim70\%$ smaller than that of the single-peak
clusters, which agrees well with predictions of numerical simulations. The
spatial distribution of subhalos is less centrally concentrated than the mass
distribution of the main halo. The fractions of red galaxies in the merging
clusters are not higher than those of the single-peak clusters. We find a
signature of the merger boost of the ICM from stacked Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich

X-ray surface brightness distribution, aligned with the main-subhalo pairs of
low redshift and massive clusters, shows that the central gas core is elongated

to their hydrogen-deficient (non-DA) counterparts at the very hot end of the WD
cooling sequence. The three hottest known DAs (surface gravity log g $\geq$
7.0) have effective temperatures around Teff = 140,000 K, followed by only five
objects in the range 104,000 - 120,000 K. They are by far outnumbered by forty
non-DAs with Teff = 100,000 - 250,000 K, giving a DA/non-DA ratio of 0.2. In
contrast, this ratio is the inverse of that for the cooler WDs. One reason for
this discrepancy could be uncertainties in the temperature determination of hot
DAs using Balmer-line spectroscopy. Recent investigations involving
metal-ionization balances in ultraviolet (UV) spectra indeed showed that the
temperatures of some DAs were underestimated, but the paucity of extremely hot
DAs prevailed. Here we present the results of a UV spectral analysis of one of
the three hottest DAs, PG0948+534. We find that its temperature was strongly
overestimated by recent Balmer line analyses. We correct it downward to 105,000
$\pm$ 5000 K, aggravating the hot-DA paucity. The Balmer-line problem
encountered previously is not resolved by our non-LTE line-blanketed model
atmospheres. We speculate that it might be related to the possible presence of
a magnetosphere. This is supported by the V-band variability that shows a
period of P=3.45 d (amplitude 0.19 mag), which we interpret as the star's
rotation period. The metal abundances in PG0948+534 are affected by atomic
diffusion and we conclude that the onset of diffusion in hot DAs occurs when
they cool below Teff about 105,000 K. We discuss the possibility that the
paucity of very hot DAs is a consequence of their fast evolutionary rate.

web of voids, walls, filaments and nodes. The anisotropic nature of
collisionless collapse leads to the emergence of an anisotropic velocity
dispersion, or stress, that absorbs most of the kinetic energy after
shell-crossing. In this paper, we measure this large-scale velocity dispersion
tensor $\sigma^2_{ij}$ in $N$-body simulations using the phase-space
interpolation technique. We study the environmental dependence of the amplitude
and anisotropy of the velocity dispersion tensor field, and measure its spatial
correlation and alignment. The anisotropy of $\sigma^2_{ij}$ naturally encodes
the collapse history and thus leads to a parameter-free identification of the
four dynamically distinct cosmic web components. We find this purely dynamical
classification to be in good agreement with some of the existing classification
methods. In particular, we demonstrate that $\sigma^2_{ij}$ is well aligned
with the large-scale tidal field. We further investigate the influence of small
scale density fluctuations on the large scale velocity dispersion, and find
that the measured amplitude and alignments are dominated by the largest
perturbations and thus remain largely unaffected. We anticipate that these
results will give important new insight into the anisotropic nature of
gravitational collapse on large scales, and the emergence of anisotropic stress

interesting similarities with Taub-bolt. In doing so, we slightly generalise
known results on harmonic spinors on Euclidean Schwarzschild.

  Demonstrations of Algorithmic Effectiveness in the Machine Learning and
  Artificial Intelligence Literature",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: To determine the completeness of argumentative steps necessary to
conclude effectiveness of an algorithm in a sample of current ML/AI supervised
learning literature.
  Data Sources: Papers published in the Neural Information Processing Systems
(NeurIPS, n\'ee NIPS) journal where the official record showed a 2017 year of
publication.
  Eligibility Criteria: Studies reporting a (semi-)supervised model, or
pre-processing fused with (semi-)supervised models for tabular data.
  Study Appraisal: Three reviewers applied the assessment criteria to determine
argumentative completeness. The criteria were split into three groups,
including: experiments (e.g real and/or synthetic data), baselines (e.g
uninformed and/or state-of-art) and quantitative comparison (e.g. performance
quantifiers with confidence intervals and formal comparison of the algorithm
against baselines).
  Results: Of the 121 eligible manuscripts (from the sample of 679 abstracts),
99\% used real-world data and 29\% used synthetic data. 91\% of manuscripts did
not report an uninformed baseline and 55\% reported a state-of-art baseline.
32\% reported confidence intervals for performance but none provided references
or exposition for how these were calculated. 3\% reported formal comparisons.
  Limitations: The use of one journal as the primary information source may not
be representative of all ML/AI literature. However, the NeurIPS conference is
recognised to be amongst the top tier concerning ML/AI studies, so it is
reasonable to consider its corpus to be representative of high-quality
research.
  Conclusion: Using the 2017 sample of the NeurIPS supervised learning corpus
as an indicator for the quality and trustworthiness of current ML/AI research,
it appears that complete argumentative chains in demonstrations of algorithmic
effectiveness are rare.

model by using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations in three

critical temperature, $T_c$, the properties of the marginal model are exactly
the same as a normal ferromagnet with continuous symmetry-breaking, our results
show that a novel zero-temperature critical point emerges, so that in its

correlation length of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, in
complete analogy with experimental data on natural flocks of starlings.

graph latent variables z (such as object appearance, camera position). Given a
current estimate of z we can render a prediction of the image g(z), which can
be compared to the image x. The standard way to proceed is then to measure the
error E(x, g(z)) between the two, and use an optimizer to minimize the error.
However, it is unknown which error measure E would be most effective for
simultaneously addressing issues such as misaligned objects, occlusions,
textures, etc. In contrast, the LiDO approach trains a Prediction Network to
predict an update directly to correct z, rather than minimizing the error with
respect to z. Experiments show that our LiDO method converges rapidly as it
does not need to perform a search on the error landscape, produces better
solutions than error-based competitors, and is able to handle the mismatch
between the data and the fitted scene model. We apply LiDO to a realistic
synthetic dataset, and show that the method also transfers to work well with
real images.

generate inputs that are as similar as possible to the inputs in common usage
of the program, to test the reliability of the program. More interesting is the
second scenario where inputs should be as dissimilar as possible from normal

common usage, and determine probabilities for individual grammar production as
they occur during parsing the inputs. Replicating these probabilities during
grammar-based test input generation, we obtain inputs that are close to the

dissimilar to common inputs, yet still valid with respect to the grammar. Our
evaluation on three common input formats (JSON, JavaScript, CSS) shows the

be finite when her strategies are restricted to be absolutely continuous and
infinite when this restriction is not imposed. This implies that the folk
result doesn't hold for those pricing rules and that they are not consistent

consistent with equilibrium and prove that, when a pricing rule satisfies these
necessary conditions, the insider's optimal strategy is absolutely continuous,
thus obtaining the classical result in a more general setting.
  This, furthermore, allows us to justify the standard assumption of absolute
continuity of insider's strategies since one can construct a pricing rule
satisfying the necessary conditions derived in the paper that yield the same
price process as the pricing rules employed in the modern literature when
insider's strategies are absolutely continuous.

networked control system improves the quality of regulation, it has indeed a
price from the communication perspective. It is, therefore, rational that such
a data packet be transmitted only if it is valuable in the sense of a
cost-benefit analysis. Yet, the fact is that little is known so far about this
valuation of information and its connection with traditional event-triggered
communication. In the present article, we study this intrinsic property of
networked control systems by formulating a rate-regulation tradeoff between the
packet rate and the regulation cost with an event trigger and a controller as
two distributed decision makers, and show that the valuation of information is
conceivable and quantifiable grounded on this tradeoff. In particular, we
characterize an equilibrium in the rate-regulation tradeoff, and quantify the
value of information $\text{VoI}_k$ there as the variation in a so-called value
function with respect to a piece of sensory information that can be
communicated to the controller at each time $k$. We prove that, for a
multi-dimensional Gauss-Markov process, $\text{VoI}_k$ is a symmetric function
of the discrepancy between the state estimates at the event trigger and the
controller, and that a data packet containing sensory information at time $k$
should be transmitted to the controller only if $\text{VoI}_k$ is nonnegative.
Moreover, we discuss that $\text{VoI}_k$ can be computed with arbitrary

quantitative definition of cratering families based on the fraction in volume
of the fragments with respect to the parent body; fragmentation families are
above this empirical boundary. We assess the compositional homogeneity of the
families and their shape in proper element space by computing the differences
of the proper elements of the fragments with respect to the ones of the major
body, looking for anomalous asymmetries produced either by post-formation
dynamical evolution, or by multiple collisional/cratering events, or by a
failure of the Hierarchical Clustering Method (HCM) for family identification.
We identified a total of 25 dynamical families with more than 100 members
ranging from moderate to heavy cratering. For three families (4, 15 and 283) we
confirm the occurrence of two separate cratering events. For family 20, we
propose a double collision origin, not previously identified. In four cases
(31, 480, 163 and 179) we performed a dedicated search for dynamical resonant
transport mechanisms that could have substantially changed the shape of the
family. By using a new synthetic method for computation of secular frequencies,
we found possible solutions for families 31, 480, and 163, but not for family
179, for which we propose a new interpretation, based on a secular resonance
contaminating this family: the family of 179 should be split into two separate
clusters, one containing (179) itself and the other, family (9506) Telramund,
of fragmentation type, for which we have computed an age.

horizontal-branch stars closely resemble the magnetic chemically peculiar stars
of the upper main sequence, which show photometric variability caused by
abundance spots on their surfaces. These spots are thought to be caused by
diffusion and the presence of a stable magnetic field. However, the latter does
not seem to be axiomatic. We searched for rotationally induced variability in
30 well-established bright field blue horizontal-branch stars in the solar
neighbourhood and searched the literature for magnetic fields measurements of
our targets. We employed archival photometric time series data from the ASAS,
ASAS-SN, and SuperWASP surveys. The data were carefully reduced and processed,
and a time series analysis was applied using several different techniques. We
also synthesized existing photometric and spectroscopic data of magnetic
chemically peculiar stars in order to study possible different surface
characteristics producing lower amplitudes. In the accuracy limit of the
employed data, no significant variability signals were found in our sample
stars. The resulting upper limits for variability are given. We conclude that
either no stellar surface spots are present in field blue horizontal-branch
stars, or their characteristics (contrast, total area, and involved elements)
are not sufficient to produce amplitudes larger than a few millimagnitudes in
the optical wavelength region. New detailed models taking into account the
elemental abundance pattern of blue horizontal-branch stars are needed to
synthesize light curves for a comparison with our results.

elucidate the proposal that the infinite tower of states is generated by the
discrete symmetries associated to infinite distance points. In the large volume
regime the infinite tower of states is generated by the action of the local
monodromy matrices and encoded by an orbit of D-brane charges. We express these
monodromy matrices in terms of the triple intersection numbers to classify the
infinite distance points and construct the associated infinite charge orbits
that become massless. We then turn to a detailed study of charge orbits in
elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. We argue that for these geometries
the modular symmetry in the moduli space can be used to transfer the large
volume orbits to the small elliptic fiber regime. The resulting orbits can be
used in compactifications of M-theory that are dual to F-theory
compactifications including an additional circle. In particular, we show that
there are always charge orbits satisfying the distance conjecture that
correspond to Kaluza-Klein towers along that circle. Integrating out the KK
towers yields an infinite distance in the moduli space thereby supporting the
idea of emergence in that context.

next-to-leading-logarithmic evolution. We provide the first numerical estimates

at its significance for the $\alpha$-attractor scenario of inflation. We show
that the conjecture itself suggests that inflation may arise as an infinite
distance phenomenon with the asymptotic kinetic structure typical of
$\alpha$-attractors. Furthermore, we argue that a proper string realisation of
these cosmological models in Calabi-Yau manifolds should occur around infinite

inflation should not take place in the limit where the inflaton kinetic term
develops a pole but rather in the opposite regime. Finally, we study the
constraints that the SDC poses on $\alpha$-attractors and show that they still
leave considerable room for compatibility with observations.

relationships between input and output data sets, has shown preliminary success
in some HPC problems. Using machine learning, scientists are able to augment
existing simulations by improving accuracy and significantly reducing
latencies. Our ongoing research work is to create a general framework to apply
neural network-based models to HPC applications. In particular, we want to use
the neural network to approximate and replace code regions within the HPC
application to improve performance (i.e., reducing the execution time) of the
HPC application. In this paper, we present our preliminary study and results.
Using two applications (the Newton-Raphson method and the Lennard-Jones (LJ)
potential in LAMMP) for our case study, we achieve up to 2.7x and 2.46x
speedup, respectively.

the overall charge transport as a sequence of non-adiabatic electron transfers,
the rates of which depend on both outer and inner-sphere vibrational

are determined by a combination of electron-electron and electron-vibrational

environment. Furthermore, we assess the importance of nuclear tunnelling and
examine the suitability of semi-classical Marcus theory as a description of
charge transport in molecular devices.

and modern techniques in Reifenberg theory. At its heart, Reifenberg theory is
about studying general sets or measures which can be, in one sense or another,
approximated on all scales by well behaved spaces, typically just Euclidean
space itself. Such sets and measures turn out not to be arbitrary, and often
times come with special structure inherited from what they are being
approximated by.
  We will begin by recalling and proving the standard Reifenberg theorem, which
says that sets in Euclidean space which are well approximated by affine
subspaces on all scales must be homoemorphic to balls. These types of results
have applications to studying the regular parts of solutions of nonlinear
equations. The proof given is designed to move cleanly over to more complicated
scenarios introduced later.
  The rest of the lecture notes are designed to introduce and prove the
Rectifiable Reifenberg Theorem, including an introduction to the relevant
concepts. The Rectifiable Reifenberg Theorem roughly says that if a measure
$\mu$ is summably close on all scales to affine subspaces $L^k$, then
$\mu=\mu^++\mu^k$ may be broken into pieces such that $\mu^k$ is
$k$-rectifiable with uniform Hausdorff measure estimates, and $\mu^+$ has
uniform bounds on its mass. These types of results have applications to
studying the singular parts of solutions of nonlinear equations. The proof
given is designed to give a baby introduction to ways of thinking in more
modern PDE analysis, including an introduction to Neck regions and their
Structure Theory.

distinct evolutionary channels lead to the disruption of the less massive WD
during the merger and the formation of a shell burning non-degenerate star
incorporating the ONeMg core. During the shell burning stage a large fraction
of the envelope is lost to the wind, while mass and angular momentum are added
to the core. As a result, the electron-capture collapse occurs with a small
envelope mass, after $\sim 10^2-10^4$ years. During the formation of a neutron
star as little as $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot $ of the material is ejected at the
bounce-off with mildly relativistic velocities and total energy $\sim$ few $
10^{50}$ ergs. This ejecta becomes optically thin on a time scale of days -
this is the FBOT. During the collapse, the neutron star is spun up and magnetic
field is amplified. The ensuing fast magnetically-dominated relativistic wind
from the newly formed neutron star shocks against the ejecta, and later against
the wind. The radiation-dominated forward shock produces the long-lasting
optical afterglow, while the termination shock of the relativistic wind
produces the high energy emission in a manner similar to Pulsar Wind Nebulae.
If the secondary WD was of the DA type, the wind will likely have $\sim 10^{-4}
M_\odot$ of hydrogen; this explains the appearance of hydrogen late in the
afterglow spectrum. The model explains many of the puzzling properties of
FBOTs/AT2018cow: host galaxies, a fast and light anisotropic ejecta producing a
bright optical peak, afterglow high energy emission of similar luminosity to
the optical, and late infra-red features.

nucleosynthesis in similar stellar sites as for their more numerous

discovered in the bulge, at [Fe/H] = $-1.5$ and $-$2.5 dex, both of which show
enhancements in [C/Fe] of 0.4 and 1.4 dex, [Ba/Fe] in excess of 1.3 dex, and
also elevated nitrogen. The more metal-poor of the stars is matched by standard
$s$-process nucleosynthesis in low-mass Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)

investigate the origin of the abundance peculiarities in the Rb-rich star by
new, detailed measurements of heavy element abundances and by comparing the
chemical element ratios of 36 species to models of neutron-capture

those of the $s$- and $r$-processes has been previously found to provide good
matches of CEMP stars with enhancements in both $r$- and $s$-process elements,

$i$-process from a single ingestion event. Instead, it can, statistically, be
better reproduced by models accounting for two proton ingestion events, or by

dimension gets large, the partition function exhibits some of the qualitative
features of an irrational CFT. This, for instance, is captured in the behavior
of the spectral form factor. As part of these analyses, we find similar

  pole",,,"MPP-2018-297","hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we propose a new gravitational setup formulated in terms of two
interacting vierbein fields. The theory is the fully diffeomorphism and local
Lorentz invariant extension of a previous construction which involved a fixed
reference vierbein. Certain vierbein components can be shifted by local Lorentz
transformations and do not enter the associated metric tensors. We parameterize
these components by an antisymmetric tensor field and give them a kinetic term
in the action, thereby promoting them to dynamical variables. In addition, the
action contains two Einstein-Hilbert terms and an interaction potential whose
form is inspired by ghost-free massive gravity and bimetric theory. The
resulting theory describes the interactions of a massless spin-2, a massive
spin-2 and an antisymmetric tensor field. It can be generalized to the case of
multiple massive spin-2 fields and multiple antisymmetric tensor fields. The
absence of additional and potentially pathological degrees of freedom is
verified in an ADM analysis. However, the antisymmetric tensor fluctuation
around the maximally symmetric background solution has a tachyonic mass pole.

therefore expect changing dust grain properties in galaxies which have followed

galaxy helps in reconstructing its evolutionary history. Early-type galaxies
occasionally display regular dust lanes in their central regions. Due to the
relatively simple geometry and composition of their stellar bodies, these
galaxies are ideal to disentangle dust mix variations from geometric effects.
We therefore model the various components of such a galaxy (FCC 167). We
reconstruct its recent history, and investigate the possible fate of the dust
lane. MUSE and ALMA observations reveal a nested ISM structure. An ionised-gas
disk pervades the central regions of FCC 167, including those occupied by the
main dust lane. Inward of the dust lane, we also find a disk/ring of cold
molecular gas where stars are forming and HII regions contribute to the
ionised-gas emission. Further in, the gas ionisation points towards an active
galactic nucleus and the fuelling of a central supermassive black hole from its
surrounding ionised and molecular reservoir. Observational constraints and
radiative transfer models suggest the dust and gas are distributed in a
ring-like geometry and the dust mix lacks small grains. The derived dust
destruction timescales from sputtering in hot gas are short and we conclude
that the dust must be strongly self-shielding and clumpy, or will quickly be
eroded and disappear. Our findings show how detailed analysis of individual

physical apertures. The TNG model returns the observed features of the UVJ

It also returns a tight star-forming main sequence (MS) for $M_*<10^{10.5}\,\rm
M_\odot$ with a $\sim0.3$ dex scatter at $z\sim0$ in our fiducial choices. If a
UVJ-based cut is adopted, the TNG MS exhibits a downwardly bending at stellar
masses of about $10^{10.5-10.7}~\rm M_\odot$. Moreover, the model predicts that
$\sim80\,(50)$ per cent of $10^{10.5-11}~\rm M_\odot$ galaxies at $z=0~(z=2)$
are quiescent and the numbers of quenched galaxies at intermediate redshifts
and high masses are in better agreement with observational estimates than
previous models. However, shorter SFR-averaging timescales imply higher
normalizations and scatter of the MS, while smaller apertures lead to
underestimating the galaxy SFRs: overall we estimate the inspected systematic
uncertainties to sum up to about $0.2-0.3$ dex in the locus of the MS and to
about 15 percentage points in the quenched fractions. While TNG color
distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case for the SFR logarithmic
distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR$\geq 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$).
Finally, the slope and $z=0$ normalization of the TNG MS are consistent with
observational findings; however, the locus of the TNG MS remains lower by about
$0.2-0.5$ dex at $0.75\le z<2$ than the available observational estimates taken

sample of new simulations of the ""Early Instability"" scenario. We use an N-body
integration scheme that accounts for collisional fragmentation, and also
perform a large set of control simulations that do not include an early giant
planet instability. Since the total particle number decreases slower when
collisional fragmentation is accounted for, the growing planets' orbits are
damped more strongly via dynamical friction and encounters with small bodies
that dissipate angular momentum (eg: hit-and-run impacts). Compared with
simulations without collisional fragmentation, our fully evolved systems
provide better matches to the solar system's terrestrial planets in terms of
their compact mass distribution and dynamically cold orbits. Collisional
processes also tend to lengthen the dynamical accretion timescales of Earth
analogs, and shorten those of Mars analogs. This yields systems with relative
growth timescales more consistent with those inferred from isotopic dating.
Accounting for fragmentation is thus supremely important for any successful

(EASs). A space-based or suborbital instrument observing the ground near the
Earth limb can search for the beamed Cherenkov signal produced by the up-going
EAS resulting from the tau-lepton decay. In this paper, we derive the
geometrical constraints for such an observation in general and for the specific
case of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) mission
currently under study, focusing on the Cherenkov signal detection. We show
that, using reasonable orbital parameters, POEMMA can achieve full-sky coverage
to search for potential neutrino sources over the length of its mission. We
also show that follow-up of a transient Target-of-Opportunity (ToO), such as a
flaring source, can be achieved within an orbit time scale depending on the
source location on the celestial sphere and its relative position with respect
to the Sun and the Moon.

on this topic exist all over the globe in the USA, Europe, and Asia. All of
these projects have the overall ambitious goal to increase the well-being of a
vulnerable population. Typical work in RAT is performed using remote controlled
robots; a technique called Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ). The robot is usually controlled,
unbeknownst to the patient, by a human operator. However, WoZ has been
demonstrated to not be a sustainable technique in the long-term. Providing the
robots with autonomy (while remaining under the supervision of the therapist)
has the potential to lighten the therapists burden, not only in the therapeutic
session itself but also in longer-term diagnostic tasks. Therefore, there is a
need for exploring several degrees of autonomy in social robots used in
therapy. Increasing the autonomy of robots might also bring about a new set of
challenges. In particular, there will be a need to answer new ethical questions
regarding the use of robots with a vulnerable population, as well as a need to
ensure ethically-compliant robot behaviours. Therefore, in this workshop we
want to gather findings and explore which degree of autonomy might help to
improve health-care interventions and how we can overcome the ethical

important application, we consider {\it vector functional autoregressive

2009E, and 2009mw. Their photometric and spectroscopic diversity suggest that
there is no prototypical Type II-pec SN. These SNe brighten to maximum faster
than our model set, except perhaps SN2009mw. The spectral evolution of SN1987A
conflicts with other observations and with model predictions from 20d until
maximum: Halpha narrows and weakens while BaII lines strengthen faster than
predicted, which we interpret as signatures of clumping. SN2000cb rises to
maximum in only 20d and shows weak BaII lines. Its spectral evolution is well
matched by an energetic ejecta but the light curve may require asymmetry. The
persistent blue color, narrow lines, and weak Halpha absorption, seen in
SN2006V conflicts with expectations for a BSG explosion powered by 56Ni and may
require an alternative power source. In addition to diversity arising from
different BSG progenitors, we surmise that their ejecta are asymmetric,
clumped, and, in some cases, not solely powered by 56Ni decay [abridged].

functions at the same time has many potential benefits, such as the

namely the ability to generalise to unseen tasks. Parametric generalisation
relies on the interpolation power of a function approximator that is given the
task description as input; one of its most common form are universal value
function approximators (UVFAs). Another way to generalise to new tasks is to
exploit structure in the RL problem itself. Generalised policy improvement
(GPI) combines solutions of previous tasks into a policy for the unseen task;
this relies on instantaneous policy evaluation of old policies under the new

sell excess resource to another community in a prosumer market. In this
chapter, we propose a control theoretic approach to regulate the number of
prosumers in a prosumer community, where each prosumer has a cost function that
is coupled through its time-averaged production and consumption of the
resource. Furthermore, each prosumer runs its distributed algorithm and takes
only binary decisions in a probabilistic way, whether to produce one unit of
the resource or not and to consume one unit of the resource or not. In the
proposed approach, prosumers do not explicitly exchange information with each
other due to privacy reasons, but little exchange of information is required
for feedback signals, broadcast by a central agency. In the proposed approach,
prosumers achieve the optimal values asymptotically. Furthermore, the proposed
approach is suitable to implement in an IoT context with minimal demands on
infrastructure. We describe two use cases; community-based car sharing and
collaborative energy storage for prosumer markets. We also present simulation
results to check the efficacy of the algorithms.

sawtooth potentials, which have frequently been used to model molecular
machines as ratchets. Time asymmetry increases for sawtooth potentials with
higher barriers and for driving potentials of intermediate width. For systems
driven over a sawtooth potential according to a protocol, we find that
symmetric sawtooths maximize time asymmetry, while earlier work examining
ratchet models of molecular machines required asymmetric sawtooth potentials to
achieve directed behavior. This distinction arises because deterministically
driven machines are externally provided with direction, while autonomous

the methods are applicable to the objective functionals of various level of
smoothness: the Lipschitz condition is valid either for the objective
functional itself or for its gradient or Hessian (and the functional may not
satisfy the Lipschitz condition). By using the restart technique methods for
strongly convex minimization problems are proposed. Estimates of the rate of
convergence of the considered algorithms are obtained depending on the level of
smoothness of the objective functional. Numerical experiments illustrating the

that can be run in tandem with the AOT algorithm to recover both the true

only spatially discrete velocity measurements. The algorithm we propose
involves changing the viscosity mid-simulation. Therefore, we also examine the
sensitivity of the equations with respect to the Reynolds number. We prove that
a sequence of difference quotients with respect to the Reynolds number
converges to the unique solution of the sensitivity equations for both the 2D
Navier-Stokes equations and the assimilated equations. We also note that this
appears to be the first such rigorous proof of existence and uniqueness to
strong or weak solutions to the sensitivity equations for the 2D Navier-Stokes

obtained as a limit of difference quotients with respect to the Reynolds

allows us to predict the presence or absence of an additional absorption based

interaction, mediated by a soft boson, destroys fermionic coherence and also
gives rise to superconductivity. In a class of large $N$ models, one would
naively expect an incoherent (non-Fermi liquid) normal state behavior to
persist down to $T=0$. However, this is not the case for quantum-critical
systems described by Eliashberg theory, where non-Fermi liquid part of the
self-energy $\Sigma (\omega_m)$ is large for a generic Matsubara frequency
$\omega_m = \pi T(2m+1)$, but vanishes at $\omega_m = \pm \pi T$, while the
pairing interaction between fermions with these two frequencies remains strong.
This peculiarity gives rise to a non-zero $T_c$ even at large $N$[Y. Wang et al
PRL 117, 157001 (2016)]. We consider the system behavior below $T_c$ and
contrast the two cases when $\omega_m = \pm \pi T$ are either special or not.
We obtain the solution of the non-linear gap equations in real frequency axis
and obtain the spectral function $A(\omega)$ and the density of states
$N(\omega)$. In a conventional BCS-type superconductor $A(\omega)$ and
$N(\omega)$ are peaked at the gap value $\Delta (T)$, and the peak position
shifts to a smaller $\omega$ as temperature increases, i.e. the gap ""closes
in"". However when superconductivity is induced by fermions with $\omega_m = \pm
\pi T$, the peak in $N(\omega)$ remains at a finite frequency even at $T
=T_c-0$, the gap just ""fills in"". The spectral function $A(\omega)$ either
shows almost the same ""gap filling"" behavior, or its peak position shifts to
zero frequency already at a finite $\Delta$ (""emergent Fermi arc"" behavior),
depending on the strength of the thermal contribution. We compare our results
with the data for the cuprates and argue that ""gap filling"" behavior holds in
the antinodal region, while the ""emergent Fermi arc"" behavior holds in the
nodal region.

we suppose that particle-magnetic field and particle-particle interactions are
independent. We consider two configurations for the magnetic field: one where
it constant and externally fixed, and another where it is produced by the
bosons by self-magnetization. Since the magnetic field produces the splitting
of pressures in the directions along and perpendicular to the magnetic axis,
stable configurations of self-magnetized and magnetized BEC stars are studied
using the recently found $\gamma$-structure equations that describe axially
symmetric objects. The magnetized BEC stars are, in general spheroidal, less
massive and smaller than the non-magnetic ones, being these effects more
relevant at low densities. For the self-magnetized BEC stars their inner
profiles of magnetic field can be computed as a function of the equatorial
radii. The values obtained for the core and surface magnetic fields are in
agreement with those typical of compact objects.

complete schema mapping queries in this case requires deep knowledge about the

Sample-driven schema mapping allows the user to describe the schema mapping
using data records. However, real data records are still harder to specify than
other useful insights about the desired schema mapping the user might have. In
this project, we develop a schema mapping system, PRISM, that enables
multiresolution schema mapping. The end user is not limited to providing
high-resolution constraints like exact data records but may also provide
constraints of various resolutions, like incomplete data records, value ranges,
and data types. This new interaction paradigm gives the user more flexibility
in describing the desired schema mapping. This demonstration showcases how to

Convergence, stationarity and disorder are studied in the context of the

distributions of 20 aspects of micro-scale configuration, force and movement
are computed for three topological objects: particles, voids and contacts. The

reversed, order is briefly restored, but continued loading induces greater
disorder in movements and strains until the critical state is reached again.

The problem of joint trajectory design and power control is formulated for
maximizing the instantaneous sum transmit rate while satisfying the rate
requirement of users. In an effort to solve this pertinent problem, a
three-step approach is proposed which is based on machine learning techniques
to obtain both the position information of users and the trajectory design of
UAVs. Firstly, a multi-agent Q-learning based placement algorithm is proposed
for determining the optimal positions of the UAVs based on the initial location
of the users. Secondly, in an effort to determine the mobility information of
users based on a real dataset, their position data is collected from Twitter to
describe the anonymous user-trajectories in the physical world. In the
meantime, an echo state network (ESN) based prediction algorithm is proposed
for predicting the future positions of users based on the real dataset.
Thirdly, a multi-agent Q-learning based algorithm is conceived for predicting
the position of UAVs in each time slot based on the movement of users. In this
algorithm, multiple UAVs act as agents to find optimal actions by interacting
with their environment and learn from their mistakes. Additionally, we also
prove that the proposed multi-agent Q-learning based trajectory design and
power control algorithm can converge under mild conditions. Numerical results
are provided to demonstrate that as the size of the reservoir increases, the
proposed ESN approach improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
that throughput gains of about 17% are achieved.

hot-Jupiters that span effective temperatures from 1350 K to 1750 K, putting

massive (3.15 $M_J$) 1.14 $R_J$, dense ($2.65\pm0.21$ g cm$^{-3}$) hot-Jupiter,

HATS-56b is a short period (4.32-day) highly inflated hot-Jupiter (1.7 $R_J$,
0.6 $M_J$), which is an excellent target for future atmospheric follow-up,

host star. This latter exoplanet has another very interesting feature: the
radial velocities show a significant quadratic trend. If we interpret this
quadratic trend as arising from the pull of an additional planet in the system,
we obtain a period of $P_c = 815^{+253}_{-143}$ days for the possible planet
HATS-56c, and a minimum mass of $M_c\sin i_c = 5.11 \pm 0.94$ $M_J$. The
candidate planet HATS-56c would have a zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of
$T_\textrm{eq}=332\pm 50$ K, and thus would be orbiting close to the habitable

accurately and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can adapt
such models extremely quickly in the face of unexpected changes. Deep neural
network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this
capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a
method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using
deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses
stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation
maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and
maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This
allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated
for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are
encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to
meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is
effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In
this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to
model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is
critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior
methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task

under resonant excitation with and without additional low-power above-band
excitation. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence from a charged exciton (trion)
transition is recorded as the above-band excitation is modulated on and off.
The fluorescence intensity varies as the QD changes from charged to neutral and
back due to the influence of the above-band excitation. We fit the transients
of the time-resolved resonance fluorescence with models that represent the
charging and neutralization processes. The time dependence of the transients
indicate that Auger recombination of resonantly excited trions is largely
responsible for neutralization of the charged state when the above-band
excitation is off. The addition of above-band excitation revives the resonance
fluorescence signal from the trion transition. We conclude that the above-band
laser excites charges that relax into the bound state of the quantum dot via
two different charge transport processes. The captured charges return the QD to
its initial charge state and allow resonant excitation of the trion transition.
The time dependence of one charge transport process is consistent with
ballistic transport of charge carriers excited non-local to the QD via
above-band excitation. We attribute the second charge transport process to
carrier migration through a stochastic collection of weakly-binding sites,
resulting in sub-diffusion-like dynamics.

the presence of ""masks"" is of importance, we introduce the concept of relative
homology.
  The parametric $\chi^2$-test shows differences between observations and
simulations, yielding $p$-values at per-cent to less than per-mil levels
roughly between 2 to 7 degrees. The highest observed deviation for $b_0$ and
$b_1$ is approximately between $3\sigma$-4$\sigma$ at scales of 3 to 7 degrees.
There are reports of mildly unusual behaviour of the Euler characteristic at
3.66 degrees in the literature, computed from independent measurements of the
CMB temperature fluctuations by Planck's predecessor WMAP satellite. The mildly
anomalous behaviour of Euler characteristic is related to the strongly
anomalous behaviour of components and holes. These are also the scales at which
the observed maps exhibit low variance compared to the simulations.
Non-parametric tests show even stronger differences at almost all scales.
Regardless, beyond the trivial possibility that this may still be a
manifestation of an extreme Gaussian case, these observations, along with the
super-horizon scales involved, may motivate to look at primordial
non-Gaussianity. Alternative scenarios worth exploring may be models with
non-trivial topology.

transformation laws that have been reduced to one dimension, that of time. A
goal of the supersymmetry ``genomics'' project is to classify all 4D,
$\mathcal{N}=1$ off-shell supermultiplets in terms of their adinkras.
In~previous works, the genomics project uncovered two fundamental isomer
adinkras, the cis- and trans-adinkras, into which all multiplets investigated
to date can be decomposed. The number of cis- and trans-adinkras describing a
given multiplet define the isomer-equivalence class to which the multiplet
belongs. A further refining classification is that of a supersymmetric
multiplet's holoraumy: the commutator of the supercharges acting on the
representation. The one-dimensionally reduced, matrix representation of a
multiplet's holoraumy defines the multiplet's holoraumy-equivalence class.
Together, a multiplet's isomer-equivalence and holoraumy-equivalence classes
are two of the main characteristics used to distinguish the adinkras associated
with different supersymmetry multiplets in higher dimensions. This paper
focuses on two matter gravitino formulations, each with 20 bosonic and 20
fermionic off-shell degrees of freedom, analyzes them in terms of their isomer-
and holoraumy-equivalence classes, and compares with non-minimal supergravity
which is also a 20x20 multiplet. This analysis fills a missing piece in the
supersymmetry genomics project, as now the isomer-equivalence and
holoraumy-equivalence for representations up to spin two in component fields
have been analyzed for 4D, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. To handle the
calculations of this research effort, we have used the Mathematica software

from read sequencing data is known as haplotype assembly, and consists in
assigning all heterozygous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to exactly
one of the two chromosomes. Indeed, the knowledge of complete haplotypes is
generally more informative than analyzing single SNPs and plays a fundamental
role in many medical applications. To reconstruct the two haplotypes, we
addressed the weighted Minimum Error Correction (wMEC) problem, which is a
successful approach for haplotype assembly. This NP-hard problem consists in
computing the two haplotypes that partition the sequencing reads into two
disjoint sub-sets, with the least number of corrections to the SNP values. To
this aim, we propose here GenHap, a novel computational method for haplotype
assembly based on Genetic Algorithms, yielding optimal solutions by means of a
global search process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach,
we run GenHap on two synthetic (yet realistic) datasets, based on the Roche/454
and PacBio RS II sequencing technologies. We compared the performance of GenHap
against HapCol, an efficient state-of-the-art algorithm for haplotype phasing.
Our results show that GenHap always obtains high accuracy solutions (in terms
of haplotype error rate), and is up to 4x faster than HapCol in the case of
Roche/454 instances and up to 20x faster when compared on the PacBio RS II
dataset. Finally, we assessed the performance of GenHap on two different real
datasets. Future-generation sequencing technologies, producing longer reads
with higher coverage, can highly benefit from GenHap, thanks to its capability
of efficiently solving large instances of the haplotype assembly problem.

of this study is to develop a framework for improving patients' life expectancy
over the LAS based on a comprehensive modeling of the lung transplantation
waiting list. Patients and organs are modeled as arriving according to Poisson
processes, patients' health status evolving a waiting time inhomogeneous Markov
process until death or transplantation, with organ recipient's expected
post-transplant residual life depending on waiting time and health status at
transplantation. Under allocation rules satisfying minimal fairness
requirements, the long-term average expected life converges, and its limit is a
natural standard for comparing allocation strategies. Via the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, upper bounds for the limiting average
expected life are derived as a function of organ availability. Corresponding to
each upper bound is an allocable set of (time, state) pairs at which patients
would be optimally transplanted. The allocable set expands monotonically as
organ availability increases, which motivates the development of an allocation
strategy that leads to long-term expected life close to the upper bound.
Simulation studies are conducted with model parameters estimated from national
lung transplantation data. Results suggest that compared to the LAS, the
proposed allocation strategy could provide a 7.7% increase in average total
life. We further extended the results to the the allocation and matching of

Walking Fish Group (WFG)-based algorithm has a worst-case complexity of
$O(m\cdot 2^n)$ but has a better average performance. These two can be applied
for problems with any $m$. The third CLM-based algorithm is only for $m=3$ and
asymptotically optimal with complexity $\Theta(n\log{n})$. Performance

industrial processes. One of the most fascinating features of biological
channel-facilitated transport is a stochastic gating process, when the channels
dynamically fluctuate between several conformations during the translocation.
Although this phenomenon has been intensively investigated, many properties of
translocation in dynamically changing environment remain not well understood
microscopically. We developed a discrete-state stochastic framework to analyze
the molecular mechanisms of transport processes with stochastic gating by
explicitly calculating molecular fluxes through the pores. Two scenarios are
specifically investigated: 1) symmetry preserving stochastic gating with
free-energy changes, and 2) stochastic gating with symmetry changes but without
modifications in the overall particle-pore interactions. It is found that
stochastic gating can both accelerate or slow down the molecular translocation
depending on the specific parameters of the system. We argue that biological
systems might optimize their performance by utilizing conformational
fluctuations of channels. Our theoretical analysis clarifies physical-chemical
aspects of the molecular mechanisms of transport with stochastic gating.

functions is that they respect the geometry inherent to the space of densities.
Once a metric is specified for this space, the Fr\'echet mean is typically used
to quantify and visualize the average density from the sample. For
one-dimensional densities, the Wasserstein metric is popular due to its
theoretical appeal and interpretive value as an optimal transport metric,
leading to the Wasserstein-Fr\'echet mean or barycenter as the mean density. We
extend the existing methodology for samples of densities in two key directions.
First, motivated by applications in neuroimaging, we consider dependent density
data, where a $p$-vector of univariate random densities is observed for each
sampling unit. Second, we introduce a Wasserstein covariance measure and
propose intuitively appealing estimators for both fixed and diverging $p$,
where the latter corresponds to continuously-indexed densities. We also give
theory demonstrating consistency and asymptotic normality, while accounting for
errors introduced in the unavoidable preparatory density estimation step. The
utility of the Wasserstein covariance matrix is demonstrated through
applications to functional connectivity in the brain using functional magnetic

{\theta}. These queries arise naturally in many applications, such as document
retrieval, image search, and mass spectrometry. The present paper considers the
efficient evaluation of such queries, providing novel optimality guarantees and
exhibiting good performance on real datasets. We take as a starting point
Fagin's well-known Threshold Algorithm (TA), which can be used to answer cosine
threshold queries as follows: an inverted index is first built from the
database vectors during pre-processing; at query time, the algorithm traverses
the index partially to gather a set of candidate vectors to be later verified
for {\theta}-similarity. However, directly applying TA in its raw form misses
significant optimization opportunities. Indeed, we first show that one can take
advantage of the fact that the vectors can be assumed to be normalized, to
obtain an improved, tight stopping condition for index traversal and to
efficiently compute it incrementally. Then we show that one can take advantage
of data skewness to obtain better traversal strategies. In particular, we show
a novel traversal strategy that exploits a common data skewness condition which
holds in multiple domains including mass spectrometry, documents, and image
databases. We show that under the skewness assumption, the new traversal
strategy has a strong, near-optimal performance guarantee. The techniques
developed in the paper are quite general since they can be applied to a large

derived from this processing to create a novel object classifier. That paper,
together with a series of subsequent papers [8, 15, 17, 20, 21, 30, 35], claims
to revolutionize the field by achieving extremely successful results on several
computer-vision tasks, including object classification, transfer learning, and
generation of images depicting human perception and thought using brain-derived
representations measured through EEG. Our novel experiments and analyses
demonstrate that their results crucially depend on the block design that they
use, where all stimuli of a given class are presented together, and fail with a
rapid-event design, where stimuli of different classes are randomly intermixed.
The block design leads to classification of arbitrary brain states based on
block-level temporal correlations that tend to exist in all EEG data, rather
than stimulus-related activity. Because every trial in their test sets comes
from the same block as many trials in the corresponding training sets, their
block design thus leads to surreptitiously training on the test set. This
invalidates all subsequent analyses performed on this data in multiple
published papers and calls into question all of the purported results. We
further show that a novel object classifier constructed with a random codebook
performs as well as or better than a novel object classifier constructed with
the representation extracted from EEG data, suggesting that the performance of
their classifier constructed with a representation extracted from EEG data does
not benefit at all from the brain-derived representation. Our results calibrate
the underlying difficulty of the tasks involved and caution against sensational

peculiar features arising from the interplay among the gravitational
perturbations of the planets in resonance, the evolution of the gas, and its
influence on the dust grains' dynamics. We focus on the 3:2 and 2:1 resonance,
where the trapping may be caused by the convergent migration of a Jupiter- and
Saturn-mass planet, preceding the common gap formation and ensuing outward (or
inward) migration. Models show that a common gap also forms in the dust
component -- similarly to what a single, more massive planet would generate --
and that outward migration leads to a progressive widening of the dust gap and
to a decoupling from the gas gap. As the system evolves, a significantly wider
gap is observed in the dust distribution, which ceases to overlap with the gas
gap in the inner disk regions. At the outer edge of the gas gap, outward
migration of the planets produces an over-density of dust particles, which
evolve differently in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances. For the 3:2, the dust trap at
the gap's outer edge is partly efficient and a significant fraction of the
grains filters through the gap. For the 2:1 resonance, the trap is more
efficient and very few grains cross the gap, while the vast majority accumulate
at the outer edge of the gap.

samples of an object's 2D surfaces. Imperfection in the acquisition process
means that point clouds are often corrupted with noise. Building on recent
advances in graph signal processing, we design local algorithms for 3D point
cloud denoising. Specifically, we design a reweighted graph Laplacian
regularizer (RGLR) for surface normals and demonstrate its merits in rotation
invariance, promotion of piecewise smoothness, and ease of optimization. Using
RGLR as a signal prior, we formulate an optimization problem with a general
lp-norm fidelity term that can explicitly model two types of independent noise:
small but non-sparse noise (using l2 fidelity term) and large but sparser noise
(using l1 fidelity term).
  To establish a linear relationship between normals and 3D point coordinates,
we first perform bipartite graph approximation to divide the point cloud into
two disjoint node sets (red and blue). We then optimize the red and blue nodes'
coordinates alternately. For l2-norm fidelity term, we iteratively solve an
unconstrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, efficiently computed using
conjugate gradient with a bounded condition number to ensure numerical
stability. For l1-norm fidelity term, we iteratively minimize an l1-l2 cost
function sing accelerated proximal gradient (APG), where a good step size is
chosen via Lipschitz continuity analysis. Finally, we propose simple mean and
median filters for flat patches of a given point cloud to estimate the noise
variance given the noise type, which in turn is used to compute a weight
parameter trading off the fidelity term and signal prior in the problem
formulation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art denoising performance

spatial-temporal consistency in video sequences by capturing background

high-quality hard negatives, the block matching algorithm is then applied to
preceding frames to track the associated hard negatives. General negatives are
also introduced in case that there are no hard negatives in the sequence and

promising technique to enable extremely high data rates due to the large
available bandwidth in mmWave frequency bands. In addition, given the knowledge
of an optimal directional beamforming vector, large antenna arrays have been
shown to overcome both the severe signal attenuation in mmWave as well as the
interference problem. However, fundamental limits on achievable learning rate
of an optimal beamforming vector remain.
  This paper considers the problem of adaptive and sequential optimization of
the beamforming vectors during the initial access phase of communication. With
a single-path channel model, the problem is reduced to actively learning the
Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of the signal sent from the user to the Base Station
(BS). Drawing on the recent results in the design of a hierarchical beamforming
codebook [1], sequential measurement dependent noisy search strategies [2], and
active learning from an imperfect labeler [3], an adaptive and sequential
alignment algorithm is proposed.
  An upper bound on the expected search time of the proposed algorithm is
derived via Extrinsic Jensen-Shannon Divergence. which demonstrates that the
search time of the proposed algorithm asymptotically matches the performance of
the noiseless bisection search up to a constant factor. Furthermore, the upper
bound shows that the acquired AoA error probability decays exponentially fast
with the search time with an exponent that is a decreasing function of the
acquisition rate.
  Numerically, the proposed algorithm is compared with prior work where a
significant improvement of the system communication rate is observed. Most
notably, in the relevant regime of low (-10dB to 5dB) raw SNR, this establishes
the first practically viable solution for initial access and, hence, the first
demonstration of stand-alone mmWave communication

One of the challenges of integrating DPM with DVFS and task scheduling of

- the choice of intensities and probabilities of sending them - is a crucial
step in gaining optimal performance, especially when one realistically
considers finite communication time. With the increasing interest in the field
to implement QKD over free-space on moving platforms, such as drones, handheld
systems, and even satellites, one needs to perform parameter optimization with
low latency and with very limited computing power. Moreover, with the advent of
the Internet of Things (IoT), a highly attractive direction of QKD could be a
quantum network with multiple devices and numerous connections, which provides
a huge computational challenge for the controller that optimizes parameters for
a large-scale network. Traditionally, such an optimization relies on
brute-force search, or local search algorithms, which are computationally
intensive, and will be slow on low-power platforms (which increases latency in
the system) or infeasible for even moderately large networks. In this work we
present a new method that uses a neural network to directly predict the optimal
parameters for QKD systems. We test our machine learning algorithm on hardware
devices including a Raspberry Pi 3 single-board-computer (similar devices are
commonly used on drones) and a mobile phone, both of which have a power
consumption of less than 5 watts, and we find a speedup of up to 100-1000 times
when compared to standard local search algorithms. The predicted parameters are
highly accurate and can preserve over 95-99% of the optimal secure key rate.
Moreover, our approach is highly general and not limited to any specific QKD

  Non-Convex Optimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.NA math.PR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Langevin dynamics (LD) has been proven to be a powerful technique for
optimizing a non-convex objective as an efficient algorithm to find local
minima while eventually visiting a global minimum on longer time-scales. LD is
based on the first-order Langevin diffusion which is reversible in time. We
study two variants that are based on non-reversible Langevin diffusions: the
underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) and the Langevin dynamics with a
non-symmetric drift (NLD). Adopting the techniques of Tzen, Liang and Raginsky
(2018) for LD to non-reversible diffusions, we show that for a given local
minimum that is within an arbitrary distance from the initialization, with high
probability, either the ULD trajectory ends up somewhere outside a small
neighborhood of this local minimum within a recurrence time which depends on
the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the local minimum or they enter this
neighborhood by the recurrence time and stay there for a potentially
exponentially long escape time. The ULD algorithms improve upon the recurrence
time obtained for LD in Tzen, Liang and Raginsky (2018) with respect to the
dependency on the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the local minimum.
Similar result and improvement are obtained for the NLD algorithm. We also show
that non-reversible variants can exit the basin of attraction of a local
minimum faster in discrete time when the objective has two local minima
separated by a saddle point and quantify the amount of improvement. Our
analysis suggests that non-reversible Langevin algorithms are more efficient to
locate a local minimum as well as exploring the state space. Our analysis is
based on the quadratic approximation of the objective around a local minimum.
As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain optimal mixing rates for quadratic
objectives in the 2-Wasserstein distance for two non-reversible Langevin
algorithms we consider.

perform statistical inference on the distribution parameters of the process.
Under complete observation of the sample paths, maximum likelihood estimates

Estimation under incomplete observation is performed using the EM algorithm.
The estimation results completely characterize the process in terms of the

intensity matrices of the underlying Markov jump processes, and the switching
probability matrix of the process. Some numerical examples are given to test

expensive finite element (FE) models of the brain to create tissue deformation
metrics of brain injury. Here, we developed a 3 degree-of-freedom
lumped-parameter brain model, built based on the measured natural frequencies
of a FE brain model simulated with live human impact data, to be used to
rapidly estimate peak brain strains experienced during head rotational
accelerations. On our dataset, the simplified model correlates with peak
principal FE strain by an R2 of 0.80. Further, coronal and axial model
displacement correlated with fiber-oriented peak strain in the corpus callosum
with an R2 of 0.77. Using the maximum displacement predicted by our brain
model, we propose an injury criteria and compare it against a number of
existing rotational and translational kinematic injury metrics on a dataset of
head kinematics from 27 clinically diagnosed injuries and 887 non-injuries. We
found that our proposed metric performed comparably to peak angular
acceleration, linear acceleration, and angular velocity in classifying injury
and non-injury events. Metrics which separated time traces into their
directional components had improved deviance to those which combined components
into a single time trace magnitude. Our brain model can be used in future work

crossing demands they lie on a plane X. The conformal bootstrap is then
geometrically interpreted as demanding a non-empty intersection of U and X. We
find that the conformal blocks enjoy a surprising positive determinant
property. This implies that U is an example of a famous polytope -- the cyclic

completion to generate plausible facial structures. These methods, however, are
limited in maintaining global consistency among face components and recovering
fine facial details. On the other hand, reflectional symmetry is a prominent
property of face image and benefits face recognition and consistency modeling,
yet remaining uninvestigated in deep face completion. In this work, we leverage
two kinds of symmetry-enforcing subnets to form a symmetry-consistent CNN model
(i.e., SymmFCNet) for effective face completion. For missing pixels on only one
of the half-faces, an illumination-reweighted warping subnet is developed to
guide the warping and illumination reweighting of the other half-face. As for
missing pixels on both of half-faces, we present a generative reconstruction
subnet together with a perceptual symmetry loss to enforce symmetry consistency
of recovered structures. The SymmFCNet is constructed by stacking generative
reconstruction subnet upon illumination-reweighted warping subnet, and can be
end-to-end learned from training set of unaligned face images. Experiments show
that SymmFCNet can generate high quality results on images with synthetic and
real occlusion, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.

emerging and interesting problem in micro-expression analysis. CDMER is more
challenging than the conventional micro-expression recognition (MER), because
the training and testing samples in CDMER come from different micro-expression
databases, resulting in the inconsistency of the feature distributions between
the training and testing sets. In this paper, we contribute to this topic from
three aspects. First, we establish a CDMER experimental evaluation protocol
aiming to allow the researchers to conveniently work on this topic and provide
a standard platform for evaluating their proposed methods. Second, we conduct
benchmark experiments by using NINE state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA)
methods and SIX popular spatiotemporal descriptors for respectively
investigating CDMER problem from two different perspectives. Third, we propose
a novel DA method called region selective transfer regression (RSTR) to deal
with the CDMER task. Our RSTR takes advantage of one important cue for
recognizing micro-expressions, i.e., the different contributions of the facial
local regions in MER. The overall superior performance of RSTR demonstrates
that taking into consideration the important cues benefiting MER, e.g., the
facial local region information, contributes to develop effective DA methods
for dealing with CDMER problem.

these gas rich galaxies are believed to have recently collided head-on, the
pair exhibits a surprisingly normal total (sub-LIRG) IR luminosity
($\mathrm{L_{FIR} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{10}}$ L$_\odot$). Previous observations
have demonstrated that a large quantity of molecular and neutral gas have been
drawn out of the galaxies into a massive multi-phase bridge. We present, for
the first time, spatially resolved spectroscopy of the ionized gas in the
system. The results show that the ionized gas is highly disturbed
kinematically, with gas spread in two main filaments between the two galaxies.
The line profiles exhibit widespread double components in both the bridge and
parts of the disks of the galaxies. We investigate the spatial distribution of
the excitation properties of the ionized gas using emission-line diagnostic
diagrams, and conclude that large quantities (up to 40$\%$) of the emission
from the entire system is consistent with gas heated in $\sim$200 \kms\ shocks.
While the shocked gas is mainly associated with the bridge, there is a
significant amount of shocked gas associated with both galaxies. Confirming
other multi-wavelength indicators, the results suggest that the effects of
shocks and turbulence can continue to be felt in a high-speed galaxy collision
long after the collision has occurred. The persistence of shocks in the Taffy
system may explain the relatively low current star formation rates in the

the problem of determining the minimum number of sensors whose removal can
destroy system observability, as well as the problem of determining the minimum
number of state variables that need to be prevented from being directly
measured by the existing sensors to destroy observability, is investigated. The
first one is closely related to the ability of unique state reconstruction of a
system under adversarial sensor attacks, and the dual of both problems are in
the opposite direction of the well-studied minimal controllability problems. It
is proven that all these problems are NP-hard, both for a numerical system and
a structured system, even restricted to some special cases. It is also shown
that the first problems both for a numerical system and a structured one share
a cardinality-constrained submodular minimization structure, for which there is
no known constant or logarithmic factor approximation in general. On the other
hand, for the first two problems, under a reasonable assumption often met by
practical systems, that the eigenvalue geometric multiplicities of the
numerical systems or the matching deficiencies of the structured systems are
bounded by a constant, by levering the rank-one update property of the involved
rank function, it is possible to obtain the corresponding optimal solutions by
traversing a subset of the feasible solutions. We show such a method has
polynomial time complexity in the system dimensions and the number of sensors.

in the geomechanics literature, a critical state condition is reached after

at the critical state, the stress, fabric, and density remain nearly constant,
even as particles are being continually rearranged. The paper proposes a
predictive framework for critical state flow, viewing it as a condition of
maximum disorder at the micro-scale. The flow model is constructed in a
two-dimensional setting from the probability density of the motions, forces,
and orientations of inter-particle contacts. Constraints are applied to this
probability density: constant mean stress, constant volume, consistency of the
contact dissipation rate with the stress work, and the fraction of sliding
contacts. The differential form of Shannon entropy, a measure of disorder, is
applied to the density, and the Jaynes formalism is used to find the density of
maximum disorder in the underlying phase space. The resulting distributions of
contact force, movement, and orientation are compared with two-dimensional DEM
simulations of biaxial compression. The model favorably predicts anisotropies
of the contact orientations, contact forces, contact movements, and the
orientations of those contacts undergoing slip. The model also predicts the
relationships between contact force magnitude and contact motion. The model is
an alternative to affine-field descriptions of granular flow.

originality score, retention coefficients, production coefficients,
inter-copying time, duration of sharing and speed coefficients. We further

proportionality between $m$ and $n$ with dimension-independent constant ensures
stability of the cubature formula with high probability. We also prove error
estimates in probability and in expectation for any $n\geq 1$ and $m>n$, thus
covering both preasymptotic and asymptotic regimes. Our analysis shows that the
expected cubature error decays as $\sqrt{n/m}$ times the $L(\Gamma, \mu)$-best
approximation error of $\phi$ in $V_n$. On the one hand, for fixed $n$ and
$m\to \infty$ our cubature formula can be seen as a variance reduction
technique for a Monte Carlo estimator, and can lead to enormous variance
reduction for smooth integrand functions and subspaces $V_n$ with spectral
approximation properties. On the other hand, when we let $n,m\to\infty$, our
cubature becomes of high order with spectral convergence. As a further
contribution, we analyse also another cubature formula whose expected error
decays as $\sqrt{1/m}$ times the $L^2(\Gamma,\mu)$-best approximation error of
$\phi$ in $V_n$, which is asymptotically optimal but with constants that can be
larger in the preasymptotic regime. Finally we show that, under a more
demanding (at least quadratic) proportionality betweeen $m$ and $n$, the
weights of the cubature are positive with high probability.

Unfortunately the sensing `coverage' is limited by environmental obstructions,

adopt collaborative sensing amongst vehicles possibly assisted by
infrastructure. This paper introduces new models and performance analysis for
vehicular collaborative sensing and networking. In particular, coverage gains
are quantified, as are their dependence on the penetration of vehicles
participating in collaborative sensing. We also evaluate the associated
communication loads in terms of the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) capacity requirements and how these depend on
penetration. We further explore how collaboration with sensing capable
infrastructure improves sensing performance, as well as the benefits in
utilizing spatio-temporal dynamics, e.g., collaborating with vehicles moving in
the opposite direction. Collaborative sensing is shown to greatly improve
sensing performance, e.g., improves coverage from 20% to 80% with a 20%
penetration. In scenarios with limited penetration and high coverage
requirements, infrastructure can be used to both help sense the environment and
relay data. Once penetration is high enough, sensing vehicles provide good
coverage and data traffic can be effectively `offloaded' to V2V connectivity,
making V2I resources available to support other in-car services.

mobile terminal (also called terminal user) that is distributed on network edge
and communicates edge clouds with wireless. Generally, there are multiple edge
cloud nodes with distinct processing capability in a geographic area, which can
offer computing service for various terminal users. Furthermore, the terminal
users are competitive and selfish, i.e., each user takes into account only
maximizing her own profit, while conducting task offloading strategies. In this
paper, we focus on the resource management optimization for edge clouds, and
formulate the problem of resource competition among terminal users as a
non-cooperative game, in which the terminal user who acts as the player always
pursues the minimization of the expected response time for her tasks by
optimizing allocation strategies. We present the utility function of the user
with queuing theory, and then prove the existence of Nash equilibrium for the
formulated game. Using the concept of Nash bargaining solution to calculate the
optimal task offloading scheme for the user, we propose a distributed task
offloading algorithm with low computation complexity. The results of simulated
experiments demonstrate that our method can quickly reach the Nash equilibrium
point, and deliver satisfying performance at the expected response time of the
user's tasks.

(DP-AFD) algorithm is proposed for fault diagnosis in distributed systems with
arbitrary topology. Faulty nodes may be either unresponsive, may have either
software or hardware faults. The proposed algorithm detects the faulty nodes
situated in geographically distributed locations. This algorithm does not
depend on a single node or leader to detect the faults in the system. However,
it empowers more than one node to detect the fault-free and faulty nodes in the
system. Thus, at the end of each test cycle, every fault-free node acts as a
leader to diagnose faults in the system. This feature of the algorithm makes it
applicable to any arbitrary network. After every test cycle of the algorithm,
all the nodes have knowledge about faulty nodes and each node is tested only
once. With this knowledge, there can be redistribution of load, which was
earlier assigned to the faulty nodes. Also, the algorithm permits repaired node
re-entry and new node entry. In a system of n nodes, the maximum number of
faulty nodes can be (n-1) which is detected by DP-AFD algorithm. DP-AFD is
periodic in nature which executes test cycles after regular intervals to detect
the faulty nodes in the given distributed system.

while its quick and accurate measurement is still a challenge. Here we proposed
two methods for shear modulus measurement based on torsional resonance and
torsional wave propagation using a same piezoelectric torsional transducer.
Firstly, the torsional transducer was introduced which consists of two
thickness poled, thickness shear (d15) piezoelectric half-rings. Secondly, the
equivalent circuit of the transducer-cylindrical specimen system is derived and
the shear modulus can be explicitly obtained using the torsional resonance
frequency. The internal friction can also be obtained, which is calculated by
using an approximate formula. Then, the principle of shear modulus and internal
friction measurement based on torsional wave propagation were presented.
Finally, shear modulus and internal friction measurement on four materials
including 1045 steel, aluminum, quartz glass and PMMA, were conducted. Results
indicate that the measured shear moduli using these two methods are very close
to each other, and consistent with the reference values in literatures. The
resonance method is quite convenient and highly repeatable, but is typically
not suitable for long specimens where the first torsional resonance may not be
visible. The wave propagation method is especially suitable for long specimens
and high frequency measurement is suggested. The internal frictions measured by
these two methods were also close to each other, and the simple wave
attenuation method is suggested. The two shear modulus measurement methods
proposed in this work are quite reliable and can be widely used in near future.

gravitational field, verifying the effect of the charge term of the metric on
the oscillations. The expression for temperature oscillations follows from
Tolman's law written in Fermi normal coordinates for a comoving observer. The
motion of the gas is close to geodesic so the equation of geodesic deviation
was used to obtain the expression for temperature oscillations. Then these
oscillations are calculated for some compact stars, quark stars, black holes
and white dwarfs, using values of electric charge and mass from models found in
the literature. Comparing the various models analyzed, it is possible to verify
that the role of the charge is the opposite of the mass. While the increase of
the mass produces a reduction in the frequencies, amplitude and in the ratio
between the frequencies, the increase of the electric charge produces the
inverse effect. In addition, it is shown that if the electric charge is
proportional to the mass, the ratio between the frequencies does not depend on
the mass, but only on the proportionality factor between charge and mass. The
ratios between the frequencies for all the models analyzed (except for
supermassive black holes in the extreme limit situations) are close to the
$3/2$ ratio for twin peak quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, observed in
many galactic black holes and neutron star sources in low-mass X-ray binaries.

techniques to solve, even though the game is simple enough that any human
player could learn and master it within a short time. In this paper we analyse
how hard the problem really is, presenting several proofs for the computational
complexity of Angry Birds. By using a combination of several gadgets within
this game's environment, we are able to demonstrate that the decision problem
of solving general levels for different versions of Angry Birds is either
NP-hard, PSPACE-hard, PSPACE-complete or EXPTIME-hard. Proof of NP-hardness is
by reduction from 3-SAT, whilst proof of PSPACE-hardness is by reduction from
True Quantified Boolean Formula (TQBF). Proof of EXPTIME-hardness is by
reduction from G2, a known EXPTIME-complete problem similar to that used for
many previous games such as Chess, Go and Checkers. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that a single-player game has been proven
EXPTIME-hard. This is achieved by using stochastic game engine dynamics to
effectively model the real world, or in our case the physics simulator, as the
opponent against which we are playing. These proofs can also be extended to
other physics-based games with similar mechanics.

REE+Y (rare earth elements and Y) and HFSE (high field strength elements) is a
key requirement for modelling petrological and volcanological aspects of magma
dynamics. In this context, mafic alkaline magmas (MAM) are characterized by the
ubiquitous stability of clinopyroxene from mantle depths to shallow crustal
levels. On one hand, clinopyroxene incorporates REE+Y/HFSE at concentration
levels that are much higher than those measured for olivine, plagioclase, and
magnetite. On the other hand, the composition of clinopyroxene is highly
sensitive to variations in pressure, temperature, and melt-water content,
according to exchange-equilibria between jadeite and melt, and between
jadeite/Ca-Tschermak and diopside-hedenbergite. As a consequence, the
dependence of the partition coefficient on the physicochemical state of the
system results in a variety of DREE+Y/DHFSE values that are sensitive to the
magmatic conditions at which clinopyroxenes nucleate and grow. In order to
better explore magma dynamics using clinopyroxene, a new P-T-H2O-lattice strain
model specific to MAM compositions has been developed. The model combines a set
of refined clinopyroxene-based barometric, thermometric and hygrometric
equations with thermodynamically-derived expressions for the three lattice
strain parameters, i.e., the strain-free partition coefficient (D0), the site

collect high resolution observations, these observations represent more
patterns of detailed processes that are not part of a modeling purpose. This
mismatch results in model discrepancies, i.e. systematic differences between
observations and model predictions. When discrepancies are not accounted for
properly, posterior uncertainty is underestimated. Furthermore parameters are
inferred so that model discrepancies appear with observation data stream with
few records instead of data streams corresponding to the weak model parts. This
impedes the identification of weak process formulations that need to be
improved. Therefore, we developed an efficient formulation to account for model
discrepancy by the statistical model of Gaussian processes (GP). This paper
presents a new Bayesian sampling scheme for model parameters and discrepancies,
explains the effects of its application on inference by a basic example, and
demonstrates applicability to a real world model-data integration study.
  The GP approach correctly identified model discrepancy in rich data streams.
Innovations in sampling allowed successful application to observation data
streams of several thousand records. Moreover, the proposed new formulation
could be combined with gradient-based optimization. As a consequence, model
inversion studies should acknowledge model discrepancies, especially when using
multiple imbalanced data streams. To this end, studies can use the proposed GP
approach to improve inference on model parameters and modeled processes.

maximal ideal generated by $\pi$. Let $\Lambda$ be an $R$-order such that
$Q\Lambda$ is a separable $Q$-algebra. Maranda showed that there exists
$k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $\Lambda$-lattices $L$ and $M$, if
$L/L\pi^k\simeq M/M\pi^k$ then $L\simeq M$. Moreover, if $R$ is complete and
$L$ is an indecomposable $\Lambda$-lattice, then $L/L\pi^k$ is also
indecomposable. We extend Maranda's theorem to the class of $R$-reduced
$R$-torsion-free pure-injective $\Lambda$-modules.
  As an application of this extension, we show that if $\Lambda$ is an order
over a Dedekind domain $R$ with field of fractions $Q$ such that $Q\Lambda$ is
separable then the lattice of open subsets of the $R$-torsion-free part of the
right Ziegler spectrum of $\Lambda$ is isomorphic to the lattice of open
subsets of the $R$-torsion-free part of the left Ziegler spectrum of $\Lambda$.
  Finally, with $k$ as in Maranda's theorem, we show that if $M$ is
$R$-torsion-free and $H(M)$ is the pure-injective hull of $M$ then
$H(M)/H(M)\pi^k$ is the pure-injective hull of $M/M\pi^k$. We use this result
to give a characterisation of $R$-torsion-free pure-injective $\Lambda$-modules
and describe the pure-injective hulls of certain $R$-torsion-free
$\Lambda$-modules.

compare the derived word sentiments against a public sentiment resource

sentiment expressed from the language, visual, and acoustic modalities. The
central challenge in multimodal learning involves inferring joint
representations that can process and relate information from these modalities.
However, existing work learns joint representations by requiring all modalities
as input and as a result, the learned representations may be sensitive to noisy
or missing modalities at test time. With the recent success of sequence to
sequence (Seq2Seq) models in machine translation, there is an opportunity to
explore new ways of learning joint representations that may not require all
input modalities at test time. In this paper, we propose a method to learn
robust joint representations by translating between modalities. Our method is
based on the key insight that translation from a source to a target modality
provides a method of learning joint representations using only the source
modality as input. We augment modality translations with a cycle consistency
loss to ensure that our joint representations retain maximal information from
all modalities. Once our translation model is trained with paired multimodal
data, we only need data from the source modality at test time for final
sentiment prediction. This ensures that our model remains robust from
perturbations or missing information in the other modalities. We train our
model with a coupled translation-prediction objective and it achieves new
state-of-the-art results on multimodal sentiment analysis datasets: CMU-MOSI,
ICT-MMMO, and YouTube. Additional experiments show that our model learns
increasingly discriminative joint representations with more input modalities
while maintaining robustness to missing or perturbed modalities.

are visible in the field of view of IFS (\sim 100 au centered on the star) or
in the IRDIS field of view (\sim 400 au centered on the star). Measurements
from IFS, SAM IFS, and IRDIS suggest an M6 spectral type for HD142527B, with an
uncertainty of one spectral subtype, compatible with an object of M=0.11 \pm
0.06 MSun and R=0.15 \pm 0.07 RSun. The determination of the mass remains a
challenge using contemporary evolutionary models, as they do not account for
the energy input due to accretion from infalling material. We consider that the
spectral type of the secondary may also be earlier than the type we derived
from IFS spectra. From dynamical considerations, we further constrain the mass
to 0.26^{+0.16}_{-0.14} MSun , which is consistent with both our spectroscopic
analysis and the values reported in the literature. Following previous methods,
the lower and upper dynamical mass values correspond to a spectral type between
M2.5 and M5.5 for the companion. By fitting the astrometric points, we find the
following orbital parameters: a period of P=35-137 yr; an inclination of
i=121-130 deg.; , a value of Omega=124-135 deg for the longitude of node, and
an 68% confidence interval of \sim 18 - 57 au for the separation at periapsis.

the warm molecular gas in the CSEs of a sample of bright carbon-rich stars
spanning different evolutionary stages from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
to the young planetary nebulae (PNe) phase. We use the rotational diagram (RD)
to derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) and masses ($M_{\rm H_2}$) of
the envelope layers where the CO transitions arise. We also obtain a first
order estimate of the mass-loss rates and assess the impact of the opacity
correction for a range of characteristic envelope radii. We use multi-epoch
spectra for the well studied C-rich envelope IRC+10216 to investigate the
impact of CO flux variability on the values of $T_{\rm rot}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}$.
PACS sensitivity allowed the study of higher rotational numbers than before,
indicating the presence of a significant amount of warmer gas ($\sim$200-900 K)
not traceable with lower-$J$ CO observations at sub-mm/mm wavelengths. The
masses are in the range $\sim10^{-2}-10^{-5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, anti-correlated
with temperature. For some strong CO emitters we infer a double temperature
(warm $T_{\rm rot}\sim$400 K and hot $T_{\rm rot}\sim$820 K) component. From
the analysis of IRC+10216, we corroborate that the effect of line variability
is perceptible on the $T_{\rm rot}$ of the hot component only, and certainly
insignificant on $M_{\rm H_2}$ and, hence, the mass-loss rate. Therefore, the
parameters derived from the RD are robust even when strong line flux
variability occurs, with the major source of uncertainty in the estimate of the
mass-loss rate being the size of the CO-emitting volume.

because they are trained with high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images.
Graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely used to accelerate the trainings.
However, the memory on a GPU is not large enough to train the models. A popular
approach to tackling this problem is patch-based method, which divides a large
image into small patches and trains the models with these small patches.
However, this method would degrade the segmentation quality if a target object
spans multiple patches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for 3D
medical image segmentation that utilizes the data-swapping, which swaps out
intermediate data from GPU memory to CPU memory to enlarge the effective GPU
memory size, for training high-resolution 3D medical images without patching.
We carefully tuned parameters in the data-swapping method to obtain the best
training performance for 3D U-Net, a widely used deep neural network model for
medical image segmentation. We applied our tuning to train 3D U-Net with
full-size images of 192 x 192 x 192 voxels in brain tumor dataset. As a result,
communication overhead, which is the most important issue, was reduced by
17.1%. Compared with the patch-based method for patches of 128 x 128 x 128

score by 4.48% and 5.32 % for detecting whole tumor sub-region and tumor core
sub-region, respectively. The total training time was reduced from 164 hours to
47 hours, resulting in 3.53 times of acceleration.

Electron-Ion Monte Carlo (CEIMC). At fixed density and temperature, we find
that pressure from vdW is higher than pressure from CEIMC by about 10 GPa in
the molecular insulating phase and about 20 GPa in the dissociated metallic
phase. Molecules are found to be overstabilized using vdW, with a slightly
shorter bond length, and with a stronger resistance to compression. As a
consequence, pressure dissociation along isotherms using vdW is more
progressive than computed with CEIMC. Below the critical point, the
liquid-liquid phase transition is observed with both theories in the same
density region but the one predicted by vdW has a smaller density
discontinuity, i.e. a smaller first order character. The optical conductivity
computed using Kubo-Greenwood is rather similar for the two systems and
reflects the slightly more pronounced molecular character of vdW.

Workshop on Physics at HL-LHC, and perspectives on HE-LHC [2]. It is devoted to
the study of the potential, in the search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
physics, of the High Luminosity (HL) phase of the LHC, defined as
$3~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ of data taken at a centre-of-mass energy of
$14~\mathrm{TeV}$, and of a possible future upgrade, the High Energy (HE) LHC,
defined as $15~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ of data at a centre-of-mass energy of
$27~\mathrm{TeV}$. We consider a large variety of new physics models, both in a
simplified model fashion and in a more model-dependent one. A long list of
contributions from the theory and experimental (ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) communities
have been collected and merged together to give a complete, wide, and
consistent view of future prospects for BSM physics at the considered
colliders. On top of the usual standard candles, such as supersymmetric
simplified models and resonances, considered for the evaluation of future
collider potentials, this report contains results on dark matter and dark
sectors, long lived particles, leptoquarks, sterile neutrinos, axion-like
particles, heavy scalars, vector-like quarks, and more. Particular attention is
placed, especially in the study of the HL-LHC prospects, to the detector
upgrades, the assessment of the future systematic uncertainties, and new
experimental techniques. The general conclusion is that the HL-LHC, on top of
allowing to extend the present LHC mass and coupling reach by $20-50\%$ on most
new physics scenarios, will also be able to constrain, and potentially
discover, new physics that is presently unconstrained. Moreover, compared to
the HL-LHC, the reach in most observables will generally more than double at
the HE-LHC, which may represent a good candidate future facility for a final
test of TeV-scale new physics.

baryon chiral perturbation theory with the extended-on-mass-shell
renormalization scheme. The pertinent low energy constants $g_{1-4}$ are fixed
with the help of the quark model and the heavy quark spin flavor symmetry,
while the remaining $d_2$, $d_3$, $d_5$ and $d_6$ are determined by fitting to
the lattice QCD pion-mass dependent data. We study the magnetic moments as a
function of $m_\pi^2$ and compare our results with those obtained in the heavy
baryon chiral perturbation theory. We find that the loop corrections induced by
the anti-triplet states are dominated by the baryon pole diagram. In addition,
we predict the magnetic moments of the spin-1/2 singly charmed baryons and
compare them with those of other approaches.

the superconducting topological insulators M$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ (M

two-dimensional representation of the $D_{3d}$ symmetry group of the crystal.
Motivated by these progresses, we construct an exhaustive list of possible
two-component pairings of the M$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ superconductors, both for
the odd-parity $E_{u}$ representation and for the even-parity $E_{g}$
representation. Starting from a tight-binding model for the normal phase of
Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and M$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, we firstly construct the pairing
channels in the spin-orbital basis, up to second-nearest-neighbor pairing
correlations in the basal plane. We then infer the properties of these pairings
by transforming them to the band (pseudospin) basis for the conduction band. A
comparison with the key experimental consensuses on M$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$
superconductors shows that the true pairings should also be multichannel.
Besides a nematic and time-reversal symmetric pairing combination, the other
pairings that we have identified are chiral and nematic at the same time, which
may be nonunitary and have a spontaneous magnetization. A complementary set of
experiments are proposed to identify the true pairing symmetries of these
superconductors and their evolution with the doping concentration $x$.

to its global X-ray surface brightness taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
The X-ray residual image after removing the global emission of the intracluster
medium (ICM), however, shows an arc-like positive excess and a negative excess
surrounding the central positive excess in the cluster core, which in turn
indicates a disturbance of the ICM. We analyze the X-ray spectra extracted from
both regions and find that (1) the ICM temperature and the metal abundance in
the positive excess are lower and higher than those in the negative excess,
respectively, and (2) the ICM is nearly in pressure equilibrium. We also find a
slight redshift difference between the positive and the negative excesses,
which corresponds to the velocity shear of $1680^{+1300}_{-920}$ km s$^{-1}$
($1\sigma$). The X-ray residual image and the ICM properties are consistent
with those expected by line-of-sight gas sloshing. Assuming that the gas is
moving toward inverse-parallel to each other along the line-of-sight, the shear
velocity is expected to be $\sim 800$ km s$^{-1}$. The velocity field of this
level is able to provide non-thermal pressure support by $\sim 34\%$ relative
to the thermal one. The total kinetic energy inferred from the shear velocity
corresponds to $\sim 30\%$ of the bolometric luminosity of the sloshing ICM.
Abell 907 is therefore complementary to galaxy clusters in which gas sloshing
takes place in the plane of the sky, and is important for understanding gas
dynamics driven by sloshing and its influence on the heating to prevent runaway
cooling.

lightest and as such the most quantum of the elements, in the sense that
quantum tunnelling, quantum delocalisation, and zero-point motion can be
important. For practical reasons most computer simulations of materials have
not taken such effects into account, rather they have treated atomic nuclei as
classical point-like particles. However, it is an exciting time for the theory
and simulation of materials and thanks to significant methodological
developments over the last few decades, nuclear quantum effects can now be
accurately treated in complex materials. In this brief review we discuss our
recent studies on the role nuclear quantum effects play in hydrogen containing
systems. We give examples of how the quantum nature of the nuclei has a
significant impact on the location of the boundaries between phases in high
pressure condensed hydrogen, including a dramatic lowering of the solid to
liquid melting line. We show how nuclear quantum effects facilitate the
dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen on solid surfaces and the
diffusion of atomic hydrogen across surfaces; effects that are of relevance to
the catalytic performance of the surfaces. Finally, we discuss how nuclear
quantum effects alter the strength and structure of hydrogen bonds, including
the hydrogen bonds in DNA. Overall these studies demonstrate that nuclear
quantum effects can manifest in many different, interesting, and at times
non-intuitive ways. Whilst historically it has been difficult to know in
advance what influence nuclear quantum effects will have, some of the important
conceptual foundations have now started to emerge.

supported by a combination of material, device, and system innovations. To this
end, bifacial solar farms are expected to decrease LCOE further by increasing
the energy yield; but given the rapid pace of design/manufacturing innovations,
a cost-inclusive optimization of bifacial solar farms has not been reported. In
our worldwide study, we use a fundamentally new approach to decouple energy
yield from cost considerations by parameterizing the LCOE formula in terms of
""land-cost"" and ""module cost"" to show that an interplay of these parameters
defines the optimum design of bifacial farms. For ground-mounted solar panels,
we observe that the panels must be oriented horizontally and packed densely for
locations with high ""land-cost"", whereas the panels should be optimally tilted
for places with high ""module-cost"". Compared to a monofacial farm, the modules
in an optimized bifacial farm must be tilted ~15-20 degrees higher and will
reduce LCOE by ~8-10% in many locations of the world. The results in this paper
will guide the deployment of LCOE-minimized ground-mounted tilted bifacial

specificities. In spite of the generally better performance of men, it can not
be ignored that there are a significant number of scientific sectors in which
the performance of women does not result as inferior.

of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, several users are grouped
together for NOMA transmission while orthogonal resources are allocated among
groups. User grouping strategies have significant impact on the power
consumption and system performance. However, existing related studies divide
users into groups based on channel conditions, where diverse quality of service
(QoS) and interference have not been considered. In this paper, we focus on the
interference-aware user grouping strategy in NOMA systems, aiming at minimizing
power consumption with QoS constraints. We define a power consumption and
externality (PCE) function for each user to represent the power consumption
involved by this user to satisfy its QoS requirement as well as interference
that this user brings to others in the same group. Then, we extend the
definition of PCE to multi-user scenarios and convert the user grouping problem
into the problem of searching for specific negative loops in the graph.
Bellman-Ford algorithm is extended to find these negative loops. Furthermore, a
greedy suboptimal algorithm is proposed to approach the solution within
polynomial time. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can
considerably reduce the total power consumption compared with existing
strategies.

machine learning (ML) solutions for IRLV. We first show that solutions based on
either neural networks (NNs) or support vector machines (SVMs) and typical loss

sufficiently complex learning machines and large training datasets . Indeed,
for finite training, ML solutions are more accurate than the N-P test based on
estimated channel statistics. Then, as estimating channel features outside the

NNs and one-class SVMs, which however are not equivalent to the generalized

express the user's need for results. We fundamentally redefine what a query
answer is, and escape from the constraint that the answer is a set of tuples;
on the contrary, we complement the set of tuples with models (typically, but
not exclusively, results of data mining algorithms over the involved data) that
concisely represent the internal structure or correlations of the data. Due to
the diverse nature of the involved models, we come up (for the first time ever,
to the best of our knowledge) with a unifying framework for them, that places
its pillars on the extension of each data cell of a cube with information about
the models that pertain to it -- practically converting the small parts that
build up the models to data that annotate each cell. We exploit this
data-to-model mapping to provide highlights of the data, by isolating data and
models that maximize the delivery of new information to the user. We introduce
a novel method for assessing the surprise that a new query result brings to the
user, with respect to the information contained in previous results the user
has seen via a new interestingness measure. The individual parts of our
proposal are integrated in a new data model for OLAP, which we call the

their interpretation depends critically on the efficiency of metal/silicate
chemical equilibration, which is poorly constrained. Fluid dynamics experiments
suggest that, before its fragmentation, a volume of liquid metal falling into a
magma ocean undergoes a change of topology from a compact volume of metal
toward a collection of sheets and ligaments. We investigate here to what extent
the vigorous stretching of the metal phase by the turbulent flow can increase
the equilibration efficiency through what is known as stretching enhanced
diffusion. We obtain scaling laws giving the equilibration times of sheets and
ligaments as functions of a P\'eclet number based on the stretching rate. At
large P\'eclet, stretching drastically decreases the equilibration time, which
in this limit depends only weakly on the diffusivity. We also perform 2D
numerical simulations of the evolution of a volume of metal falling into a
magma ocean, from which we identify several equilibration regimes depending on
the values of the P\'eclet (Pe), Reynolds (Re), and Bond (Bo) numbers. At large
Pe, Re and Bo, the metal phase is vigorously stretched and convoluted in what
we call a stirring regime. The equilibration time is found to be independent of
viscosity and surface tension and depends weakly on diffusivity. Equilibration
is controlled by an efficient thermochemical stretching enhanced diffusion
mechanism developing from the mean flow and entraining the surrounding silicate
phase.

nanoparticles that acquire dissimilar charges when suspended in an aqueous

as a rheology modifier in a variety of commercial water-based products.
Particularly, aqueous dispersion of Laponite undergoes liquid - to - solid
transition at about 1 volume % concentration. The evolution of the physical
properties as dispersion transforms to solid state is reminiscent of physical
aging in molecular as well as colloidal glasses. The corresponding soft glassy
dynamics of an aqueous Laponite dispersion, including the rheological behavior,
has been extensively studied in the literature. In this feature article we take
an overview of recent advances in understanding soft glassy dynamics and
various efforts taken to understand the peculiar rheological behaviors.
Furthermore, the continuously developing microstructure that is responsible for
eventual formation of soft solid state that supports its own weight against
gravity has also been a topic of intense debate and discussion. Particularly
extensive experimental and theoretical studies lead to two types of
microstructures for this system: an attractive gel-like or repulsive glass
like. We carefully examine and critically analyze the literature and propose a
state diagram that suggests aqueous Laponite dispersion to be present in an
attractive gel state.

post-Newtonian and effective one body waveforms for the early inspiral. We
present NRHybSur3dq8, a surrogate model for hybridized nonprecessing numerical
relativity waveforms, that is valid for the entire LIGO band (starting at
$20~\text{Hz}$) for stellar mass binaries with total masses as low as
$2.25\,M_{\odot}$. We include the $\ell \leq 4$ and $(5,5)$ spin-weighted
spherical harmonic modes but not the $(4,1)$ or $(4,0)$ modes. This model has
been trained against hybridized waveforms based on 104 NR waveforms with mass
ratios $q\leq8$, and $|\chi_{1z}|,|\chi_{2z}| \leq 0.8$, where $\chi_{1z}$
($\chi_{2z}$) is the spin of the heavier (lighter) BH in the direction of

accurately, with mismatches $\lesssim 3\times10^{-4}$ over the mass range

($M\gtrsim40M_{\odot}$), where the merger and ringdown are more prominent, we
show roughly two orders of magnitude improvement over existing waveform models.
We also show that the surrogate works well even when extrapolated outside its

we show that this model accurately reproduces the spheroidal-spherical mode
mixing present in the NR ringdown signal.

practitioners and researchers alike. Scrum is one method that supports agile
working. Empirical research on the Scrum Master role remains scarce and reveals
contradicting results. While the Scrum Master role is often centred on one
person in rather immature teams, the role is expected to be shared among
multiple members in mature teams. Objective: Therefore, we aim to understand
how the Scrum Master role changes while the team matures. Method: We applied
Grounded Theory and conducted qualitative interviews with 53 practitioners of
29 software and non-software project teams from Robert Bosch GmbH. Results: We
discovered that Scrum Masters initially plays nine leadership roles which they
transfer to the team while it matures. Roles can be transferred by providing a
leadership gap, which allows team members to take on a leadership role, and by
providing an internal team environment with communication on equal terms,
psychological safety, transparency, shared understanding, shared purpose and
self-efficacy. Conclusion: The Scrum Master role changes while the team
matures. Trust and freedom to take over a leadership role in teams are
essential enablers. Our results support practitioners in implementing agile

as precisely as possible, to which we implement a relatively accurate detection
of rain streaks by utilizing two characteristics of rain streaks.The key
component of our method is to represent the intensity of each detected rain
pixel using a linear model: $p=\alpha s + \beta$, where $p$ is the observed
intensity of a rain pixel and $s$ represents the intensity of the background
(i.e., before rain-affected). To solve $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for each detected
rain pixel, we concentrate on a window centered around it and form an
$L_2$-norm cost function by considering all detected rain pixels within the
window, where the corresponding rain-removed intensity of each detected rain
pixel is estimated by some neighboring non-rain pixels. By minimizing this cost
function, we determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so as to construct the final
rain-removed pixel intensity. Compared with several state-of-the-art works, our
proposed method can remove rain streaks from a single color image much more

proposed to accelerate the swarm convergence with angular velocity and position

virtual rigid body and controlled to maintain a desired geometric shape among
the paths created while the centroid of the group follows a pre-determined
trajectory. Based on the testbed of 3DR Solo drones equipped with a proprietary

monoenergetic carbon ion beams with range in water from 3 to 30\,cm and

programming self-assembly. DNA selectivity provides direct control over
colloid-colloid interactions allowing the engineering of structures such as
complex crystals or gels. However, self-assembly of localized and finite
structures remains an open problem with many potential applications. In this
work, we present a system in which functionalized surfaces initiate a cascade
reaction between linkers leading to self-assembly of crystals with a
controllable number of layers. Specifically, we consider colloidal particles
functionalized by two families of complementary DNA linkers with mobile
anchoring points, as found in experiments using emulsions or lipid bilayers. In
bulk, intra-particle linkages formed by pairs of complementary linkers prevent
the formation of inter-particle bridges and therefore colloid-colloid
aggregation. However, colloids interact strongly with the surface given that
the latter can destabilize intra-particle linkages. When in direct contact with
the surface, colloids are activated, meaning that they feature more unpaired
DNA linkers ready to react. Activated colloids can then capture and activate
other colloids from the bulk through the formation of inter-particle linkages.
Using simulations and theory, validated by existing experiments, we clarify the
thermodynamics of the activation and binding process and explain how
particle-particle interactions, within the adsorbed phase, weaken as a function
of the distance from the surface. The latter observation underlies the
possibility of self-assembling finite aggregates with controllable thickness
and flat solid-gas interfaces. Our design suggests a new avenue to fabricate
heterogeneous and finite structures.

wireless networks since it reduces the signalling overhead caused by
conventional grant-based schemes. However, for grant-free transmission, the
number of users admitted to the same channel is not caped, which can lead to a
failure of multi-user detection. This paper proposes non-orthogonal
multiple-access (NOMA) assisted semi-grant-free (SGF) transmission, which is a
compromise between grant-free and grant-based schemes. In particular, instead
of reserving channels either for grant-based users or grant-free users, we
focus on an SGF communication scenario, where users are admitted to the same
channel via a combination of grant-based and grant-free protocols. As a result,
a channel reserved by a grant-based user can be shared by grant-free users,
which improves both connectivity and spectral efficiency. Two NOMA assisted SGF
contention control mechanisms are developed to ensure that, with a small amount
of signalling overhead, the number of admitted grant-free users is carefully
controlled and the interference from the grant-free users to the grant-based
users is effectively suppressed. Analytical results are provided to demonstrate
that the two proposed SGF mechanisms employing different successive
interference cancelation decoding orders are applicable to different practical

investigate the interaction of its radio lobes with the surrounding environment

data at 21cm were combined with newly reduced archival WSRT polarisation data
at the same wavelength to investigate the polarised emission in the radio lobes
of B2 0258+35 where we detected a unique S-shaped polarised structure. We
calculated the pressure to $p=1.95 \pm 0.4 \cdot 10^{-14}$ dyn cm$^{-2}$ using
an energy equipartition approach and investigate the physical processes leading
to the detected emission. We observe depolarisation in the northern lobe, which
might originate from the HI-disc in the foreground. In addition we see an
anti-correlation between the pressure and the fractional polarisation along the
S-shaped structure. Our results suggest that magnetic draping can be
effectively used to explain the observed polarised structures. This is likely
due to the combination of a relatively low magnetic field strength
($B_{eq}=1.21 \pm 0.12 \mu$G), enabling super-Alfv\'enic motion of the rising
lobes ($M_A=2.47-3.50$), and the coherency of the surrounding magnetic field.
Moreover, the draped layer tends to suppress any mixing of the material between
the radio lobes and the surrounding environment, but can enhance the mixing and
re-acceleration efficiencies inside the lobes, providing an explanation for the
average flat spectral index observed in the lobes.

the topological response is determined by combining magnetotransport data with
an independent magnetometry experiment. This approach is prone to introduce

excitations in molecular aggregates is generally expected to be suppressed by
noise and dissipative processes. Hence, quantum phenomena are not considered to
be relevant for the design of efficient and controllable energy transfer over
significant length and time scales. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, here
we show that the robust quantum properties of small configurations of repeating
clusters of molecules can be used to tune energy transfer mechanism that take
place on much larger scales. With the support of an exactly solvable model, we
demonstrate that coherent exciton delocalization and dark states within unit
cells can be used to harness dissipative phenomena of varying nature
(thermalization, fluorescence, non-radiative decay and weak inter-site
correlations) to support classical propagation over macroscopic distances. In
particular, we argue that coherent delocalization of electronic excitations
over just a few pigments can drastically alter the relevant dissipation
pathways which influence the energy transfer mechanism, and thus serve as a
molecular control tool for large-scale properties of molecular materials.
Building on these principles, we use extensive numerical simulations to
demonstrate that they can explain currently not understood measurements of
micron-scale exciton diffusion in nano-fabricated arrays of bacterial
photosynthetic complexes. Based on these results we provide quantum design
guidelines at the molecular scale to optimize both energy transfer speed and
range over macroscopic distances in artificial light-harvesting architectures.

identify that for high-transmission interfaces, the commonly assumed phonon
local thermal equilibrium adjacent to the interface fails, and the measurable
phonon temperatures are not their emission temperature. We hence develop a

high-dispersion spectroscopy-based empirical calibration of the Stromgren
metallicity sensitive index m1 for yellow and red supergiants (SGs). Particular
care was given while estimating their respective uncertainties. In order to
obtain the mean cluster metallicities, we used [Fe/H] values of selected SGs
for which we required to be located within the cluster radii, placed in the
expected SG region in the cluster colour-magnitude diagrams, and with [Fe/H]
values within the FWHM of the observed cluster metallicity distributions. The
resulting metallicities for nearly 75 per cent of the cluster sample agree well
with the most frequently used values of the mean MCs' present-day
metallicities. The remaining clusters have mean [Fe/H] values that fall near
the edge of the MC present-day metallicity distributions. When comparing the
cluster metallicities with their present positions, we found evidence that
supports the claimed recent interaction of the MCs with the Milky Way, that
could have caused that some clusters were scattered from their birthplaces.
Indeed, we show examples of clusters with metal contents typical of the galaxy
inner regions placed outward them. Likewise, we found young clusters, at
present located in the inner regions of both MCs, formed out of gas that has
remained unmixed since several Gyr ago.

i.e. the Galois group of $f$ equals the wreath product of the symmetric group

prove this equality and study its multidimensional generalization: we show that
the Galois group of a general system of polynomial equations equals the

scaling of overshooting depth ($d_{\rm os}$) at the base of the convection zone
as a function of imposed energy flux ($\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$) and to estimate
the extent of overshooting at the base of the solar convection zone. Methods:
Three-dimensional Cartesian simulations of compressible non-rotating convection
with unstable and stable layers are used. The simulations use either a fixed
heat conduction profile or a temperature and density dependent formulation
based on Kramers opacity law. The simulations cover a range of almost four
orders of magnitude in the imposed flux. Results: A smooth heat conduction
profile (either fixed or through Kramers opacity law) leads to a relatively
shallow power law with $d_{\rm os}\propto \mathscr{F}_{\rm n}^{0.08}$ for low
$\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$. A fixed step-profile of the heat conductivity at the
bottom of the convection zone leads to a somewhat steeper dependency with
$d_{\rm os}\propto \mathscr{F}_{\rm n}^{0.12}$. Experiments with and without
subgrid-scale entropy diffusion revealed a strong dependence on the effective
Prandtl number which is likely to explain the steep power laws as a function of
$\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$ reported in the literature. Furthermore, changing the
heat conductivity artificially below the convection zone is shown to lead to
substantial underestimation of overshooting depth. Conclusions: Extrapolating
from the results obtained with smooth heat conductivity profiles suggest that
the overshooting depth for the solar flux is of the order of $0.2$ pressure
scale heights at the base of the convection zone which is two to four times
higher than estimates from helioseismology.

compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy with a redshift z=0.133 was selected from the Data
Release 14 (DR14) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Its properties are
extreme in many ways. Its oxygen abundance 12 + log O/H = 7.035+/-0.026 is
among the lowest ever observed for a SFG. Its absolute magnitude Mg = -17.35
mag makes it the brightest galaxy among the known BCDs with 12 + log O/H < 7.3.
With its low metallicity, low stellar mass M* = 10^7.13 Msun and very low
mass-to-light ratio M*/Lg ~ 0.01 (in solar units), it deviates strongly from
the mass-metallicity and luminosity-metallicity relations defined by the bulk
of the SFGs in SDSS DR14. J1234+3901 has a very high specific star-formation
rate sSFR ~ 100 Gyr^-1, indicating very active ongoing star-formation. Its
spectrum shows a strong HeII 4686 emission line, with a flux ~ 2.4 per cent
that of the Hbeta emission line. The most probable source of ionizing radiation
for producing such a strong line is fast radiative shocks. J1234+3901 has a
ratio O32 = [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ~ 15, the highest among the lowest-metallicity
SFGs, and is thus likely leaking Lyman continuum radiation. It is a good
candidate for being a young dwarf galaxy, with a large fraction of its stars
formed recently. As such, it is probably one of the best local counterparts of
dwarf primeval galaxies responsible for the reionization of the early Universe.

can be used to target surfaces selectively depending on their receptor density.
Typically, there is a sharp onset of multivalent binding as the receptor
density exceeds a given threshold. However, the opposite case, selectively
binding to surfaces with a receptor density below a given threshold, is much
harder. Here, we present a simple strategy for selectively targeting a surface
with a low density of receptors, within a system also having a surface with a
higher density of the same receptors. Our strategy exploits competitive
adsorption of two species. The first species, called ""guards"", are
receptor-sized monovalent particles designed to occupy the high-density surface
at equilibrium, while the second multivalent ""attacker"" species outcompetes the
guards for binding onto the low-density surface. Surprisingly, the recipe for
attackers and guards yields more selective binding with stronger
ligand-receptor association constants, in contrast to standard multivalency. We
derive explicit expressions for the attacker and guard molecular design
parameters and concentrations, optimised within bounds of what is
experimentally accessible, thereby facilitating implementation of the proposed
approach.

This quadratic-in-spin, self-spin effect depends on the equation of state (EOS)

We incorporate the EOS-dependent self-spin (or monopole-quadrupole) terms in
the spin-aligned effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model TEOBResumS at
next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) order, together with other (bilinear, cubic and
quartic) nonlinear-in-spin effects (at leading order, LO). The structure of the
Hamiltonian of TEOBResumS is such that it already incorporates, in the binary
black hole case, the recently computed quartic-in-spin LO term. Using the
gauge-invariant characterization of the phasing provided by the function
$Q_\omega=\omega^2/\dot{\omega}$ of $\omega=2\pi f$ , where $f$ is the
gravitational wave frequency, we study the EOS dependence of the self-spin
effects and show that: (i) the next-to-leading order (NLO) and NNLO
monopole-quadrupole corrections yield increasingly phase-accelerating effects
compared to the corresponding LO contribution; (ii) the standard TaylorF2
post-Newtonian (PN) treatment of NLO (3PN) EOS-dependent self-spin effects
makes their action stronger than the corresponding EOB description; (iii) the
addition to the standard 3PN TaylorF2 post-Newtonian phasing description of
self-spin tail effects at LO allows one to reconcile the self-spin part of the
TaylorF2 PN phasing with the corresponding TEOBResumS one up to dimensionless
frequencies $M\omega\simeq 0.04-0.06$. By generating the inspiral dynamics
using the post-adiabatic approximation, incorporated in a new implementation of
TEOBResumS, one finds that the computational time needed to obtain a typical

entities in the presence of time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In contrast, bosonic
systems obeying TRS are generally assumed to be fundamentally precluded from
supporting edge states. In this work, we dispel this perception and
experimentally demonstrate counter-propagating chiral states at the edge of a
time-reversal-symmetric photonic waveguide structure. The pivotal step in our
approach is encoding the effective spin of the propagating states as a degree
of freedom of the underlying waveguide lattice, such that our photonic
topological insulator is characterised by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-type invariant. Our
findings allow for fermionic properties to be harnessed in bosonic systems,
thereby opening new avenues for topological physics in photonics as well as
acoustics, mechanics and even matter waves.

  Networking and Processing",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an energy efficient IoT virtualization framework with P2P
networking and edge computing is proposed. In this network, the IoT task
processing requests are served by peers. The peers in our work are represented
by IoT objects and relays that host virtual machines (VMs). We have considered
three scenarios to investigate the saving in power consumption and the system
capabilities in terms of task processing. The first scenario is the relays only
scenario, where the task requests are processed using relays only. The second
scenario is the objects only scenario, where the task requests are processed
using the IoT objects only. The last scenario is a hybrid scenario, where the
task requests are processed using both IoT objects and VMs. We have developed a
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to maximize the number of
processing tasks served by the system and minimize the total power consumed by
the IoT network. We investigated our framework under the impact of VMs
placement constraints, fairness constraints between the objects, tasks number
limitations, uplink and downlink limited capacities, and processing capability
limitations. Based on the MILP model principles, we developed an energy
efficient virtualized IoT P2P networks heuristic (EEVIPN). The heuristic
results were comparable to those of the MILP in terms of energy efficiency and
tasks processing. Our results show that the hybrid scenario serves up to 77%
(57% on average) processing task requests, but with higher energy consumption
compared to the other scenarios. The relays only scenario can serve 74% (57% on
average) of the processing task requests with 8% saving in power consumption
compared to the hybrid scenario. In contrast, 28% (22% on average) of task
requests can be successfully handled by applying the objects only scenario with
up to 62% power saving compared to the hybrid scenario.

as a function of the collision energy, the production of thermal dimuons from
the created system, from which one would obtain a caloric curve of the QCD
phase diagram that is sensitive to the order of the phase transition. In
addition, the measurement of a $\rho$-a$_1$ mixing contribution would provide
conclusive insights into the restoration of the chiral symmetry of QCD. In
parallel, studies of heavy quark and quarkonium production would also be
carried out, addressing the measurement of transport properties of the QGP and
the investigation of the onset of the deconfinement transition. The document
also defines an experimental set-up which couples a vertex telescope based on
monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) to a muon spectrometer with tracking

so-called Malthusian behaviour fails. In this work we further analyse the
critical case by considering a piecewise linear growth, namely \begin{equation}

unlikely that ""lazy training"" is behind the many successes of neural networks

ionospheric cutoff in dealing with the interference, ionosphere, and wide-field

radioastronomic experiments on the Moon. In this purpose we observed
non-intensive solar bursts on the example of solar drift pairs (DP) at
decameter-meter wavelengths with large and small arrays as well as by a single
crossed active dipole. We used the large Ukrainian radio telescope UTR-2, the
URAN-2 array, a subarray of the Giant Ukrainian radio telescope (GURT) and a
single crossed active dipole to get the spectral properties of radio bursts at
the frequency range of 8-80 MHz during solar observations on July 12, 2017.
Statistical analysis of upper and lower frequencies, at which DPs are recorded,
shows that the occurrence of forward DPs is more preferable at lower
frequencies of the decameter range of observations in comparison with reverse
DPs generated more likely at meter wavelengths. We conclude that DPs can be
detected not only by antenna arrays, but even by a single crossed active

is allowed to act as an active agent (i.e., a provider of regulating energy) in
some trading intervals and as a passive agent (i.e., a user of regulating
energy) in some others. To illustrate and evaluate the proposed market
framework, we consider the case of a virtual power plant (VPP) that trades in a
two-settlement electricity market composed of a day-ahead and a dual-price
balancing market. We formulate the optimal market offering problem of the VPP
as a three-stage stochastic program, where uncertainty is in the day-ahead
electricity prices, balancing prices and the power output from the renewable
units. Computational experiments show that the VPP expected revenues can
increase substantially compared to an active-only or passive-only
participation, and in the paper we discuss how the variability of the
stochastic sources affects the balancing market participation choice.

accelerating structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. For the
first stage, an alternative with X-band klystron powering is also considered.
CLIC accelerator optimisation, technical developments, and system tests have
resulted in significant progress in recent years. Moreover, this has led to an
increased energy efficiency and reduced power consumption of around 170 MW for
the 380 GeV stage, together with a reduced cost estimate of approximately 6
billion CHF. The detector concept, which matches the physics performance
requirements and the CLIC experimental conditions, has been refined using
improved software tools for simulation and reconstruction. Significant progress
has been made on detector technology developments for the tracking and
calorimetry systems. The construction of the first CLIC energy stage could
start as early as 2026 and first beams would be available by 2035, marking the
beginning of a physics programme spanning 25-30 years and providing excellent
sensitivity to Beyond Standard Model physics, through direct searches and via a
broad set of precision measurements of Standard Model processes, particularly

Most of the previous methods extract the fine-grained details via random
cropping strategy, which may undermine the integrity of semantic information.
Extensive studies show that humans perceive fine-grained details with a mixture
of foveal vision and peripheral vision. Fovea has the highest possible visual
acuity and is responsible for seeing the details. The peripheral vision is used
for perceiving the broad spatial scene and selecting the attended regions for
the fovea. Inspired by these observations, we propose a Gated Peripheral-Foveal
Convolutional Neural Network (GPF-CNN). It is a dedicated double-subnet neural
network, i.e. a peripheral subnet and a foveal subnet. The former aims to mimic
the functions of peripheral vision to encode the holistic information and
provide the attended regions. The latter aims to extract fine-grained features
on these key regions. Considering that the peripheral vision and foveal vision
play different roles in processing different visual stimuli, we further employ
a gated information fusion (GIF) network to weight their contributions. The
weights are determined through the fully connected layers followed by a sigmoid
function. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the standard AVA and

quality classification; (ii) aesthetic score regression; and (iii) aesthetic

changes, and places with positive increases are brought closer to failure.
Earthquake models that relate earthquake rates and Coulomb stress after a main
event, such as the rate-and-state model, assume that the magnitude distribution
of earthquakes is not affected by the change in the Coulomb stress. By using
different slip models, we calculate the change in Coulomb stress in the fault

the distribution of magnitudes is sensitive to the sign of the Coulomb-stress

the events with a positive increase of the stress are characterized by a much
larger proportion of strike-slip events in comparison with the seismicity
previous to the mainshock, the events happening despite a decrease in Coulomb
stress show no relevant differences in focal-mechanism distribution with

propagating in the bulk. The resulting setup is minimal, as neither extra
matter, effective operators, nor extra $U(1)$ groups are needed in order to be
viable. The model has three free parameters which are fixed by the Higgsino
mass -- set to the range 1.1-1.2 TeV so it can play the role of Dark Matter,
and by the requirements of correct electroweak breaking and the mass of the
Higgs. After imposing the previous conditions we find a benchmark scenario that

electroweakinos and sleptons almost degenerate in the range 1.7-1.9 TeV and

experiments. The model is natural, as the fine-tuning for the fixed values of

SU(2) gauge field background with a non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin density. We
show that the asymmetric fermion production, together with a non-trivial vacuum
contribution, correctly reproduces the chiral anomaly. This indicates that the
usual vacuum subtraction scheme, imposing normal ordering, fails in this case.
As a concrete example of this gauge field background, we consider
chromo-natural inflation. Applying our analysis to this particular model, we
compute the backreaction of the generated fermions on the gauge field
background. This backreaction receives contributions both from the vacuum
through a Coleman-Weinberg-type correction and from the fermion excitations
through an induced current.

to earth ($d\sim400$ pc). It contains the rich Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) in
the North, and low-mass star-forming regions (L1641, L1647) to the South. To
get a better understanding of the differences in star formation activity, we
perform an analysis of the gas mass distribution and star formation rate across
the cloud. We find that the gas is roughly uniformly distributed, while, oddly,
the ONC region produced about a factor of ten more stars compared to the rest
of the cloud. For a better interpretation of this phenomenon, we use Gaia DR2
parallaxes, to analyse distances of young stellar objects, using them as proxy
for cloud distances. We find that the ONC region indeed lies at about 400 pc
while the low-mass star-forming parts are inclined about 70$^\circ$ from the
plane of the sky reaching until $\sim$470 pc. With this we estimate that Orion
A is an about 90 pc long filamentary cloud (about twice as long as previously
assumed), with its ""Head"" (the ONC region) being ""bent"" and oriented toward the
galactic mid-plane. This striking new view allows us to perform a more robust

which exploits several different segmentation criteria and mines their common

be decomposed into multiple sub-criteria, which are shareable with other
segmentation criteria. The process of word segmentation is a routing among
these sub-criteria. From this perspective, we present Switch-LSTMs to segment
words, which consist of several long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM),
and a switcher to automatically switch the routing among these LSTMs. With
these auto-switched LSTMs, our model provides a more flexible solution for
multi-criteria CWS, which is also easy to transfer the learned knowledge to new
criteria. Experiments show that our model obtains significant improvements on

using a continuous {limit} for the electron spectra, we derive

derive from these equations rate-type differential equations for ET dynamics.
We formulate the conditions of validity of the rate-type equations. We consider
different regions of parameters characterizing the widths of the donor and

simplified model with a single energy level donor and a continuous acceptor
band, we derive a generalized analytic expression and provide numerical
simulations for the ET rate. They are consistent with Wigner-Weisskopf,
F\""orster-type, and Marcus-type expressions, in their corresponding regime of
parameters.Our analytic results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We
demonstrate how our theoretical results are modified {when both the donor and

renewed interest and effort toward elucidating the mechanism(s) by which they
are formed. To date, the dominant hypothesis, cellular solidification followed
by dislocation-solute entanglement, remains incompatible with the ensemble of
reported observations from multiple independent studies. This effort offers
direct evidence of a previously unrecognized interaction of phenomena, that,
when acting in concert, give rise to this commonly observed substructure. These

significant improvement in image quality. Moreover, we demonstrate that greater
improvement can be achieved through a learning-based design of the transmitted

we characterise the mid-J CO emission in a statistical sample of 99 clumps

Galactic proto-cluster population. High-spatial resolution APEX-CHAMP+ maps of
the CO(6-5) and CO(7-6) transitions were obtained and combined with additional
single-pointing APEX-FLASH+ spectra of the CO(4-3) line. We study the
correlations of the CO line luminosities and profiles for the three CO
transitions with the clump properties and investigate if and how they change as
a function of the evolution. All sources were detected above 3-$\sigma$ in all
three CO transitions and most of the sources exhibit broad CO emission likely
associated with molecular outflows. We found that the extension of the mid-J CO
emission is correlated with the size of the dust emission traced by the
Herschel-PACS 70 $\mu$m maps. The CO line luminosity is correlated with the
luminosity and mass of the clumps. However, it does not correlate with the L/M
ratio. The dependency of the CO luminosity with the properties of the clumps is
steeper for higher-J transitions. Our data seem to exclude that this trend is
biased by self-absorption features in the CO emission, but rather suggest that
different J transitions arise from different regions of the inner envelope.
Moreover, high-mass clumps show similar trends in CO luminosity as lower mass
clumps, but are systematically offset towards larger values, suggesting that
higher column density and/or temperature (of unresolved) CO emitters are found
inside high-mass clumps.

for numerous machine learning tasks, quantifying the robustness of these models
has become an important area of research. However, most of the research
literature merely focuses on the \textit{worst-case} setting where the input of
the neural network is perturbed with noises that are constrained within an
$\ell_p$ ball; and several algorithms have been proposed to compute certified
lower bounds of minimum adversarial distortion based on such worst-case
analysis. In this paper, we address these limitations and extend the approach
to a \textit{probabilistic} setting where the additive noises can follow a
given distributional characterization. We propose a novel probabilistic
framework PROVEN to PRObabilistically VErify Neural networks with statistical
guarantees -- i.e., PROVEN certifies the probability that the classifier's
top-1 prediction cannot be altered under any constrained $\ell_p$ norm
perturbation to a given input. Importantly, we show that it is possible to
derive closed-form probabilistic certificates based on current state-of-the-art
neural network robustness verification frameworks. Hence, the probabilistic
certificates provided by PROVEN come naturally and with almost no overhead when
obtaining the worst-case certified lower bounds from existing methods such as
Fast-Lin, CROWN and CNN-Cert. Experiments on small and large MNIST and CIFAR
neural network models demonstrate our probabilistic approach can achieve up to
around $75\%$ improvement in the robustness certification with at least a
$99.99\%$ confidence compared with the worst-case robustness certificate
delivered by CROWN.

$Ab$ $initio$ molecular orbital calculations indicate the formation of an

interaction with two types of inequivalent site. Further, the $S_{\rm{V}}$=1/2

(AF) interactions. The magnetic properties indicate that the dominant AF
interactions between the $S_{\rm{V}}$ = 1/2 spins form a gapped singlet state,
and the remaining $S_{\rm{Fe}}$ = 5/2 spins cause an AF order. The
magnetization curve exhibits a linear increase up to approximately 7 T, and an
unconventional 5/6 magnetization plateau appears between 7 T and 40 T. We
discuss the differences between the effective interactions associated with the
magnetic properties of the present compound and ($o$-MePy-V)FeCl$_4$. We
explain the low-field linear magnetization curve through a mean-field
approximation of an $S_{\rm{Fe}}$ = 5/2 spin model. At higher field regions,
the 5/6 magnetization plateau and subsequent nonlinear increase are reproduced
by the $S_{\rm{V}}$ = 1/2 AF dimer, in which a particular internal field is
applied to one of the spin sites. The ESR resonance signals in the
low-temperature and low-field regime are explained by conventional
two-sublattice AF resonance modes with easy-axis anisotropy. These results
demonstrate that exchange interactions between $S_{\rm{V}}$ = 1/2 and
$S_{\rm{Fe}}$ = 5/2 spins in $[$$o$-MePy-V-($p$-Br)$_2]$FeCl$_4$ realize
unconventional magnetic properties with low-field classical behavior and

classified according to some centrality estimator (e.g. the number of produced
charged particles) related to the initial energy density and volume of the
system. In a naive picture the latter are directly related to the impact
parameter of the two nuclei, which sets also the initial eccentricity of the
system: zero in the case of the most central events and getting larger for more
peripheral collisions. A more realistic modelling requires to take into account
event-by-event fluctuations, in particular in the nucleon positions within the
colliding nuclei: collisions belonging to the same centrality class can give
rise to systems with different initial eccentricity and hence different flow
harmonics for the final hadron distributions. This issue can be addressed by an
event-shape-engineering analysis, consisting in selecting events with the same
centrality but different magnitude of the average bulk anisotropic flow and
therefore of the initial-state eccentricity. In this paper we present the
implementation of this analysis in the POWLANG transport model, providing
predictions for the transverse-momentum and angular distributions of charm and
beauty hadrons for event-shape selected collisions. In this way it is possible
to get information on how the heavy quarks propagating (and hadronizing) in a
hot environment respond both to its energy density and to its geometric
asymmetry, breaking the perfect correlation between eccentricity and impact
parameter which characterizes a modelling of the medium based on smooth average
initial conditions

with the data size at a reasonable rate; in reality, anomalies tend to be the
minority of the data, and this issue can be more serious. We propose a
framework with two novel randomized algorithms rPS and gPS for better detection
of correlated anomalies from large streaming data of various correlation
strength. The experiment shows high and balanced recall and estimated accuracy
of our framework for anomaly detection from a large server log data set and a
U.S. stock daily price data set in comparison to direct principal score
evaluation and some other recent group anomaly detection algorithms. Moreover,
our techniques significantly improve the computation efficiency and scalability
for principal score calculation.

hybrid thermal LB model is then applied in the simulation of bubble nucleation
and boiling heat transfer. With an innovative nucleation site treatment on the
wall, the complete boiling stages as well as the boiling curve were
successfully reproduced without adding any heating fluctuations. The bubble
nucleation, growth, departure, and coalescence are well captured. Some basic
features of boiling heat transfer including bubble nucleation site activation,
bubble departure frequency, character of bubble shape at different regime, and
horizontal movement of bubble during the boiling process were clearly observed
in the numerical results.

on two classes of the plane analytic exact solutions, describing rectilinear
locomotion. Solutions of the first class describe the \emph{tumbling
locomotion}, while the second class corresponds to the \emph{zigzag locomotion}

desired direction and any speed of locomotion. As a special case, we consider
the self-propulsion caused by small-amplitude and high-frequency actuator
oscillations. The exact and elementary character of our solutions makes the

structural health and reliability of highway bridges. Currently, most of these
tasks are conducted manually which could be cumbersome and time-consuming.
Recent rapid advancement in convolution neural network has enabled the
development of deep learning-based visual inspection techniques for detecting
multiple structural damages. However, most deep learning-based techniques are
built on two-stage, proposal-driven detectors and using less complex image
data, which is not promising to promote practical applications and integration
within intelligent autonomous inspection systems. In this study, a faster,
simpler single-stage detector is proposed based on YOLOv3 for detecting
multiple concrete damages of highway bridges. To realize this, a bridge damage
dataset consisting of field inspection images is prepared. These images have
large variations in damage appearance and monitoring scene and are labeled with
four types of concrete damages: crack, pop-out, spalling and exposed rebar. The
original YOLOv3 is further improved by introducing a novel transfer learning
method, Batch Renormalization and Focal Loss. The improved YOLOv3 is evaluated
in terms of average precision and speed. The results show that the improved
YOLOv3 has a detection accuracy of up to 80%. Its performance is about 13%
better than the original YOLOv3.

points based on the proposed definition in NS. Then, certainty set is presented
for the proposed cost function in NS domain by considering a set of main
clusters and noise cluster. After that, the proposed cost function is minimized
by gradient descent method. Data points are clustered based on their membership
degrees. Outlier points are assigned to noise cluster and boundary points are
assigned to main clusters with almost same membership degrees. To show the
effectiveness of the proposed method, two types of datasets including 3
datasets in Scatter type and 4 datasets in UCI type are used. Results
demonstrate that the proposed cost function handles boundary and outlier points

  Restoration","11 pages, 15 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with

of face analysis recognition. However, most existing face restoration models
omit the multiple scale issues in face restoration problem, which is still not
well-solved in research area. In this paper, we propose a Sequential Gating
Ensemble Network (SGEN) for multi-scale noise robust face restoration issue. To
endow the network with multi-scale representation ability, we first employ the
principle of ensemble learning for SGEN network architecture designing. The
SGEN aggregates multi-level base-encoders and base-decoders into the network,
which enables the network to contain multiple scales of receptive field.
Instead of combining these base-en/decoders directly with non-sequential
operations, the SGEN takes base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential
data. Specifically, it is visualized that SGEN learns to sequentially extract
high level information from base-encoders in bottom-up manner and restore low
level information from base-decoders in top-down manner. Besides, we propose to
realize bottom-up and top-down information combination and selection with
Sequential Gating Unit (SGU). The SGU sequentially takes information from two
different levels as inputs and decides the output based on one active input.
Experiment results on benchmark dataset demonstrate that our SGEN is more
effective at multi-scale human face restoration with more image details and
less noise than state-of-the-art image restoration models. Further utilizing
adversarial training scheme, SGEN also produces more visually preferred results
than other models under subjective evaluation.

  Extraction Algorithm to Classify Musical Content with Simple Features",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a novel feature selection algorithm to classify Songs into
different groups. Classification of musical content is often a non-trivial job
and still relatively less explored area. The main idea conveyed in this article
is to come up with a new feature selection scheme that does the classification
job elegantly and with high accuracy but with simpler but wisely chosen small
number of features thus being less prone to over-fitting. This uses a very
basic general idea about the structure of the audio signal which is generally
in the shape of a trapezium. So, using this general idea of the Musical
Community we propose three frames to be considered and analyzed for feature
extraction for each of the audio signal -- opening, stanzas and closing -- and
it has been established with the help of a lot of experiments that this scheme
leads to much efficient classification with less complex features in a low
dimensional feature space thus is also a computationally less expensive method.
Step by step analysis of feature extraction, feature ranking, dimensionality
reduction using PCA has been carried in this article. Sequential Forward
selection (SFS) algorithm is used to explore the most significant features both
with the raw Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and also with the significant
eigen-values after PCA. Also during classification extensive validation and
cross validation has been done in a monte-carlo manner to ensure validity of
the claims.

  Photomultiplication through Adjusting Photogenerated Carrier Distributions",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Organic photodetectors (OPDs) based on trap-assisted photomultiplication (PM)
effect with external quantum efficiency (EQE) far exceeding 100% are quite
appealing for achieving highly sensitive photodetection. A classic structure of
PM-type OPDs is based on the active layer of P3HT:PC70BM with the weight ratio
of 100:1, in which PC70BM forms islands and supply bulk electron traps for
inducing strong interfacial band bending and thus hole tunneling from the Al
electrode. In this paper, aiming for optimizing the PM effect, we study the
photogenerated carrier distribution by tuning thickness of the active layer
(P3HT:PC70BM). The combination effect of both the exciton generation and
exciton dissociation processes affects the photogenerated carrier distribution,
which ultimately determines the PM performances of OPDs. On the one hand,
simulation reveals that the thinner the active layer, the stronger exciton
generation near the Al electrode. On the other hand, the photoluminescence and
surface morphology studies reflect that the active layer with thickness of 230
nm has the smooth surface and produces the highest exciton dissociation rate.
The two effects result in the OPD with a 205 nm thick active layer has the
champion EQE (105569%) and photoresponsivity (344 A/W), corresponding to an
enhancement of 330% with respect to the OPD with a 325 nm thick active layer.
Ascribed to the trade off of EQE and dark current, the detectivity performs
differently at different wavelength ranges. At short wavelength range, the
detectivity reaches the highest when the active layer is 205 nm thick, while
the highest detectivity at long wavelength range is produced by the thickest
active layer. Our work contributes to developing low cost organic
photodetectors for detecting weak light signals.
