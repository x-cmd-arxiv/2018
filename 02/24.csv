  Data from the Cognitive Tutor Algebra I Effectiveness Trial","In Submission",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mastery learning, the notion that students learn best if they move on from
studying a topic only after having demonstrated mastery, sits at the foundation
of the theory of intelligent tutoring. This paper is an exploration of how
mastery learning plays out in practice, based on log data from a large
randomized effectiveness trial of the Cognitive Tutor Algebra I (CTAI)
curriculum. We find that students frequently progressed from CTAI sections they
were working on without demonstrating mastery and worked units out of order.
Moreover, these behaviors were substantially more common in the second year of
the study, in which the CTAI effect was significantly larger. We explore the
various ways students departed from the official CTAI curriculum, focusing on
heterogeneity between years, states, schools, and students. The paper concludes
with an observational study of the effect on post-test scores of teachers
reassigning students out of their current sections before they mastered the
requisite skills, finding that reassignment appears to lowers posttest
scores--a finding that is fairly resilient to confounding from omitted
covariates--but that the effect varies substantially between classrooms.

autonomously by iteratively obtaining measurements. This process of planning
observations to improve the model of a scene is called Next Best View (NBV)
planning.
  NBV planning approaches often use either volumetric (e.g., voxel grids) or
surface (e.g., triangulated meshes) representations. Volumetric approaches
generalise well between scenes as they do not depend on surface geometry but do
not scale to high-resolution models of large scenes. Surface representations
can obtain high-resolution models at any scale but often require tuning of
unintuitive parameters or multiple survey stages.
  This paper presents a scene-model-free NBV planning approach with a density
representation. The Surface Edge Explorer (SEE) uses the density of current
measurements to detect and explore observed surface boundaries. This approach
is shown experimentally to provide better surface coverage in lower computation
time than the evaluated state-of-the-art volumetric approaches while moving
equivalent distances.

$- \tilde s \gg 1$ given by $-\log

at all times. We present two methods to derive the result (i) long time

cumulants of a determinantal point process where the successive cumulants
appear to give the successive orders of the large deviation rate function in
the large $\tilde s$ expansion. An interpretation in terms of large deviations
for trapped fermions at low temperature is also given. In addition, we perform
a similar calculation for the KPZ equation in a half-space with a droplet
initial condition, and show that the same tail as above arises, with the
prefactor $\frac{4}{15\pi}$ replaced by $\frac{2}{15\pi}$. Finally, the
arguments can be extended to show that this tail holds for all times. This is
consistent with the fact that the same tail was obtained previously in the
short time limit for the full-space problem.

Cox proportional hazards model (1972) fails to meet some emerging needs in
biomedical research. First, the number of covariates is generally much larger
the sample size. Secondly, predicting an outcome based on individual gene
expression is inadequate because multiple biological processes and functional
pathways regulate the expression associated with a gene. Another challenge is
that the Cox model assumes that populations are homogenous, implying that all
individuals have the same risk of death, which is rarely true due to unmeasured
risk factors among populations. In this paper we propose group LASSO with
gamma-distributed frailty for variable selection in Cox regression by extending
previous scholarship to account for heterogeneity among group structures
related to exposure and susceptibility. The consistency property of the
proposed method is established. This method is appropriate for addressing a
wide variety of research questions from genetics to air pollution. Simulated
analysis shows promising performance by group LASSO compared with other
methods, including group SCAD and group MCP. Future directions include
expanding the use of frailty with adaptive group LASSO and sparse group LASS.

Using non-local measurement, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of
helical dissipationless spin current using spin-Hall effect. Contrary to the
theoretical prediction, we observe the spin-Hall effect in both n-doped and
p-doped Si. The helical spin current is attributed to the site-inversion
asymmetry of the diamond cubic lattice of Si and structure inversion asymmetry
in MgO/Si bilayer. The spin to charge conversion in Si is insignificant due to
weak spin-orbit coupling. For the efficient detection of spin current, we
report spin to charge conversion at the MgO (1nm)/Si (2 um) (p-doped and
n-doped) thin film interface due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We detected the
spin current at a distance of >100 um, which is an order of magnitude larger
than the longest spin diffusion length measured using spin injection
techniques. The existence of spin current in Si is verified from coercivity
reduction in Co/Pd multilayer due to spin-orbit torque generated by spin
current from Si.

uses scintillating CaWO$_4$ crystals operated as cryogenic particle detectors.
Background discrimination is achieved by exploiting the scintillating light

paper. In a test setup above ground, a nuclear-recoil energy threshold of
$E_{th}=(190.6\pm5.2)$eV is reached with a 24g prototype detector, which
corresponds to an estimated threshold of $\sim$50eV when being operated in the
low-noise CRESST cryostat. This is the lowest threshold reported for direct
dark matter searches. For CRESST-III phase 1, ten such detector modules were
installed in the cryostat which have the potential to improve significantly the

in the nodal-line Weyl semimetals. Since the system under study has a
crystallographic anisotropy, the scattering properties are dependent on mutual
orientation of the crystalline axis and the barrier. To account for the
anisotropy, we examine two different barrier orientations. It is demonstrated
that, for certain angles of incidence, the incoming particle passes through the
barrier with probability of unity. This is a manifestation of the Klein
tunneling, a familiar phenomenon in the context of graphene and semimetals with
Weyl points. However, the Klein tunneling in the Weyl-ring systems is observed
when the angle of incidence differs from 90$^\circ$, unlike the cases of
graphene and Weyl-point semimetals. The reflectionless transmission also occurs
for the so-called `magic angles'. The values of `the magic angles' are
determined by geometrical resonances between the barrier width and the de
Broglie length of the scattered particle. In addition, we show that under
certain conditions the wave function of the transmitted and reflected particles
may be a superposition of two plane waves with unequal momenta. Such a feature
is a consequence of the non-trivial structure of the iso-energy surfaces of the
nodal-line semimetals.

their associated gamma-ray emissions can be used to constrain models of CR
propagation, trace the structure of the Galaxy, and search for signatures of
new physics. The spatial density distribution of the interstellar gas is a
vital element for all these studies. So far models have employed the 2D
cylindrically symmetric geometry, but their accuracy is well behind that of the
available data. In this paper, 3D spatial density models for the neutral and
molecular hydrogen are constructed based on empirical model fitting to gas
line-survey data. The developed density models incorporate spiral arms and
account for the warping of the disk, and the increasing gas scale height with
radial distance from the Galactic center. They are employed together with the
GALPROP CR propagation code to investigate how the new 3D gas models affect
calculations of CR propagation and high-energy gamma-ray intensity maps. The
calculations made reveal non-trivial features that are directly related to the
new gas models. The best-fit values for propagation model parameters employing
3D gas models are presented and they differ significantly from the values
derived with the 2D gas density models that have been widely used. The
combination of 3D CR and gas density models provide a more realistic basis for
the interpretation of non-thermal emissions from the Galaxy.

scattering. In agreement with previous studies, the parent compound SmFeAsO
exhibits a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion at
T$\rm{_{S}}$~=~130~K which is rapidly suppressed by $x \simeq$ 0.10 deep within
the superconducting dome. The change in unit cell symmetry is followed by a
previously unreported magnetoelastic distortion at 120~K. The temperature
dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha_{V}$ reveals a rich
phase diagram for SmFeAsO: (i) a global minimum at 125 K corresponds to the
opening of a spin-density wave instability as measured by pump-probe
femtosecond spectroscopy whilst (ii) a global maximum at 110 K corresponds to
magnetic ordering of the Sm and Fe sublattices as measured by magnetic x-ray
scattering. At much lower temperatures than T$\rm{_{N}}$, SmFeAsO exhibits a
significant negative thermal expansion on the order of -40~ppm~$\cdot$~K$^{-1}$
in contrast to the behavior of other rare-earth oxypnictides such as PrFeAsO
and the actinide oxypnictide NpFeAsO where the onset of $\alpha <$ 0 only
appears in the vicinity of magnetic ordering. Correlating this feature with the
temperature and doping dependence of the resistivity and the unit cell
parameters, we interpret the negative thermal expansion as being indicative of
the possible condensation of itinerant electrons accompanying the opening of a
SDW gap, consistent with transport measurements.

synchrotron-dominated) Sources (PCNT) observed between 30 and 857 GHz by the
ESA Planck mission. This catalogue was constructed by selecting objects
detected in the full mission all-sky temperature maps at 30 and 143 GHz, with a
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)>3 in at least one of the two channels after
filtering with a particular Mexican hat wavelet. As a result, 29400 source
candidates were selected. Then, a multi-frequency analysis was performed using
the Matrix Filters methodology at the position of these objects, and flux
densities and errors were calculated for all of them in the nine Planck
channels. The present catalogue is the first unbiased, full-sky catalogue of
synchrotron-dominated sources published at millimetre and submillimetre
wavelengths and constitutes a powerful database for statistical studies of
non-thermal extragalactic sources, whose emission is dominated by the central
active galactic nucleus. Together with the full multi-frequency catalogue, we
also define the Bright Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal Sources
PCNTb, where only those objects with a S/N>4 at both 30 and 143 GHz were
selected. In this catalogue 1146 compact sources are detected outside the
adopted Planck GAL070 mask; thus, these sources constitute a highly reliable
sample of extragalactic radio sources. We also flag the high-significance
subsample PCNThs, a subset of 151 sources that are detected with S/N>4 in all
nine Planck channels, 75 of which are found outside the Planck mask adopted
here. The remaining 76 sources inside the Galactic mask are very likely
Galactic objects.

results to expectations from condensed matter theory at weak coupling. We
analyze also the interplay of finite temperature and disorder. Within the

the contrast of the image in ultrasound imaging. These microbubbles consist of
a gas core encapsulated by a layer of protein or lipid to stabilize them
against early dissolution in the bloodstream. Contrast agents, in the presence
of ultrasound, can also help facilitate the uptake of drugs and genes in to
desired cells through the process called sonoporation. Sonoporation is the
temporarily rupture of cell membranes in the presence of ultrasound. In this
work, we have studied the contrast agent near a rigid wall (assumed as a cell
membrane with high elastic modulus) in the presence of ultrasound using
boundary element method. The contrast agent forms non-symmetrical high velocity
microjet at the last stage of the collapse phase. The microjet and the adjacent
surrounding fluid move toward the rigid wall with a very high velocity. This
high velocity fluid impinges the wall and spreads radially along it. This will
generate high velocity gradient on the wall which gives rise to shear stress
resulting in the perforation of cell membrane. The encapsulation of the
microbubble can be assumed as an interface with an infinitesimal thickness.
There are several models to simulate the interface. In this study, the
encapsulation is simulated with two models; viscoelastic model with
exponentially varying elasticity (EEM) and Marmottant model. In this research,
we have studied the effect of different parameters on the dynamics of the
contrast microbubble, the induced shear stress on the wall due to its collapse,
and the velocity and pressure fields surrounding the contrast microbubble, to
better understand sonoporation.

vulnerabilities in these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as

delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are
written in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped

Furthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security

independence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a
combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this work, we identified
various mistakes and imprecisions in existing semantics and verification tools

Specifically, we consider the setting where a codeword over some finite
alphabet of size $q$ may suffer from $\delta$ fraction of adversarial deletions
and $\gamma$ fraction of adversarial insertions. A code is said to be
$L$-list-decodable if there is an (efficient) algorithm that, given a received
word, reports a list of $L$ codewords that include the original codeword.
  Using the concept of synchronization strings, introduced by the first two
authors [STOC 2017], we show some surprising results. We show that for every
$0\leq\delta<1$, every $0\leq\gamma<\infty$ and every $\epsilon>0$ there exist
efficient codes of rate $1-\delta-\epsilon$ and constant alphabet (so
$q=O_{\delta,\gamma,\epsilon}(1)$) and sub-logarithmic list sizes. We stress
that the fraction of insertions can be arbitrarily large and the rate is
independent of this parameter. Our result sheds light on the remarkable
asymmetry between the impact of insertions and deletions from the point of view
of error-correction: Whereas deletions cost in the rate of the code, insertion
costs are borne by the adversary and not the code!
  We also prove several tight bounds on the parameters of list-decodable insdel
codes. In particular, we show that the alphabet size of insdel codes needs to
be exponentially large in $\epsilon^{-1}$, where $\epsilon$ is the gap to
capacity above. Our result even applies to settings where the unique-decoding
capacity equals the list-decoding capacity and when it does so, it shows that
the alphabet size needs to be exponentially large in the gap to capacity. This
is sharp contrast to the Hamming error model where alphabet size polynomial in
$\epsilon^{-1}$ suffices for unique decoding and also shows that the
exponential dependence on the alphabet size in previous works that constructed
insdel codes is actually necessary!

evolution, or due to a dynamical process which rapidly brings the NS into the
primary star. The ejecta can reach velocities of 10,000 km/s despite not being
a supernova, and might explain such velocities in the 2011 outburst of the
luminous blue variable progenitor of SN 2009ip. The typical transient duration
and kinetic energy are weeks to months, and up to approximately 1 foe,
respectively. The interaction of a NS with a giant envelope might be a phase in
the evolution of the progenitors of most NS-NS binary systems that later
undergo a merger event. If the NS spirals in all the way to the core of the
primary star and brings about its complete disruption we term this a `common

and the operator splitting approach to solving PDEs. In particular, we show
that a proximal version of the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm corresponds to a
scheme that alternates between solving the gradient flows of two specific

derive some new non-asymptotic results on the convergence properties of this

calls for regulatory mechanisms and algorithms to combat bias and inequality.
Algorithmically, bandit optimization has enjoyed great success in learning user
preferences and personalizing content or feeds accordingly. We propose an
algorithmic framework that allows for the possibility to control bias or
discrimination in such bandit-based personalization. Our model allows for the
specification of general fairness constraints on the sensitive types of the
content that can be displayed to a user. The challenge, however, is to come up
with a scalable and low regret algorithm for the constrained optimization
problem that arises. Our main technical contribution is a provably fast and
low-regret algorithm for the fairness-constrained bandit optimization problem.
Our proofs crucially leverage the special structure of our problem. Experiments
on synthetic and real-world data sets show that our algorithmic framework can
control bias with only a minor loss to revenue.

and often conflicting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. The resultant
solutions may be included by the Pareto Front under the concept of Pareto
Optimality. However, the problem of finding all the Pareto-optimal routes in
WMHNs is classified as NP-hard, since the number of legitimate routes increases
exponentially, as the nodes proliferate. Quantum Computing offers an attractive
framework of rendering the Pareto-optimal routing problem tractable. In this
context, a pair of quantum-assisted algorithms have been proposed, namely the
Non-Dominated Quantum Optimization (NDQO) and the Non-Dominated Quantum
Iterative Optimization (NDQIO). However, their complexity is proportional to
$\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ corresponds to the total number of legitimate routes,
thus still failing to find the solutions in ""polynomial time"". As a remedy, we
devise a dynamic programming framework and propose the so-called Evolutionary
Quantum Pareto Optimization (EQPO) algorithm. We analytically characterize the
complexity imposed by the EQPO algorithm and demonstrate that it succeeds in
solving the Pareto-optimal routing problem in polynomial time. Finally, we
demonstrate by simulations that the EQPO algorithm achieves a complexity
reduction, which is at least an order of magnitude, when compared to its
predecessors, albeit at the cost of a modest heuristic accuracy reduction.

to test the controllers in simulation. To be able to do this, we need to

adversarial counter examples that violate the safety specifications. These
specifications are defined as complex boolean combinations of smooth functions

expressive and impose hard constraints on the system. In our framework, we
exploit regularity assumptions on individual functions in form of a Gaussian

time. Contrary to the well established behavior for shorter rotation periods
and smaller Rossby numbers, the chromospheric activity of the more slowly
rotating stars of M67 was found to increase with increasing Rossby number. Such
behavior has never been reported before, although it was theoretically
predicted to emerge as a consequence of antisolar differential rotation (DR)

models the absolute value of the DR was found to exceed that for solar-like DR.
Using gyrochronological relations and an approximate age of 4 Gyr for the

preliminary indications that the frequency of gas giants is as high as those

of $M_{\nu}<0.19\, {\rm eV}$. This limit represents a significant improvement
over previous bounds with comparable datasets. Our method will prove especially
powerful and important as future large-scale structure surveys will overlap
more significantly with the CMB lensing kernel providing a large
cross-correlation signal.

significant quantities of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) such as 60Fe and
26Al (with half-lives of 2.6 and 0.7 Myr respectively) produced in supernova
explosions and in the Wolf-Rayet winds that precede them. Proposed explanations
for the high SLR abundance include formation of the Sun in a
supernova-triggered collapse or in a giant molecular cloud (GMC) that was
massive enough to survive multiple supernovae (SNe) and confine their ejecta.
However, the former scenario is possible only if the Sun is a rare outlier
among massive stars, while the latter appears to be inconsistent with the
observation that 26Al is distributed with a scale height significantly larger
than GMCs. In this paper, we present a high-resolution chemo-hydrodynamical
simulation of the entire Milky-Way Galaxy, including stochastic star formation,
HII regions, SNe, and element injection, that allows us to measure for the
distribution of 60Fe/56Fe and 26Al/27Al ratios over all stars in the Galaxy. We
show that the Solar System's abundance ratios are well within the normal range,
but that SLRs originate neither from triggering nor from confinement in
long-lived clouds as previously conjectured. Instead, we find that SLRs are
abundant in newborn stars because star formation is correlated on galactic
scales, so that ejecta preferentially enrich atomic gas that will subsequently
be accreted onto existing GMCs or will form new ones. Thus new generations of
stars preferentially form in patches of the Galaxy contaminated by previous
generations of stellar winds and supernovae.

their theoretical calculation is a challenging problem, even for exactly

measuring higher order correlations. Here we compute correlation functions of
the quantum sine-Gordon model, a prototype integrable model of central interest
from both theoretical and experimental points of view. Building upon the
so-called Truncated Conformal Space Approach, we numerically construct higher
order correlations in a system of finite size in various physical states of
experimental relevance, both in and out of equilibrium. We measure deviations
from Gaussianity due to the presence of interaction and analyse their
dependence on temperature, explaining the experimentally observed crossover
between Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. We find that correlations of excited
states are markedly different from the thermal case, which can be explained by
the integrability of the system. We also study dynamics after a quench,
observing the effects of the interaction on the time evolution of correlation
functions, their spatial dependence, and their non-Gaussianity as measured by
the kurtosis.

Jupiter's stratosphere. The IR spectrum recorded by Cassini/CIRS during the
Jupiter flyby contains the fingerprints of several atmospheric compounds and
allows probing its atmospheric composition. C2H2 and C2H6, the main compounds
produced by methane photochemistry, were retrieved as a function of latitude at
certain pressure levels. CIRS observations suggest a different meridional
distribution for these two species, difficult to reconcile with their
photochemical histories, which are thought to be coupled to the methane
photolysis. While the C2H2 abundance decreases with latitude, C2H6 becomes more
abundant at high latitudes. A new 2D (latitude-altitude) seasonal photochemical
model is developed to study whether the addition of stratospheric transport
processes, such as meridional diffusion and advection, can explain the
latitudinal behavior of C2H2 and C2H6. C2H2 observations are fairly well
reproduced without meridional diffusion. Adding meridional diffusion to the
model provides an improved agreement with the C2H6 observations by flattening
its meridional distribution, but degrades the fit to the C2H2 distribution.
Meridional diffusion alone cannot produce the observed increase with latitude
of C2H6. When adding advective transport between 30 mbar and 0.01 mbar, with
upwelling winds at the equator and downwelling winds at high latitudes, we can
reproduce the C2H6 abundance increase with latitude. However, the fit to the
C2H2 distribution is degraded. The strength of the advective winds needed to
reproduce the C2H6 abundances is very sensitive to the value of the meridional
eddy diffusion coefficient. The coupled fate of C2H2 and C2H6 suggests that an
additional process is missing in the model. Ion-neutral chemistry was not
accounted for in this work and might be a good candidate to solve this issue.

quantum gravity, when venturing to large distances in scalar field space, a
tower of particles will become light at a rate that is exponential in the field
space distance. We provide a novel viewpoint on this claim: if we assume that a
tower of states becomes light near a particular point in field space, and we
further demand that loop corrections drive both gravity and the scalar to
strong coupling at a common energy scale, then the requirement that the
particles become light exponentially fast in the field-space distance in Planck
units follows automatically. Furthermore, the same assumption of a common
strong-coupling scale for scalar fields and gravitons implies that when a
scalar field evolves over a super-Planckian distance, the average particle mass
changes by an amount of order the cutoff energy. This supports earlier
suggestions that significantly super-Planckian excursions in field space cannot
be described within a single effective field theory. We comment on the
relationship of our results to the Weak Gravity Conjecture.

spin-exchange between localized impurities with quasi-spin $F_i=3$ and bath
atoms with $F_b=1$ is resolved. Comparing our data to numerical simulations of
spin dynamics we find that, for gas densities in the BEC regime, the dynamics
is dominated by the condensed fraction of the cloud. We spatially resolve the
density overlap of impurities and gas by the spin-population of impurities.
Finally we trace the coherence of impurities prepared in a coherent
superposition of internal states when coupled to a gas of different densities.
For our choice of states we show that, despite high bath densities and thus
fast thermalization rates, the impurity coherence is not affected by the bath,
realizing a regime of sympathetic cooling while maintaining internal state
coherence. Our work paves the way toward non-destructive probing of quantum

solid are extremely complex. They involve a huge number of elementary processes
in the plasma, in the solid as well as charge, momentum and energy transfer
across the interface. In the majority of plasma simulations these surface
processes are either neglected or treated via phenomenological parameters.
However, those parameters are known only in some cases, so such an approach is
very inaccurate and does not have predictive capability. Therefore,
improvements are highly needed. In this paper we briefly summarize relevant
theoretical methods from solid state and surface physics that are able to
contribute to an improved simulation of plasma-surface interaction in the near
future. Full \textit{ab initio} quantum simulations are feasible only for
extremely short times and/or small system sizes. A substantial simplification
is achieved when electronic quantum effects are not treated explicitly. Then
one arrives at semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the heavy
particles that have become the main workhorse in surface science simulations.
Using microscopically founded potentials and force fields as an input, these MD
simulations approach the quality of \textit{ab initio} simulations, in many
cases. However, despite their simplified nature, these simulations require a
time step that is of the order or below one femtosecond making it prohibitive
to reach experimentally relevant scales of minutes. To bridge this gap in
length and time scales without compromising the first principles character of
the simulations, many physical and computational strategies have been put
forward in surface science. This paper presents a brief overview on different
methods and their underlying physical ideas, and we compare their strengths and
weaknesses.

learns on a suite of nonparametric morphology indicators widely used for
automated morphologies. We develop a decision engine that delegates tasks

transportation systems in a smart city. An accurate prediction model can help
the city pre-allocate resources to meet travel demand and to reduce empty taxis
on streets which waste energy and worsen the traffic congestion. With the
increasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing
(in China), we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously.
How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting
and critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly
rely on time series forecasting techniques, which fail to model the complex
non-linear spatial and temporal relations. Recent advances in deep learning
have shown superior performance on traditionally challenging tasks such as
image classification by learning the complex features and correlations from
large-scale data. This breakthrough has inspired researchers to explore deep
learning techniques on traffic prediction problems. However, existing methods
on traffic prediction have only considered spatial relation (e.g., using CNN)
or temporal relation (e.g., using LSTM) independently. We propose a Deep
Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial
and temporal relations. Specifically, our proposed model consists of three
views: temporal view (modeling correlations between future demand values with
near time points via LSTM), spatial view (modeling local spatial correlation
via local CNN), and semantic view (modeling correlations among regions sharing
similar temporal patterns). Experiments on large-scale real taxi demand data
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.

submillimetre provides choice diagnostics to constrain the properties of this
magnetized turbulence. We aim to constrain these properties in a statistical
way, focusing in particular on the power spectral index of the turbulent
component of the interstellar magnetic field in a diffuse molecular cloud, the
Polaris Flare. We present an analysis framework which is based on simulating
polarized thermal dust emission maps using model dust density (proportional to
gas density) and magnetic field cubes, integrated along the line of sight, and
comparing these statistically to actual data. The model fields are derived from
fBm processes, which allow a precise control of their one- and two-point
statistics. We explore the nine-dimensional parameter space of these models
through a MCMC analysis, which yields best-fitting parameters and associated
uncertainties. We find that the power spectrum of the turbulent component of
the magnetic field in the Polaris Flare molecular cloud scales with wavenumber
as a power law with a spectral index $2.8\pm 0.2$. It complements a uniform
field whose norm in the POS is approximately twice the norm of the fluctuations
of the turbulent component. The density field is well represented by a
log-normally distributed field with a mean gas density $40\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$
and a power spectrum with as spectral index $1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$. The agreement
between the Planck data and the simulated maps for these best-fitting

Researchers at UAB have devised a custom device to measure scleral strain
continuously around the eye under fixed levels of IOP, which here is used to
assess how strain varies around the posterior pole, with IOP, and across
glaucoma risk factors such as age. The hypothesis is that scleral strain
decreases with age, which could alter biomechanics of the optic nerve head and
cause damage that could eventually lead to glaucoma. To evaluate this
hypothesis, we adapted Bayesian Functional Mixed Models to model these complex
data consisting of correlated functions on spherical scleral surface, with
nonparametric age effects allowed to vary in magnitude and smoothness across
the scleral surface, multi-level random effect functions to capture
within-subject correlation, and functional growth curve terms to capture serial
correlation across IOPs that can vary around the scleral surface. Our method
yields fully Bayesian inference on the scleral surface or any aggregation or
transformation thereof, and reveals interesting insights into the biomechanical
etiology of glaucoma. The general modeling framework described is very flexible

significantly more expressive than Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
as they support operations that can conflict with each other. Introducing
conflicting operations typically brings the need to block an operation in at
least some executions, leading to difficulties in programming and reasoning
about correctness, as well as potential inefficiencies in implementation.
  The salient aspect of CARDs is that they allow ease of programming and
reasoning about programs comparable to CRDTs, while enabling algorithmic
inference of conflicts so that an operation is blocked only when necessary. The
key idea is to have a language that allows associating with each operation a
two-state predicate called {\em consistency guard} that relates the state of
the replica on which the operation is executing to a global state (which is
never computed). The consistency guards bring three advantages. First, a
programmer developing an operation needs only to choose a consistency guard
that states what the operation will rely on. In particular, they do not need to
consider the operation conflicts with other operation. This allows purely {\em
modular reasoning}. Second, we show that consistency guard allow reducing the
complexity of reasoning needed to prove invariants that hold as CARD operations
are executing. The reason is that consistency guard allow reducing the
reasoning about concurrency among operations to purely {\em sequential

source domain to learn an accurate model in a target domain where labels are
scarce or unavailable. A recent approach for finding a common representation of
the two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015),
which attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target
feature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial
training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function
has high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2)
in non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform
well in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on
the source domain hurts performance on the target domain. In this paper, we
address these issues through the lens of the cluster assumption, i.e., decision
boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and
related models: 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model,
which combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes
the violation the cluster assumption; 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative
Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T) model, which takes the VADA model
as initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the
cluster assumption violation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the
combination of these two models significantly improve the state-of-the-art
performance on the digit, traffic sign, and Wi-Fi recognition domain adaptation
benchmarks.

provably sample every graphlet with positive probability and can sample
graphlets of arbitrary size $k$. We outline variants of lifted graphlet counts,

unbiased for the true graphlet count and have a controlled variance for all

  equations of bistable type",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the existence and spectral stability of traveling fronts
for nonlinear hyperbolic equations with a positive ""damping"" term and a
reaction function of bistable type. Particular cases of the former include the
relaxed Allen-Cahn equation and the nonlinear version of the telegrapher's
equation with bistable reaction term. The existence theory of the fronts is
revisited, yielding useful properties such as exponential decay to the
asymptotic rest states and a variational formula for the unique wave speed. The
spectral problem associated to the linearized equation around the front is
established. It is shown that the spectrum of the perturbation problem is
stable, that is, it is located in the complex half plane with negative real
part, with the exception of the eigenvalue zero associated to translation
invariance, which is isolated and simple. In this fashion, it is shown that
there exists an spectral gap precluding the accumulation of essential spectrum
near the origin. To show that the point spectrum is stable we introduce a
transformation of the eigenfunctions that allows to employ energy estimates in
the frequency regime. This method produces a new proof of equivalent results
for the relaxed Allen-Cahn case and extends the former to a wider class of
equations. This result is a first step in a more general program pertaining to
the nonlinear stability of the fronts under small perturbations, a problem
which remains open.

spatial reasoning and path planning for autonomous and highly-automated

objects (vehicles), capable of accepting object proposals from different sensor
modalities (vision and range) and a variable number of sensors, to produce
continuous object tracks. This work is a generalization of the MDP framework
for MOT, with some key extensions - First, we track objects across multiple
cameras and across different sensor modalities. This is done by fusing object
proposals across sensors accurately and efficiently. Second, the objects of
interest (targets) are tracked directly in the real world. This is a departure
from traditional techniques where objects are simply tracked in the image
plane. Doing so allows the tracks to be readily used by an autonomous agent for
navigation and related tasks.
  To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we test it on real world highway
data collected from a heavily sensorized testbed capable of capturing
full-surround information. We demonstrate that our framework is well-suited to
track objects through entire maneuvers around the ego-vehicle, some of which
take more than a few minutes to complete. We also leverage the modularity of
our approach by comparing the effects of including/excluding different sensors,
changing the total number of sensors, and the quality of object proposals on

functions of the agents might correspond to different tasks, and are only known
to the corresponding agent. Moreover, each agent makes individual decisions
based on both the information observed locally and the messages received from
its neighbors over the network. Within this setting, the collective goal of the
agents is to maximize the globally averaged return over the network through
exchanging information with their neighbors. To this end, we propose two
decentralized actor-critic algorithms with function approximation, which are
applicable to large-scale MARL problems where both the number of states and the
number of agents are massively large. Under the decentralized structure, the
actor step is performed individually by each agent with no need to infer the
policies of others. For the critic step, we propose a consensus update via

individual-level behavioral-clinical phenotypes that relate personal biomarkers
and behavioral traits in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) self-monitoring data. Materials
and Methods: We used hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify groups of meals
with similar nutrition and glycemic impact for 6 individuals with T2DM who
collected self-monitoring data. We evaluated clusters on: 1) correspondence to
gold standards generated by certified diabetes educators (CDEs) for 3
participants; 2) face validity, rated by CDEs, and 3) impact on CDEs' ability
to identify patterns for another 3 participants. Results: Gold standard (GS)
included 9 patterns across 3 participants. Of these, all 9 were re-discovered
using HC: 4 GS patterns were consistent with patterns identified by HC (over
50% of meals in a cluster followed the pattern); another 5 were included as
sub-groups in broader clusers. 50% (9/18) of clusters were rated over 3 on
5-point Likert scale for validity, significance, and being actionable. After
reviewing clusters, CDEs identified patterns that were more consistent with
data (70% reduction in contradictions between patterns and participants'
records). Discussion: Hierarchical clustering of blood glucose and
macronutrient consumption appears suitable for discovering behavioral-clinical
phenotypes in T2DM. Most clusters corresponded to gold standard and were rated
positively by CDEs for face validity. Cluster visualizations helped CDEs
identify more robust patterns in nutrition and glycemic impact, creating new
possibilities for visual analytic solutions. Conclusion: Machine learning
methods can use diabetes self-monitoring data to create personalized

descent (SGD) navigates the loss landscape of over-parametrized deep neural
networks (DNNs). These observations expose the qualitatively different roles of
learning rate and batch-size in DNN optimization and generalization.
Specifically we study the DNN loss surface along the trajectory of SGD by
interpolating the loss surface between parameters from consecutive
\textit{iterations} and tracking various metrics during training. We find that
the loss interpolation between parameters before and after each training
iteration's update is roughly convex with a minimum (\textit{valley floor}) in
between for most of the training. Based on this and other metrics, we deduce
that for most of the training update steps, SGD moves in valley like regions of
the loss surface by jumping from one valley wall to another at a height above
the valley floor. This 'bouncing between walls at a height' mechanism helps SGD
traverse larger distance for small batch sizes and large learning rates which
we find play qualitatively different roles in the dynamics. While a large
learning rate maintains a large height from the valley floor, a small batch
size injects noise facilitating exploration. We find this mechanism is crucial
for generalization because the valley floor has barriers and this exploration
above the valley floor allows SGD to quickly travel far away from the
initialization point (without being affected by barriers) and find flatter
regions, corresponding to better generalization.

addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with
minimal assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to generate graphs
by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph
generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on
the graph structure generated so far.
  In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of GraphRNN, we introduce
a benchmark suite of datasets, baselines and novel evaluation metrics based on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy, which measure distances between sets of graphs. Our
experiments show that GraphRNN significantly outperforms all baselines,
learning to generate diverse graphs that match the structural characteristics
of a target set, while also scaling to graphs 50 times larger than previous
deep models.

difficult to provide traditional fiber backhaul access to each cell site, which

of millimeter wave (mm-wave) communication has opened up the possibility of
providing high-speed wireless backhaul to such cell sites. Since mm-wave is
also suitable for access links, the third generation partnership project (3GPP)
is envisioning an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architecture for the
fifth generation (5G) cellular networks in which the same infrastructure and
spectral resources will be used for both access and backhaul. In this paper, we
develop an analytical framework for IAB-enabled cellular network using which
its downlink rate coverage probability is accurately characterized. Using this
framework, we study the performance of three backhaul bandwidth (BW) partition
strategies: 1) equal partition: when all SBSs obtain equal share of the
backhaul BW; 2) instantaneous load-based partition: when the backhaul BW share
of an SBS is proportional to its instantaneous load; and 3) average load-based
partition: when the backhaul BW share of an SBS is proportional to its average
load. Our analysis shows that depending on the choice of the partition
strategy, there exists an optimal split of access and backhaul BW for which the
rate coverage is maximized. Further, there exists a critical volume of
cell-load (total number of users) beyond which the gains provided by the
IAB-enabled network disappear and its performance converges to that of the
traditional macro-only network with no SBSs.

that generates class-semantic color-texture textons and aggregates superpixel
based texton occurrences for vegetation segmentation in natural roadside
images. Pixel-level class-semantic textons are first learnt by generating two
individual sets of bag-of-word visual dictionaries from color and filter-bank
texture features separately for each object class using manually cropped
training data. For a testing image, it is first oversegmented into a set of
homogeneous superpixels. The color and texture features of all pixels in each
superpixel are extracted and further mapped to one of the learnt textons using
the nearest distance metric, resulting in a color and a texture texton
occurrence matrix. The color and texture texton occurrences are aggregated
using a linear mixing method over each superpixel and the segmentation is
finally achieved using a simple yet effective majority voting strategy.
Evaluations on two public image datasets from videos collected by the
Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR), Queensland, Australia, and a
public roadside grass dataset show high accuracy of the proposed approach. We
also demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for vegetation segmentation

moreover, complete avoidance of the breaking in a photonic waveguide of a
subwavelength width. The analysis is based on the Maxwell's equations, instead
of the usual paraxial approximation. Next, we review a recently proposed
possibility to construct stable one-dimensional (1D) PT-symmetric solitons in a
paraxial model with arbitrarily large values of the gain-loss coefficient,
provided that the self-trapping of the solitons is induced by self-defocusing
cubic nonlinearity, whose local strength grows sufficiently fast from the
center to periphery. The model admits a particular analytical solution for the
fundamental soliton, and provides full stability for families of fundamental

PT-symmetric solitons in 2D extensions of the 1D model: one with a quasi-1D
modulation profile of the local gain-loss coefficient, and another with the
fully-2D modulation. These settings admit particular analytical solutions for
2D solitons, while generic soliton families are found in a numerical form. The
quasi-1D modulation profile gives rise to a stable family of single-peak 2D

effectively tackle unconstrained many-objective optimization problems. In the
proposed algorithm, \emph{diversity repairing mechanism} is utilized to mend
the areas where need non-dominated solutions with a closer proximity to the
Pareto-optimal front. Then \emph{favorable solutions} are generated by the
model built from the regularity of the solutions surrounding a group of
representatives. These two steps collectively enhance the selection pressure
which gives rise to the superior convergence of the proposed algorithm. In
addition, dimension reduction technique is employed in the decision space to
speed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm. Finally, by assigning
the Pareto-optimal solutions to the uniformly distributed reference vectors, a
set of solutions with excellent diversity and convergence is obtained. To
measure the performance, NSGA-III, GrEA, MOEA/D, HypE, MBN-EDA, and RM-MEDA are
selected to perform comparison experiments over DTLZ and DTLZ$^-$ test suites
with $3$-, $5$-, $8$-, $10$-, and $15$-objective. Experimental results
quantified by the selected performance metrics reveal that the proposed
algorithm shows considerable competitiveness in addressing unconstrained
many-objective optimization problems.

such, it is subject to two sets of constraints: topological constraints on the
structure and process constraints on the physical process over this structure.
To perform image generation we need to define a mapping from a porous medium to

highly-parallel kernels executed on GPU. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
the most popular optimization method for model training implemented extensively
on modern data analytics platforms. While the data-intensive properties of SGD
are well-known, there is an intense debate on which of the many SGD variants is
better in practice. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of parallel
SGD for training generalized linear models. We consider the impact of three
factors -- computing architecture (multi-core CPU or GPU), synchronous or
asynchronous model updates, and data sparsity -- on three measures---hardware
efficiency, statistical efficiency, and time to convergence. In the process, we
design an optimized asynchronous SGD algorithm for GPU that leverages warp
shuffling and cache coalescing for data and model access. We draw several
interesting findings from our extensive experiments with logistic regression
(LR) and support vector machines (SVM) on five real datasets. For synchronous
SGD, GPU always outperforms parallel CPU---they both outperform a sequential
CPU solution by more than 400X. For asynchronous SGD, parallel CPU is the
safest choice while GPU with data replication is better in certain situations.
The choice between synchronous GPU and asynchronous CPU depends on the task and
the characteristics of the data. As a reference, our best implementation
outperforms TensorFlow and BIDMach consistently. We hope that our insights
provide a useful guide for applying parallel SGD to generalized linear models.

in accuracy and speed for single image super-resolution. However, as the depth
of network grows, the information flow is weakened and the training becomes
harder and harder. On the other hand, most of the models adopt a single-stream
structure with which integrating complementary contextual information under
different receptive fields is difficult. To improve information flow and to
capture sufficient knowledge for reconstructing the high-frequency details, we
propose a cascaded multi-scale cross network (CMSC) in which a sequence of
subnetworks is cascaded to infer high resolution features in a coarse-to-fine
manner. In each cascaded subnetwork, we stack multiple multi-scale cross (MSC)
modules to fuse complementary multi-scale information in an efficient way as
well as to improve information flow across the layers. Meanwhile, by
introducing residual-features learning in each stage, the relative information
between high-resolution and low-resolution features is fully utilized to
further boost reconstruction performance. We train the proposed network with
cascaded-supervision and then assemble the intermediate predictions of the
cascade to achieve high quality image reconstruction. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets illustrate the superiority of
our proposed method over state-of-the-art super-resolution methods.

in particular, thermal hydraulic processes, in various media of fractal
structure of the natural, technological and technical systems and devices. The
examples of a few complex systems (mainly, the physical processes) are shown as
the different fractal structures, e.g. the ones obtained by cooling and
solidification of the multiphase mixtures. Some materials reveal the structural
features having a significant influence on the behaviors of these materials.
The thermal hydraulic processes which are going during a melts cooling, with
the further water and steam flow through a porous or a channeled media, are
presenting the characteristic examples. The best models of the thermal
hydraulic and other physical processes in such fractal media should be the ones
based on the fractional differential equations. An order of the fractional
derivatives in time and space may change in the process. For example, by a
cooling of a melt, with a change of the fractal properties of the system, it is
going as follows: first, the vapor, water, melt mixture is interacting, then a
formation of the solid structure is performing due to solidification of a melt,
and a vapor flows through the permeable structure developed in a process. The
dynamically changing fractal systems (dynamic fractals) must be modeled by the
corresponding equations changing according to the evolving process. Therefore,
it is not surprising that so far some of such tasks have not been properly
resolved even in a simplified formulation. There are many similar problems in
the modern physics, technology, etc., which are discussed in the paper.

proper-orthogonal-decomposition (CPOD) technique was developed to establish a
physics-based surrogate (emulation) model for prediction of mean flowfields and
design exploration over a wide parameter space. The CPOD technique is
substantially improved upon here using a kernel-smoothed POD (KSPOD) technique,
which leverages kriging-based weighted functions from the design matrix. The
resultant emulation model is then trained using a dataset obtained through
high-fidelity simulations. As an example, the flow evolution in a swirl
injector is considered for a wide range of design parameters and operating
conditions. The KSPOD-based emulation model performs well, and can faithfully
capture the spatiotemporal flow dynamics. The model enables effective design
surveys utilizing high-fidelity simulation data, achieving a turnaround time
for evaluating new design points that is 42,000 times faster than the original

roots of the domain shift we significantly reduce the number of parameters of
the architecture to tune, we gain the flexibility necessary to deal with subset

demonstrated in heterostructures with four channels obtained by combining a

expected to yield advanced transmission and absorption regimes. Various
configurations are analyzed, which are distinguished in symmetry properties and

mixing are discussed. The simplest two-component configurations with broadband
mixing are found, as well as the more complex three-component configurations
wherein symmetric and broken sets are not yet mixed and appear in the

strong selection on the adaptive immune system, the characteristics of the
somatic evolution that shape the immune response are still unknown. Traditional
population genetics methods fail to distinguish chronic immune response from
healthy repertoire evolution. Here, we infer the evolutionary modes of B-cell
repertoires and identify complex dynamics with a constant production of better
B-cell receptor mutants that compete, maintaining large clonal diversity and
potentially slowing down adaptation. A substantial fraction of mutations that
rise to high frequencies in pathogen engaging CDRs of B-cell receptors (BCRs)
are beneficial, in contrast to many such changes in structurally relevant
frameworks that are deleterious and circulate by hitchhiking. We identify a
pattern where BCRs in patients who experience larger viral expansions undergo
stronger selection with a rapid turnover of beneficial mutations due to clonal
interference in their CDR3 regions. Using population genetics modeling, we show
that the extinction of these beneficial mutations can be attributed to the rise
of competing beneficial alleles and clonal interference. The picture is of a
dynamic repertoire, where better clones may be outcompeted by new mutants

that generates continuous motion of the robots on the wires is proposed. This
is realized by means of a Continuous Onto Wires (COW) map: the robots'

mode counting and anomaly cancellation in F-theory vacua.
  The major part of this thesis focuses on zero mode counting. We explain that
elements of Chow group describe a subset of gauge backgrounds and give rise to
a line bundle on each matter curve. The sheaf cohomologies of these line
bundles are found to encode the chiral and anti-chiral localised zero modes in
this compactification. Therefore, it is of prime interest to compute these
sheaf cohomologies. Unfortunately, the line bundles in question are in general
non-pullback line bundles. In particular, this is the case for the hypercharge
flux employed in F-theory models of grand unified theories (GUTs).
Consequently, existing methods, such as the cohomCalg-algorithm, cannot be
applied. In collaboration with the mathematician Mohamed Barakat, we have
therefore implemented algorithms which determine the sheaf cohomologies of all
coherent sheaves on toric varieties. These algorithms are provided by the
gap-package SheafCohomologiesOnToricVarieties which extends the homalg-project
of Mohamed Barakat. We exemplify these algorithms in explicit (toy-)models of
F-theory GUTs.
  As a spin-off of this analysis, we proved that in an entire class of F-theory
vacua, the matter surface fluxes satisfy a number of relations in the Chow
ring, which we related to anomaly cancellation. Based on this evidence we
conjecture that the well-known anomaly cancellation conditions in F-theory -
typically phrased as intersections in the cohomology ring - can be extended
even to relations in the Chow ring.

limit, our model reduces to the equilibrium $XY$ model with quenched disorder,
while for the clean system, it is similar to the Vicsek model for polar flock.
We note that a small amount of the quenched rotators destroys the long-range
order usually noted in the clean SPPs. The system shows a quasi-long range
order state upto some moderate density of the rotators. On further increment in
the density of rotators, the system shows a continuous transition from the

Our linearized hydrodynamic calculation predicts anisotropic higher order

Gapless materials such as noble metals can be used for harvesting the whole

photo-generated non-equilibrium or hot charge carriers can be harvested before
they thermalize with the crystal lattice via the process of their internal
photo-emission (IPE) through the rectifying Schottky junction with a
semiconductor. However, the low efficiency and the high cost of noble metals
necessitates the search for cheaper abundant alternative materials, and we show
here that carbon can serve as a promising IPE material candidate. We compare
the upper limits of performance of IPE photon energy-harvesting platforms,
which incorporate either gold or carbon as the photoactive material where hot
electrons are generated. Through a combination of density functional theory,
joint electron density of states calculations, and Schottky diode efficiency
modeling, we show that the material electron band structure imposes a strict
upper limit on the achievable efficiency of the IPE devices. Our calculations
reveal that graphite is a good material candidate for the IPE absorber for
harvesting visible and near-infrared photons. Graphite electron density of
states yields a sizeable population of hot electrons with energies high enough
to be collected across the potential barrier. We also discuss the mechanisms
that prevent the IPE device efficiency from reaching the upper limits imposed
by their material electron band structures. The proposed approach is general

a function of incident direction, time, altitude, as well as latitude and

of the flux of secondaries at ground level is implemented by using the CORSIKA

a more realistic description of the atmospheric and geomagnetic response in
these complex regions of the rigidity space. As an example of our calculation

thinner than or (2) thicker than the size of the Galaxy, corresponding to

shell wall has a thickness smaller than the size of the Galaxy and intersects
the galactic plane in a donut shape (annulus) that fills only a fraction of the

walls may still fill our Galaxy, and indeed may overlap locally, given a
sufficiently high birthrate of detectable civilizations. In the second case,
each radiation shell is thicker than the size of our Galaxy. Yet, the ensemble
of walls may or may not yield a SETI detection depending on the civilization
birthrate. We compare the number of different electromagnetic transmissions
arriving at Earth to Drake's $N$, the number of currently emitting
civilizations, showing that they are equal to each other for both cases (1) and
(2). However, for $L < 100,000$ years, the transmissions arriving at Earth may
come from distant civilizations long extinct, while civilizations still alive

net bottomonium suppression in terms of survival probability under the combined

anomaly at low temperatures, arising from a suppression of the quantum
corrections due to weak localization and electron interactions. A simple
rescaling of these data, free of any adjustable parameters, shows that this
anomaly exhibits a universal, temperature- ($T$) independent form. According to
this, the differential conductance is approximately constant at small voltages
($V<k_BT/e$), while at larger voltages it increases logarithmically with the
applied bias, reflecting a quenching of the quantum corrections. For
theoretical insight into the origins of this behavior, we formulate a model for
weak-localization in the presence of nonlinear transport. According to this,
the voltage applied under nonequilibrium induces unavoidable dephasing, arising
from a self-averaging of the diffusing electron waves responsible for
transport. By establishing the manner in which the quantum corrections are

  Model",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the parameter estimation problem for a multi-timescale
adaptive threshold (MAT) neuronal model is investigated. By manipulating the
system dynamics, which comprise of a non-resetting leaky integrator coupled
with an adaptive threshold, the threshold voltage can be obtained as a
realizable model that is linear in the unknown parameters. This linearly
parametrized realizable model is then utilized inside a prediction error based
framework to identify the threshold parameters with the purpose of predicting
single neuron precise firing times. The iterative linear least squares
estimation scheme is evaluated using both synthetic data obtained from an exact
model as well as experimental data obtained from in vitro rat somatosensory
cortical neurons. Results show the ability of this approach to fit the MAT
model to different types of fluctuating reference data. The performance of the
proposed approach is seen to be superior when comparing with existing
identification approaches used by the neuronal community.

investigate the physical-mathematical similitudes of the spectroscopic and beta
decay Fermi theories. Both theories were formulated using quantum perturbative
theory that allowed obtaining equations whose algebraic structure and physical
interpretation suggest that the two phenomena occur according to the same
mechanism. Fermi, therefore, could have guessed well in advance of the times
that the two theories could be unified into a single physical-mathematical
model that led to different results depending on the considered energy. The
electroweak unification found its full realization only in the 1960s within the
Standard Model that, however, is mainly based on a mathematical approach.
Retracing the reasoning made by Fermi facilitates the understanding of the
physical foundations that underlie the unification of the electromagnetic and
weak forces.
