  Corresponding Author: Kai Xu (kevin.kai.xu@gmail.com)","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2018",,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In view-based 3D shape recognition, extracting discriminative visual
representation of 3D shapes from projected images is considered the core
problem. Projections with low discriminative ability can adversely influence
the final 3D shape representation. Especially under the real situations with
background clutter and object occlusion, the adverse effect is even more
severe. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel deep neural network, View
Discerning Network, which learns to judge the quality of views and adjust their
contributions to the representation of shapes. In this network, a Score
Generation Unit is devised to evaluate the quality of each projected image with
score vectors. These score vectors are used to weight the image features and
the weighted features perform much better than original features in 3D shape
recognition task. In particular, we introduce two structures of Score
Generation Unit, Channel-wise Score Unit and Part-wise Score Unit, to assess
the quality of feature maps from different perspectives. Our network aggregates
features and scores in an end-to-end framework, so that final shape descriptors
are directly obtained from its output. Our experiments on ModelNet and ShapeNet
Core55 show that View Discerning Network outperforms the state-of-the-arts in
terms of the retrieval task, with excellent robustness against background
clutter and object occlusion.

been tremendous. This progress has been brought about by improvements in
methods for evaluating interatomic forces that work by either solving the
electronic structure problem explicitly, or by computing accurate
approximations of the solution and by the development of techniques that use
the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) forces to move the atoms on the BO potential energy
surface. As a consequence of these developments it is now possible to identify
stable or metastable states, to sample configurations consistent with the
appropriate thermodynamic ensemble, and to estimate the kinetics of reactions
and phase transitions. All too often, however, progress is slowed down by the
bottleneck associated with implementing new optimization algorithms and/or
sampling techniques into the many existing electronic-structure and
empirical-potential codes. To address this problem, we are thus releasing a new
version of the i-PI software. This piece of software is an easily extensible
framework for implementing advanced atomistic simulation techniques using
interatomic potentials and forces calculated by an external driver code. While
the original version of the code was developed with a focus on path integral
molecular dynamics techniques, this second release of i-PI not only includes
several new advanced path integral methods, but also offers other classes of
algorithms. In other words, i-PI is moving towards becoming a universal force
engine that is both modular and tightly coupled to the driver codes that
evaluate the potential energy surface and its derivatives.

The superconductivity in the tetragonal SrSnP is observed with the critical
temperature of ~2.3 K. The results of a crystallographic analysis,
superconducting characterization, and theoretical assessment of tetragonal
SrSnP are presented. The SrSnP crystallizes in the CaGaN structure type with
space group P4/nmm (S.G.129, Pearson symbol tP6) according to the single
crystal X-ray diffraction characterization. A combination of magnetic
susceptibility, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements confirms the bulk
superconductivity with Tc = 2.3(1) K in SrSnP. According to the X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement, the assignments of Sr2+ and P3-
are consistent with the chemical valence electron balance principles. Moreover,
it is highly likely that Sn atom has only one unusual oxidation state.
First-principles calculations indicate the bands around Fermi level are
hybridized among Sr-d, Sn-p, and P-p orbitals. The strong Sn-P and Sr-P
interactions pose as keys to stabilize the crystallographic structure and
induce the superconductivity, respectively. The physics-based electronic and
phononic calculations are consistent with the molecular viewpoint. After
including the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) into the calculation, the band
degeneracies at gamma-point in the first Brillouin zone (BZ) split into two
bands, which yield to the van Hove singularities around Fermi level.

data that exhibit spatial or spatio-temporal dependence. Specifically we
propose to consider stochastic processes obtained trough a monotone
transformation of scaled version of $\chi^2$ random processes. The latter are
well known in the specialized literature and originates by summing independent
copies of a squared Gaussian process. However their use as stochastic models
and related inference have not been much considered.
  Motivated by a spatio-temporal analysis of wind speed data from a network of
meteorological stations in the Netherlands, we exemplify our modeling strategy
by means of a non-stationary process with Weibull marginal distributions. For
the proposed Weibull process we study the second-order and geometrical
properties and we provide analytic expressions for the bivariate distribution.
Since the likelihood is intractable, even for relatively small data-set, we
suggest to adopt the pairwise likelihood as a tool for the inference. Moreover
we tackle the prediction problem and we propose a linear prediction. The
effectiveness of our modeling strategy is illustrated through the analysis of
the aforementioned Netherland wind speed data that we supplement with a
simulation study.

resilient to such perturbations. Despite the tremendous progress in recent
years, most multimodal convolutional neural network approaches directly
concatenate feature maps from individual modality streams rendering the model
incapable of focusing only on relevant complementary information for fusion. To
address this limitation, we propose a mutimodal semantic segmentation framework
that dynamically adapts the fusion of modality-specific features while being
sensitive to the object category, spatial location and scene context in a
self-supervised manner. Specifically, we propose an architecture consisting of
two modality-specific encoder streams that fuse intermediate encoder
representations into a single decoder using our proposed self-supervised model
adaptation fusion mechanism which optimally combines complementary features. As
intermediate representations are not aligned across modalities, we introduce an
attention scheme for better correlation. In addition, we propose a
computationally efficient unimodal segmentation architecture termed AdapNet++
that incorporates a new encoder with multiscale residual units and an efficient
atrous spatial pyramid pooling that has a larger effective receptive field with
more than 10x fewer parameters, complemented with a strong decoder with a
multi-resolution supervision scheme that recovers high-resolution details.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate that both

mathematicians are called to provide emotional labor in the discipline, thereby
illuminating a rarely visible component of a mathematical life in the academy.
Underlying this work is my contention that a conceptualization of labor
involved in managing emotions is of value to the project of understanding the
character, values, and boundaries of such a life. In order to investigate the
various dimensions of emotional labor in the context of academic mathematics, I
extend the basic framework of Morris and Feldman [33] and then apply this
extended framework to the mathematical sciences. Other researchers have mainly
focused on the negative effects of emotional labor on a laborer's physical,
emotional, and mental health, and several examples in this article align with
this framing. However, at the end of the article, I argue that mathematical
communities and mentoring structures such as EDGE help diminish some of the
negative aspects of emotional labor while also accentuating the positives.

sentence encoding models (Skipthought and FastSent) trained on a language
modeling task. We find that the BiLSTM trains much faster on fake sentence
detection (20 hours instead of weeks) using smaller amounts of data (1M instead
of 64M sentences). Further analysis shows the learned representations capture
many syntactic and semantic properties expected from good sentence
representations.

  Learning for Safe and Efficient Navigation in Complex Scenarios",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a decentralized sensor-level collision avoidance
policy for multi-robot systems, which shows promising results in practical
applications. In particular, our policy directly maps raw sensor measurements
to an agent's steering commands in terms of the movement velocity. As a first
step toward reducing the performance gap between decentralized and centralized
methods, we present a multi-scenario multi-stage training framework to learn an
optimal policy. The policy is trained over a large number of robots in rich,
complex environments simultaneously using a policy gradient based reinforcement
learning algorithm. The learning algorithm is also integrated into a hybrid
control framework to further improve the policy's robustness and effectiveness.
  We validate the learned sensor-level collision avoidance policy in a variety
of simulated and real-world scenarios with thorough performance evaluations for
large-scale multi-robot systems. The generalization of the learned policy is
verified in a set of unseen scenarios including the navigation of a group of
heterogeneous robots and a large-scale scenario with 100 robots. Although the
policy is trained using simulation data only, we have successfully deployed it
on physical robots with shapes and dynamics characteristics that are different
from the simulated agents, in order to demonstrate the controller's robustness
against the sim-to-real modeling error. Finally, we show that the
collision-avoidance policy learned from multi-robot navigation tasks provides
an excellent solution to the safe and effective autonomous navigation for a
single robot working in a dense real human crowd. Our learned policy enables a
robot to make effective progress in a crowd without getting stuck. Videos are

In this paper, we characterize mobility encounters and study the correlation
between encounters and web traffic profiles using large-scale datasets (30TB in
size) of WiFi and NetFlow traces. The analysis quantifies these correlations
for the first time, across spatio-temporal dimensions, for device types grouped
into on-the-go Flutes and sit-to-use Cellos. The results consistently show a
clear relation between mobility encounters and traffic across different
buildings over multiple days, with encountered pairs showing higher traffic
similarity than non-encountered pairs, and long encounters being associated
with the highest similarity. We also investigate the feasibility of learning
encounters through web traffic profiles, with implications for dissemination
protocols, and contact tracing. This provides a compelling case to integrate
both mobility and web traffic dimensions in future models, not only at an
individual level, but also at pairwise and collective levels. We have released

has shown great promises in the fields of collaborative filtering, data
compression, feature extraction, word embedding, etc. While many
problem-specific optimization techniques have been proposed, alternating least
square (ALS) remains popular due to its general applicability e.g. easy to
handle positive-unlabeled inputs, fast convergence and parallelization
capability. Current MF implementations are either optimized for a single
machine or with a need of a large computer cluster but still are insufficient.
This is because a single machine provides limited compute power for large-scale
data while multiple machines suffer from the network communication bottleneck.
  To address the aforementioned challenge, accelerating ALS on graphics
processing units (GPUs) is a promising direction. We propose the novel approach
in enhancing the MF efficiency via both memory optimization and approximate
computing. The former exploits GPU memory hierarchy to increase data reuse,
while the later reduces unnecessary computing without hurting the convergence
of learning algorithms. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets show that
our solution not only outperforms the competing CPU solutions by a large margin
but also has a 2x-4x performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art GPU
solutions. Our implementations are open-sourced and publicly available.

opportunity to design light-matter interactions at the nanoscale through
phenomena like resonant perfect absorption and extreme sub-wavelength light
concentration. To date, the utility of ENZ modes is limited in propagating
polaritonic systems by a relatively flat spectral dispersion, which gives ENZ
modes small group velocities and short propagation lengths. Here we overcome
this constraint by coupling ENZ modes to surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes
in doped cadmium oxide ENZ-on-SPP bilayers. What results is a strongly coupled
hybrid mode, characterized by strong anti-crossing and a large spectral
splitting on the order of 1/3 of the mode frequency. The resonant frequencies,
dispersion, and coupling of these polaritonic-hybrid-epsilon-near-zero (PH-ENZ)
modes are controlled by tailoring the modal oscillator strength and the ENZ-SPP
spectral overlap, which can potentially be utilized for actively tunable strong
coupling at the nanoscale. PH-ENZ modes ultimately leverage the most desirable

pre-disaster network retrofit projects in Phase I, a prioritization approach
for temporary repairs to facilitate immediate post-disaster emergency responses
in Phase II, and a methodology for scheduling network-wide repairs during the
long-term recovery of the roadway system in Phase III. Finally, this stage-wise
decision framework is applied to the roadway network of Shelby County, TN, USA

designed to strike a balance between expressivity and computational
tractability. Many different description logics have been developed, and
numerous computational problems for these logics have been studied for their
computational complexity. However, essentially all complexity analyses of
reasoning problems for description logics use the one-dimensional framework of
classical complexity theory. The multi-dimensional framework of parameterized
complexity theory is able to provide a much more detailed image of the
complexity of reasoning problems.
  In this paper we argue that the framework of parameterized complexity has a
lot to offer for the complexity analysis of description logic reasoning
problems---when one takes a progressive and forward-looking view on
parameterized complexity tools. We substantiate our argument by means of three
case studies. The first case study is about the problem of concept
satisfiability for the logic ALC with respect to nearly acyclic TBoxes. The
second case study concerns concept satisfiability for ALC concepts
parameterized by the number of occurrences of union operators and the number of
occurrences of full existential quantification. The third case study offers a
critical look at data complexity results from a parameterized complexity point
of view. These three case studies are representative for the wide range of uses
for parameterized complexity methods for description logic problems.

to establish the properties shared by them. In this way we point out their
common nature. Finally, we discuss and deeply analyze through the looking glass
of our unifying approach the relations between pairs of entropies. To this end
we formalize the notion of Bridge Theorem between two entropies $h_i:\mathfrak
X_i\to \mathbb R_+$, $i=1,2$, with respect to a functor $\varepsilon:\mathfrak
X_1\to\mathfrak X_2$. Then, for pairs of functorial entropies we use the above
scheme to introduce the notion and the related scheme of Strong Bridge Theorem,
which allows us to put under the same umbrella various relations between pairs
of entropies.

flow near a solid surface. This shear flow supports the turbulence
characteristic of fluid flow near boundaries at Reynolds numbers above
$\approx1000$ by making available to perturbations the kinetic energy of the
externally forced flow. Understanding the physical mechanism underlying this
energy transfer poses a fundamental question. Although qualitative
understanding that this transfer involves nonlinear destabilization of the
roll-streak coherent structure has been established, identification of this
instability has resisted analysis. The reason this instability has resisted
analysis is that its analytic expression lies in the Navier-Stokes equations
(NS) expressed using statistical rather than state variables. Expressing NS as
a statistical state dynamics (SSD) at second order in a cumulant expansion
suffices to allow analytical identification of the nonlinear roll-streak
instability underlying turbulence in wall-bounded shear flow. In this nonlinear
instability the turbulent perturbation field is identified by the SSD with the
Lyapunov vectors of the linear operator governing perturbation evolution about
the time-dependent streamwise mean flow. In this work, the implications of the
predictions of SSD analysis (that this parametric instability underlies the
dynamics of turbulence in Couette flow and that the perturbation structures are
the associated Lyapunov vectors) are interpreted to imply new conceptual
approaches to controlling turbulence. It is shown that the perturbation
component of turbulence is supported on the streamwise mean flow, which implies
optimal control should be formulated to suppress perturbations from the
streamwise mean. It is also shown that suppressing only the top few Lyapunov
vectors on the streamwise mean vectors results in laminarization. These results
are verified using DNS.

or other of these dimensions. For binocular disparity, on the other hand, the
terms 'horizontal' and 'vertical' disparities are commonly used. This is odd,
since binocular disparity and optic flow describe essentially the same thing.
The difference is that, generally, people tend to fixate relatively close to
the direction of heading as they move, meaning that fixation is close to the
optic flow epipole, whereas, for binocular vision, fixation is close to the
head-centric midline, i.e. approximately 90 degrees from the binocular epipole.
For fixating animals, some separations of flow may lead to simple algorithms
for the judgement of surface structure and the control of action. We consider
the following canonical flow patterns that sum to produce overall flow: (i)
'towards' flow, the component of translational flow produced by approaching (or
retreating from) the fixated object, which produces pure radial flow on the
retina; (ii) 'sideways' flow, the remaining component of translational flow,
which is produced by translation of the optic centre orthogonal to the
cyclopean line of sight and (iii) 'vergence' flow, rotational flow produced by
a counter-rotation of the eye in order to maintain fixation. A general flow
pattern could also include (iv) 'cyclovergence' flow, produced by rotation of
one eye relative to the other about the line of sight. We consider some
practical advantages of dividing up flow in this way when an observer fixates
as they move. As in some previous treatments, we suggest that there are certain
tasks for which it is sensible to consider 'towards' flow as one component and
'sideways' + 'vergence' flow as another.

sources from the DMC system's perspective. In this paper, the release of

the noise from the CPNS observed at the receiver is characterized. Considering

emission from the ejecta. We identify spectral variations in the nonthermal
emission, with hard emission being concentrated near the pulsar. We carry out
investigations of the Vela X ""cocoon"" structure and, with hydrodynamical
simulations, show that its overall properties are consistent with structures
formed in the late-phase evolution of a composite SNR expanding into a
surrounding medium with a density gradient, with ejecta material being swept
beyond the pulsar and compressed into an elongated structure in the direction
opposite the high external density.

  Lower Bounds for Non-smooth Convex Minimization",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC cs.DS cs.IT math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the limitations of parallelization in convex
optimization. A convenient approach to study parallelization is through the
prism of \emph{adaptivity} which is an information theoretic measure of the
parallel runtime of an algorithm [BS18]. Informally, adaptivity is the number
of sequential rounds an algorithm needs to make when it can execute
polynomially-many queries in parallel at every round. For combinatorial
optimization with black-box oracle access, the study of adaptivity has recently
led to exponential accelerations in parallel runtime and the natural question
is whether dramatic accelerations are achievable for convex optimization.
  For the problem of minimizing a non-smooth convex function $f:[0,1]^n\to
\mathbb{R}$ over the unit Euclidean ball, we give a tight lower bound that
shows that even when $\texttt{poly}(n)$ queries can be executed in parallel,
there is no randomized algorithm with $\tilde{o}(n^{1/3})$ rounds of adaptivity
that has convergence rate that is better than those achievable with a
one-query-per-round algorithm. A similar lower bound was obtained by Nemirovski
[Nem94], however that result holds for the $\ell_{\infty}$-setting instead of
$\ell_2$. In addition, we also show a tight lower bound that holds for
Lipschitz and strongly convex functions.
  At the time of writing this manuscript we were not aware of Nemirovski's
result. The construction we use is similar to the one in [Nem94], though our
analysis is different. Due to the close relationship between this work and
[Nem94], we view the research contribution of this manuscript limited and it
should serve as an instructful approach to understanding lower bounds for
parallel optimization.

probability distributions on its external firing patterns. We define two
operators on SNNs: a $composition$ $operator$, which supports modeling of SNNs
as combinations of smaller SNNs, and a $hiding$ $operator$, which reclassifies
some output behavior of an SNN as internal. We prove results showing how the
external behavior of a network built using these operators is related to the
external behavior of its component networks. Finally, we define the notion of a
$problem$ to be solved by an SNN, and show how the composition and hiding

skin lesion segmentation, where the network is optimized by the weighted
combination of a common supervised loss for labeled inputs only and a

a consistent prediction for unlabeled images using the outputs of the

we enhance the effect of regularization for pixel-level predictions by
introducing a transformation, including rotation and flipping, consistent

our method sets a new record on the benchmark of the International Skin Imaging

attributes of optimization techniques such as splitting of variables and
constant step size (learning rate). Furthermore, it provides a novel way of
exploiting the information about the affine constraints via fixed-point sets of
appropriate nonexpansive mappings. Among the offsprings of S-FM-HSDM, the
hierarchical recursive least squares (HRLS) takes advantage of S-FM-HSDM's
versatility toward affine constraints and offers a novel twist to LS by
generating sequences of estimates that converge to solutions of a hierarchical
optimization task: Minimize a convex loss over the set of minimizers of the

compares favorably to several state-of-the-art convex, as well as non-convex,

pertaining to EV charging and integration into the power system: (1) charging
station placement, (2) pricing policy and energy management strategy, and (3)
electricity trading market and distribution network design to facilitate
integrating EV and renewable energy source (RES) into the power system.
  For charging station placement problem, we propose a multi-stage consumer
behavior based placement strategy with incremental EV penetration rates and
model the EV charging industry as an oligopoly where the entire market is
dominated by a few charging service providers (oligopolists). The optimal
placement policy for each service provider is obtained by solving a Bayesian
game.
  For pricing and energy management of EV charging stations, we provide
guidelines for charging service providers to determine charging price and
manage electricity reserve to balance the competing objectives of improving
profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on the
power system. Two algorithms --- stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm
and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm) are applied to derive the pricing
and electricity procurement strategy.
  We design a novel electricity trading market and distribution network, which
supports seamless RES integration, grid to vehicle (G2V), vehicle to grid
(V2G), vehicle to vehicle (V2V), and distributed generation (DG) and storage.
We apply a sharing economy model to the electricity sector to stimulate
different entities to exchange and monetize their underutilized electricity. A
fitness-score (FS)-based supply-demand matching algorithm is developed by
considering consumer surplus, electricity network congestion, and economic

the classical ICP algorithm, to pairwise 3D point cloud registration with two
improvements of hybrid metric spaces (eg, BSC feature and Euclidean geometry
spaces) and globally optimal correspondences matching. First, we detect the
keypoints of point clouds and use the Binary Shape Context (BSC) descriptor to
encode their local features. Then, we formulate the correspondence matching
task as an energy function, which models the global similarity of keypoints on
the hybrid spaces of BSC feature and Euclidean geometry. Next, we estimate the
globally optimal correspondences through optimizing the energy function by the
Kuhn-Munkres algorithm and then calculate the transformation based on the
correspondences. Finally,we iteratively refine the transformation between two
point clouds by conducting optimal correspondences matching and transformation
calculation in a mutually reinforcing manner, to achieve the coarse-to-fine
registration under an unified framework.The proposed method is evaluated and
compared to several state-of-the-art methods on selected challenging datasets
with repetitive, symmetric and incomplete structures.Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed IGSP algorithm obtains good performance and
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both rotation and
translation errors.

Grand Master (VGM) concept that moves the synchronization point from separated
Backbone Border Routers (BBRs) towards the backbone network. With time

To this end, many
recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as
the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). Using matrix Factorization (MF) ---
the most widely used model in recommendation --- as a demonstration, we show
that optimizing it with BPR leads to a recommender model that is not robust. In
particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly
large error in generalization.
  To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its
generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely
Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise
ranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as
playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function
meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model
parameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works,
we implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding
vectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR --- by optimizing MF with APR, it
outperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves
state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation. Our implementation is

framed braids joined together at both ends by a connecting node (disk). These
surfaces with boundary are called braided 3-belts (or simply belts). Twisting
and braiding of ribbons composing braided 3-belts are interchangeable, and it
was shown in the literature that any braided 3-belt can be written in a pure
twist form, specified by a vector of three multiples of half integers [a,b,c],
a topological invariant.
  This paper identifies the set of braided 3-belts that can be written in a
braid only form in which all twisting is eliminated. For these braids an
algorithm to calculate the braid word is determined which allows the braid only
word of every braided 3-belt to be written in a canonical form. It is
furthermore demonstrated that the set of braided 3-belts do not form a group,
due to a lack of isogeny.
  The conditions under which the boundary of a braided 3-belt is a knot are
determined, and a formula for the Jones polynomial for knotted boundaries is
derived. Considering knotted boundaries makes it possible to relate the Helon
model to a model of quarks and leptons in terms of quantum trefoil knots,
understood as representation of the quantum group SUq(2). Associating
representations of a quantum group to the boundary of braided belts provides a
possible means of developing the gauge symmetries of interacting braided belts

Accepted in ApJ","The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 866, Number 1 (2018)","10.3847/1538-4357/aada0d",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One peculiar feature of the solar cycle which is yet to be understood
properly is the frequent occurrence of double peaks (also known as the
Gnevyshev peaks). Not only the double peaks but also multiple peaks and spikes
are often observed in any phase of the cycle. We propose that these peaks and
spikes are generated due to fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process (the
poloidal field generation from tilted bipolar magnetic regions). When the polar
field develops, large negative fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process can
reduce the net polar field abruptly. As these fluctuations in the polar field
are propagated to the new toroidal field, these can promote double peaks in the
next solar cycle. When fluctuations in the polar field occur outside the solar
maximum, we observe their effects as spikes or dips in the following sunspot
cycle. Using an axisymmetric Babcock-Leighton dynamo model we first demonstrate
this idea. Later, we perform a long simulation by including random scatter in
the poloidal field generation process and successfully reproduce the
double-peaked solar cycles. These results are robust under reasonable changes
in the model parameters as long as the diffusivity is not too larger than
$10^{12}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$. Finally, we analyze the observed polar field data to
show a close connection between the short-term fluctuations in the polar field
and the double peaks/spikes in the next cycle. Thereby, this supports our
theoretical idea that the fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process can be
responsible for the double peaks/spikes in the observed solar cycle.

encephalopathy (CTE), increased risks of neurodegenerative disease, and
associations between concussion history and later-life cognitive impairment and
depression among retired professional football players.
  A recent observational study of a cohort of men who graduated from a
Wisconsin high school in 1957 found no statistically significant harmful
effects of playing high school football on a range of cognitive, psychological,
and socio-economic outcomes measured at ages 35, 54, 65, and 72. Unfortunately,
these findings may not generalize to younger populations, thanks to changes and
improvements in football helmet technology and training techniques. In
particular, these changes may have led to increased perceptions of safety but
ultimately more dangerous styles of play, characterized by the frequent
sub-concussive impacts thought to be associated with later-life neurological
decline.

observational study using data from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). These include adolescent and family
co-morbidities, academic experience, self-reported levels of general health and
physical activity, and the score on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test. Our
primary outcome is the CES-D score measured in 2008 when subjects were aged 24

outcomes related to physical and psychological health, including suicidality.

introduced into the generator network. Furthermore, to alleviate the
oversmoothing shortcoming of the traditional mean squared error (MSE) loss
function, the perceptual similarity, which is implemented by calculating the
distances in the feature space extracted by a pretrained VGG-19 network, is
incorporated with the MSE and adversarial losses to form the new loss function.
Extensive experiments are implemented to assess the performance of the proposed
method. The experimental results show that the proposed RED-WGAN achieves
performance superior to several state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and
real clinical data. In particular, our method demonstrates powerful abilities
in both noise suppression and structure preservation.

with temperature, which manifests photospheric emissions from a different
radius and/or angle. The effects of the minimum temperature $kT_{\min }$, the
maximum temperature $kT_{\max }$ and the power law index $m$ of the luminosity
distribution of an mBB are discussed. The fitting to the time-integrated
spectrum during the bright phase (from 20s to 30s since the trigger) of GRB
081221 by the mBB model yields $kT_{\min }$ = $4.4\pm 0.3$ keV, $kT_{\max }$ =
57.0 $_{-1.4}^{+1.6}$ keV, and $m=-0.46_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$. When the time bin is
small enough, the time-resolved spectra of GRB 081221 are well fitted with a
series of single-temperature blackbodies. Our results imply the prompt emission
of GRB 081221 is dominated by the photosphere emission and its time-integrated
spectrum is a superposition of pure blackbody components at different times,
indicating that some empirical Band spectra may be interpreted as mBB if the
temperature is widely distributed.

obtained from depth-averaging the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes
equations across the channel height. Specifically, the Navier--Stokes equations
are scaled in the viscous lubrication limit relevant to microfluidics. The
resulting set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is solved
numerically through a segregated approach employing fully-implicit time
stepping. We explore both the static and dynamic FSI behavior of this example
microchannel system by varying a reduced Reynolds number $Re$, which
necessarily changes the Strouhal number $St$, while we keep the geometry and a
modified dimensionless Young's modulus $\Sigma$ fixed. At steady state, an
order-of-magnitude analysis (balancing argument) shows that the
axially-averaged pressure in the flow, $\langle P\rangle$, exhibits two
different scaling regimes, while the maximum deformation of the top wall of the
channel, $H_{\mathrm{max}}$, can fall into four different regimes, depending on
the magnitudes of $Re$ and $\Sigma$. These regimes are physically explained as
resulting from the competition between the inertial and viscous forces in the
fluid flow as well as the bending resistance and tension in the elastic wall.
Finally, the linear stability of the steady inflated microchannel shape is
assessed via a modal analysis, showing the existence of many highly oscillatory
but stable modes, which further highlights the computational challenge of
simulating unsteady FSIs.

This suggests a remarkable generalization ability of the net, making it

natural images, researchers have begun to apply them to neuroimaging data. To
date, however, exploration of novel CNN architectures tailored to neuroimaging
data has been limited. Several recent works fail to leverage the 3D structure
of the brain, instead treating the brain as a set of independent 2D slices.
Approaches that do utilize 3D convolutions rely on architectures developed for
object recognition tasks in natural 2D images. Such architectures make
assumptions about the input that may not hold for neuroimaging. For example,
existing architectures assume that patterns in the brain exhibit translation
invariance. However, a pattern in the brain may have different meaning
depending on where in the brain it is located. There is a need to explore novel
architectures that are tailored to brain images. We present two simple
modifications to existing CNN architectures based on brain image structure.
Applied to the task of brain age prediction, our network achieves a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 1.4 years and trains 30% faster than a CNN baseline
that achieves a MAE of 1.6 years. Our results suggest that lessons learned from
developing models on natural images may not directly transfer to neuroimaging
tasks. Instead, there remains a large space of unexplored questions regarding
model development in this area, whose answers may differ from conventional
wisdom.

both images and videos. Given a novel image or video, our approach produces a
pixel-level mask for all ""object-like"" regions---even for object categories
never seen during training. We formulate the task as a structured prediction
problem of assigning an object/background label to each pixel, implemented
using a deep fully convolutional network. When applied to a video, our model
further incorporates a motion stream, and the network learns to combine both
appearance and motion and attempts to extract all prominent objects whether
they are moving or not. Beyond the core model, a second contribution of our
approach is how it leverages varying strengths of training annotations.
Pixel-level annotations are quite difficult to obtain, yet crucial for training
a deep network approach for segmentation. Thus we propose ways to exploit
weakly labeled data for learning dense foreground segmentation. For images, we
show the value in mixing object category examples with image-level labels
together with relatively few images with boundary-level annotations. For video,
we show how to bootstrap weakly annotated videos together with the network
trained for image segmentation. Through experiments on multiple challenging
image and video segmentation benchmarks, our method offers consistently strong
results and improves the state-of-the-art for fully automatic segmentation of
generic (unseen) objects. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach benefits
image retrieval and image retargeting, both of which flourish when given our
high-quality foreground maps. Code, models, and videos are

has established the properties of the rich power spectrum of the detected
radiation and, derived thereof, the physical properties of this celestial body.
Those of the measurements which are available online are analysed in this work
from a different perspective. After the measurements were band-passed, they
were split into two parts (of comparable sizes), one yielding the training
(learning) set (i.e., the database of embedding vectors and associated
predictions), the other the test set. The optimal embedding dimension $m_0=10$
was obtained using Cao's method; this result was confirmed by an analysis of
the correlation dimension. Subsequently, the extraction of the maximal Lyapunov
exponent $\lambda$ was pursued for embedding dimensions $m$ between $3$ and
$12$; results were obtained after removing the prominent undulations of the
out-of-sample prediction-error arrays $S (k)$ by fitting a monotonic function
to the data. The grand mean of the values, obtained for sufficient embedding
dimensions ($10 \leq m \leq 12$), was: $\lambda = (9.2 \pm 1.0 ({\rm stat.})
\pm 2.7 ({\rm syst.})) \cdot 10^{-2}~\Delta \tau^{-1}$, where $\Delta \tau=10$
s is the sampling interval in the measurements. On the basis of this
significantly non-zero result, it may be concluded that the physical processes,
underlying the variation of the luminosity of PG 1159-035, are non-linear. The
aforementioned result for $\lambda$ was obtained using the $L^\infty$-norm
distance; a larger, yet not incompatible, result was extracted with the
Euclidean ($L^2$-norm) distance.

intelligence and human communication analysis. It is a significant technical
challenge since humans display their emotions through complex idiosyncratic
combinations of the language, visual and acoustic modalities. In contrast to
traditional multimodal fusion techniques, we approach emotion recognition from
both direct person-independent and relative person-dependent perspectives. The
direct person-independent perspective follows the conventional emotion
recognition approach which directly infers absolute emotion labels from
observed multimodal features. The relative person-dependent perspective
approaches emotion recognition in a relative manner by comparing partial video
segments to determine if there was an increase or decrease in emotional
intensity. Our proposed model integrates these direct and relative prediction
perspectives by dividing the emotion recognition task into three easier
subtasks. The first subtask involves a multimodal local ranking of relative
emotion intensities between two short segments of a video. The second subtask
uses local rankings to infer global relative emotion ranks with a Bayesian
ranking algorithm. The third subtask incorporates both direct predictions from
observed multimodal behaviors and relative emotion ranks from local-global
rankings for final emotion prediction. Our approach displays excellent
performance on an audio-visual emotion recognition benchmark and improves over
other algorithms for multimodal fusion.

results in the formation of weak planes along the extrusion process. It has
been observed that large longitudinal cracks often form in these shafts before
any circumferential cracks when these shafts are subjected to cyclic torsion
due to electrical line faults. The presence of these cracks could severely
compromise the shaft resonance frequencies. Dynamic response of shafts with
longitudinal and circumferential cracks is investigated. The longitudinal
cracked section of the shaft section is modeled as a shaft with reduced
torsional rigidity. The torsional rigidity is obtained as a function of the
crack depth. It was found for various shaft diameters, torsional rigidity could
be represented as a function of crack depth/ shaft radius only. The
circumferential cracked section is modeled as a torsional spring. The torsional
spring constant has been obtained using fracture mechanics. It was found the
resonance frequency of the shaft may be little affected by the presence of
longitudinal crack. The resonance frequencies of the shaft with the
circumferential crack depend on the crack length and location. The effects of
crack surface interactions for both longitudinal and circumferential cracks
were also investigated.
