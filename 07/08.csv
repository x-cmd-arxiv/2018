approaches for realizing nano-scale communications in biological environments
for healthcare applications. In this paper, a DMC system in biological
cylindrical environment is considered, inspired by blood vessel structures in
the body. The internal surface of the cylinder boundary is assumed to be
covered by the biological receptors which may irreversibly react with hitting
molecules. Also, information molecules diffusing in the fluid medium are
subject to a degradation reaction and flow. The concentration Green's function
of diffusion in this environment is analytically derived which takes into
account asymmetry in all radial, axial and azimuthal coordinates. Employing
obtained Green's function, information channel between transmitter and
transparent receiver of DMC is characterized. To evaluate the DMC system in the
biological cylinder, a simple on-off keying modulation scheme is adopted and
corresponding error probability is derived. Particle based simulation results
confirm the proposed analysis. Also, the effect of different system parameters
on the concentration Green's function are examined. Our results reveal that the
degradation reaction and the boundary covered by biological receptors may be
utilized to mitigate intersymbol interference and outperform corresponding
error probability.

decision is given based on a predefined threshold over a single value. On the
other hand, some machine learning based algorithms are also reported in the

pitfalls; thus our motivation was to coalesce them to get the best out of the
both worlds. Hence we have developed, VFPred that, in addition to employing a
signal processing pipeline, namely, Empirical Mode Decomposition and Discrete

for an efficient and scalable maintenance strategy decision plan. Traditional
spare strategies for satellite constellations cannot handle these
mega-constellations due to their limited scalability in number of satellites
and/or frequency of failures. In this paper, we propose a novel spare strategy
using an inventory management approach. We consider a set of parking orbits at
a lower altitude than the constellation for spare storage, and model satellite
constellation spare strategy problem using a multi-echelon (s,Q)-type inventory
policy, viewing Earth's ground as a supplier, parking orbits as warehouses, and
in-plane spare stocks as retailers. This inventory model is unique in that the
parking orbits (warehouses) drift away from the orbital planes over time due to
orbital mechanics' effects, and the in-plane spare stocks (retailers) would
receive the resupply from the closest (i.e., minimum waiting time) available
warehouse at the time of delivery. The parking orbits (warehouses) are also
resupplied from the ground (supplier) with stochastic lead time caused by the
order processing and launch opportunities, leveraging the cost saving effects
by launching many satellites in one rocket (i.e., batch launch discount). The
proposed analytical model is validated against simulations using Latin
Hypercube Sampling. Furthermore, based on the proposed model, an optimization
formulation is introduced to identify the optimal spare strategy, comprising
the parking orbits characteristics and all locations policies, to minimize the
maintenance cost of the system given performance requirements. The proposed
model and optimization method are applied to a real-world case study of
satellite mega-constellation to demonstrate their value.

the realization of numerous quantum phases are discussed within the mean field

conduction capabilities of nanocolloidal dispersions. A thoroughly designed
experimental system has been envisaged to solely probe heat conduction across
nanofluids by specifically eliminating the buoyancy driven convective
component. Electric field is applied across the test specimen in order to
induce electrophoresis in conjunction with the existing thermal gradient. It is
observed that the electrophoretic drift of the nanoparticles acts as an
additional thermal transport drift mechanism over and above the already
existent Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis dominated thermal conduction. A
scaling analysis of the thermophoretic and electrophoretic velocities from
classical Huckel-Smoluchowski formalism is able to mathematically predict the
thermal performance enhancement due to electrophoresis. It is also inferred
that the dielectric characteristics of the particle material is the major
determining component of the electrophoretic amplification of heat transfer.
Influence of surfactants has also been probed into and it is observed that
enhancing the stability via surface charge modulation can in fact enhance the
electrophoretic drift, thereby enhancing heat transfer calibre. Also,
surfactants ensure colloidal stability as well as chemical gradient induced
recirculation, thus ensuring colloidal phase equilibrium and low hysteresis in
spite of the directional drift in presence of electric field forcing. The
findings may have potential implications in enhanced and tunable thermal
management of micro nanoscale devices.

why in this environment, TCP and its flavors, which are generally designed for
wired networks, perform poorly.
  To cope with these challenges, we present C2TCP, a flexible end-to-end
solution targeting interactive applications requiring high throughput and low
delay in cellular networks. C2TCP stands on top of loss-based TCP and brings it
delay sensitivity without requiring any network state profiling, channel
prediction, or complicated rate adjustment mechanisms. The key idea behind
C2TCP is to absorb dynamics of unpredictable cellular channels by investigating
local minimum delay of packets in a moving time window and react to the
cellular network's capacity changes very fast.
  Through extensive trace-based evaluations using traces from five commercial
LTE and 3G networks, we have compared performance of C2TCP with various TCP
variants, and state-of-the-art schemes including BBR, Verus, and Sprout.
Results show that on average, C2TCP outperforms these schemes and achieves

metrology. In this paper we study the problem of quantum Fisher information of
unitary processes. Associated to each parameter $\theta_i$ of unitary process
$U(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, there exists a unique Hermitian matrix
$M_{\theta_i}=i(U^\dagger\partial_{\theta_i} U)$. Except for some simple cases,
such as when the parameter under estimation is an overall multiplicative factor
in the Hamiltonian, calculation of these matrices is not an easy task to treat
even for estimating a single parameter of qubit systems. Using the Bloch vector
$\boldsymbol{m}_{\theta_i}$, corresponding to each matrix $M_{\theta_i}$, we
find a closed relation for the quantum Fisher information matrix of the $SU(2)$
processes for an arbitrary number of estimation parameters and an arbitrary
initial state. We extend our results and present an explicit relation for each
vector $\boldsymbol{m}_{\theta_i}$ for a general Hamiltonian with arbitrary
parametrization. We illustrate our results by obtaining the quantum Fisher
information matrix of the so-called angle-axis parameters of a general $SU(2)$
process. Using a linear transformation between two different parameter spaces
of a unitary process, we provide a way to move from quantum Fisher information
of a unitary process in a given parametrization to the one of the other
parametrization. Knowing this linear transformation enables one to calculate
the quantum Fisher information of a composite unitary process, i.e. a unitary
process resulted from successive action of some simple unitary processes. We
apply this method for a spin-half system and obtain the quantum Fisher matrix
of the coset parameters in terms of the one of the angle-axis parameters.

survey and the SDSS Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
spectroscopic follow-up of them, we compare the properties of X-ray unobscured
and obscured broad-line AGN (BLAGN1 and BLAGN2; $N_\textrm{H}$below and above
$10^{21.5}$ cm$^{-2}$), including their X-ray luminosity $L_X$, black hole
mass, Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\textrm{Edd}}$, optical continuum and line
features. We find that BLAGN2 have systematically larger broad line widths and
hence apparently higher (lower) $M_{\textrm{BH}}$ ($\lambda_{\textrm{Edd}}$)
than BLAGN1. We also find that the X-ray obscuration in BLAGN tends to coincide
with optical dust extinction, which is optically thinner than that in
narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) and likely partial-covering to the broad line region.
All the results can be explained in the framework of a multi-component, clumpy
torus model by interpreting BLAGN2 as an intermediate type between BLAGN1 and
NLAGN in terms of an intermediate inclination angle.

  Imagery","ACCV 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Automatic multi-class object detection in remote sensing images in
unconstrained scenarios is of high interest for several applications including
traffic monitoring and disaster management. The huge variation in object scale,
orientation, category, and complex backgrounds, as well as the different camera
sensors pose great challenges for current algorithms. In this work, we propose
a new method consisting of a novel joint image cascade and feature pyramid
network with multi-size convolution kernels to extract multi-scale strong and
weak semantic features. These features are fed into rotation-based region
proposal and region of interest networks to produce object detections. Finally,
rotational non-maximum suppression is applied to remove redundant detections.
During training, we minimize joint horizontal and oriented bounding box loss
functions, as well as a novel loss that enforces oriented boxes to be
rectangular. Our method achieves 68.16% mAP on horizontal and 72.45% mAP on
oriented bounding box detection tasks on the challenging DOTA dataset,
outperforming all published methods by a large margin (+6% and +12% absolute
improvement, respectively). Furthermore, it generalizes to two other datasets,
NWPU VHR-10 and UCAS-AOD, and achieves competitive results with the baselines
even when trained on DOTA. Our method can be deployed in multi-class object
detection applications, regardless of the image and object scales and
orientations, making it a great choice for unconstrained aerial and satellite
imagery.

of algorithms tailored to specific telescope arrays and science cases. We
present DeepSource - a deep learning solution - that uses convolutional neural
networks to achieve these goals. DeepSource enhances the Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) of the original map and then uses dynamic blob detection to detect
sources. Trained and tested on two sets of 500 simulated 1 deg x 1 deg MeerKAT
images with a total of 300,000 sources, DeepSource is essentially perfect in
both purity and completeness down to SNR = 4 and outperforms PyBDSF in all
metrics. For uniformly-weighted images it achieves a Purity x Completeness (PC)
score at SNR = 3 of 0.73, compared to 0.31 for the best PyBDSF model. For
natural-weighting we find a smaller improvement of ~40% in the PC score at SNR

90%, we find that DeepSource reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the
4.3 of PyBDSF (natural-weighting). A key advantage of DeepSource is that it can
learn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under
consideration. Our results show that deep learning is a promising approach to
point source detection in astronomical images.

is extremely sensitive to electrode potential and current density. It is also
remarkably sensitive to the conductivity ratio of electrons and holes, as well

electrically loaded zirconia. More broadly speaking, the oxygen potential
transition is akin to a first-order phase transition. Therefore, it will suffer
interface instability, especially in high-current-density devices. These

maintaining strong privacy for vehicles prior to revocation events, even with

addresses all these challenges and thus closes a gap in the literature. Our
scheme radically reduces CRL distribution overhead: each vehicle receives CRLs
corresponding only to its region of operation and its actual trip duration.
Moreover, a ""fingerprint"" of CRL 'pieces' is attached to a subset of
(verifiable) pseudonyms for fast CRL 'piece' validation (while mitigating
resource depletion attacks abusing the CRL distribution). Our experimental
evaluation shows that our scheme is efficient, scalable, dependable, and
practical: with no more than 25 KB/s of traffic load, the latest CRL can be
delivered to 95% of the vehicles in a region (50x50 KM) within 15s, i.e., more

lattice has been the subject of a long controversy due to the simultaneous
$Z_2$ and $O(2)$ symmetry existing in the model. The $O(2)$ symmetry being
responsible for the Berezinskii - Kosterlitz - Thouless transition ($BKT$)
while the $Z_2$ drives an Ising-like transition. There are arguments supporting
two possible scenarios, one advocating that the loss of $Ising$ and $BKT$ order
take place at the same temperature $T_{t}$ and the other that the $Z_2$
transition occurs at a higher temperature than the $BKT$ one. In the first case
an immediate consequence is that this model is in a new universality class.
Most of the studies take hand of some order parameter like the stiffness,
Binder's cumulant or magnetization to obtain the transition temperature.
Considering that the transition temperatures are obtained, in general, as an
average over the estimates taken about several of those quantities, it is
difficult to decide if they are describing the same or slightly separate
transitions. In this paper we describe an iterative method based on the
knowledge of the complex zeros of the energy probability distribution to study
the critical behavior of the system. The method is general with advantages over
most conventional techniques since it does not need to identify any order
parameter \emph{a priori}. The critical temperature and exponents can be
obtained with good precision. We apply the method to study the Fully Frustrated
Planar Rotator ($PR$) and the Anisotropic Heisenberg ($XY$) models in two
dimensions. We show that both models are in a new universality class with
$T_{PR}=0.45286(32)$ and $T_{XY}=0.36916(16)$ and the transition exponent
$\nu=0.824(30)$ ($\frac{1}{\nu}=1.22(4)$).

of an existing optimization-based PCA (O-PCA) method. Both CNN-PCA and O-PCA
entail post-processing a PCA model to better honor complex geological features.
In CNN-PCA, rather than use a histogram-based regularization as in O-PCA, a new
regularization involving a set of metrics for multipoint statistics is
introduced. The metrics are based on summary statistics of the nonlinear filter
responses of geological models to a pre-trained deep CNN. In addition, in the
CNN-PCA formulation presented here, a convolutional neural network is trained
as an explicit transform function that can post-process PCA models quickly.
CNN-PCA is shown to provide both unconditional and conditional realizations
that honor the geological features present in reference SGeMS geostatistical
realizations for a binary channelized system. Flow statistics obtained through
simulation of random CNN-PCA models closely match results for random SGeMS
models for a demanding case in which O-PCA models lead to significant
discrepancies. Results for history matching are also presented. In this
assessment CNN-PCA is applied with derivative-free optimization, and a subspace
randomized maximum likelihood method is used to provide multiple posterior
models. Data assimilation and significant uncertainty reduction are achieved
for existing wells, and physically reasonable predictions are also obtained for
new wells. Finally, the CNN-PCA method is extended to a more complex
non-stationary bimodal deltaic fan system, and is shown to provide high-quality
realizations for this challenging example.

time dependent wave equation in two and three-dimensional spatial domains.
Relying on Fourier Transformation in time, the method utilizes a fixed
(time-independent) number of frequency-domain integral-equation solutions to
evaluate, with superalgebraically-small errors, time domain solutions for
arbitrarily long times. The approach relies on two main elements, namely, 1) A
smooth time-windowing methodology that enables accurate band-limited
representations for arbitrarily-long time signals, and 2) A novel Fourier
transform approach which, in a time-parallel manner and without causing
spurious periodicity effects, delivers numerically dispersionless
spectrally-accurate solutions. A similar hybrid technique can be obtained on
the basis of Laplace transforms instead of Fourier transforms, but we do not
consider the Laplace-based method in the present contribution. The algorithm
can handle dispersive media, it can tackle complex physical structures, it
enables parallelization in time in a straightforward manner, and it allows for
time leaping---that is, solution sampling at any given time $T$ at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$-bounded sampling cost, for arbitrarily large values of $T$,
and without requirement of evaluation of the solution at intermediate times.
The proposed frequency-time hybridization strategy, which generalizes to any
linear partial differential equation in the time domain for which
frequency-domain solutions can be obtained (including e.g. the time-domain
Maxwell equations), and which is applicable in a wide range of scientific and
engineering contexts, provides significant advantages over other available
alternatives such as volumetric discretization, time-domain integral equations,
and convolution-quadrature approaches.

evaporation dynamics in pendent droplets in an electric field ambience. The
evaporation kinetics of pendant droplets of electrically conducting saline
solutions in the presence of a transverse, alternating electric field is
investigated experimentally. It has been observed that while increase of field
strength arrests the evaporation, increment in field frequency has the opposite
effect. The same has been explained on the solvation kinetics of the ions in
the polar water. Theoretical analysis reveals that change in surface tension
and diffusion driven evaporation model cannot predict the arrested or
decelerated evaporation. With the aid of Particle Image Velocimetry,
suppression of internal circulation velocity within the droplet is observed
under electric field stimulus, and this affects the evaporation rate directly.
A mathematical scaling model is proposed to quantify the effects of
electrohydrodynamic circulation, electrothermal and electro-solutal advection
on the evaporation kinetics of the droplet. The analysis encompasses major
governing parameters, viz. the thermal and solutal Marangoni numbers, the
Electrohydrodynamic number, the electro Prandtl and electro Schmidt numbers and
their respective contributions. It has been shown that the electrothermal
Marangoni effect is supressed by the electric field, leading to deteriorated
evaporation rates. Additionally, the electrosolutal Marangoni effect further
supresses the internal advection, which again arrests the evaporation rate by a
larger proportion. Stability analysis reveals that the electric body force
retards the stable internal circulation within such droplets and arrests
advection.

fundamental challenge for mobile mmWave communication systems. The sudden
blockage of the line-of-sight (LOS) link between the base station and the
mobile user normally leads to disconnecting the communication session, which
highly impacts the system reliability. Further, reconnecting the user to
another LOS base station incurs high beam training overhead and critical
latency problems. In this paper, we leverage machine learning tools and propose
a novel solution for these reliability and latency challenges in mmWave MIMO
systems. In the developed solution, the base stations learn how to predict that
a certain link will experience blockage in the next few time frames using their
past observations of adopted beamforming vectors. This allows the serving base
station to proactively hand-over the user to another base station with a highly
probable LOS link. Simulation results show that the developed deep learning
based strategy successfully predicts blockage/hand-off in close to 95% of the
times. This reduces the probability of communication session disconnection,
which ensures high reliability and low latency in mobile mmWave systems.

within Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), this work addresses the problem of
abnormality detection in a blood vessel using multiple biological embedded
computing devices called cooperative biological nanomachines (CNs), and a
common receiver called the fusion center (FC). Due to blood flow inside a
vessel, each CN and the FC are assumed to be mobile. In this work, each of the
CNs perform abnormality detection with certain probabilities of detection and
false alarm by counting the number of molecules received from a source, e.g.,
infected tissue. These CNs subsequently report their local decisions to a FC
over a diffusion-advection blood flow channel using different types of
molecules in the presence of inter-symbol interference, multi-source
interference, and counting errors. Due to limited computational capability at
the FC, OR and AND logic based fusion rules are employed to make the final
decision after obtaining each local decision based on the optimal likelihood
ratio test. For the aforementioned system, probabilities of detection and false
alarm at the FC are derived for OR and AND fusion rules. Finally, simulation
results are presented to validate the derived analytical results, which provide
important insights.

collection of open convex sets in some Euclidean space. Convex codes are
relevant to neuroscience as they arise from the activity of neurons that have
convex receptive fields. In this paper, we use algebraic methods to determine
if a code is convex. Specifically, we use the neural ideal of a code, which is
a generalization of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. Using the neural ideal together
with its standard generating set, the canonical form, we provide algebraic
signatures of certain families of codes that are non-convex. We connect these
signatures to the precise conditions on the arrangement of sets that prevent
the codes from being convex. Finally, we also provide algebraic signatures for
some families of codes that are convex, including the class of
intersection-complete codes. These results allow us to detect convexity and
non-convexity in a variety of situations, and point to some interesting open

fail to produce that kind of representation. Word embedding, distributed
representation of words, has shown an excellent performance that allows words
to match on semantic level. Naively concatenating word embeddings makes the
common word dominant which in turn diminish the representation quality. In this

commonly used verbal working memory tasks that have partially overlapping uses
in clinical and experimental psychology. We performed three activation
likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, comparing two load levels of the
n-back task (2-back, 3-back) to the PASAT and to each-other. These analyses
aimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for
these tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the
frontal eye fields in the 3-back. The PASAT exhibited higher overall activation
in the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), left supramarginal gyrus, and
left superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher
activation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the
2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right
premotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).
These data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with
the phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.
Furthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional
processing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the
well-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,
premotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks. Conclusions: Here we
identify regions activated by the PASAT, which has not been meta-analytically
reviewed prior to this study. Using ALE meta-analysis, we have also identified
meaningful differences in activation associated with specific cognitive and

This transition is believed to occur across a locus of thermodynamic states
called the Frenkel line. The Frenkel line has been extensively investigated
from the viewpoint of the dynamics, but its structural meaning is not still
well understood. This letter interprets the mesoscopic picture of the Frenkel
line entirely based on a topological and geometrical framework. This discovery
makes it possible to understand the mechanism of rigid/non-rigid transition
based not on the dynamics of individual atoms, but on their instantaneous
configurations. The topological classification method reveals that the
percolation of solid-like structures occurs above the rigid-nonrigid crossover
densities.

that Einstein-Bell locality inequalities can be violated by the two mode

a positive Wigner function. I use here the more general Gleason-Kochen-Specker

derive non-contextuality Bell inequalities for correlations of $N$ pseudo spins
embedded in an infinite dimensional continuous variable Hilbert space, and show
that their maximum possible quantum violation is by a factor $2^{(N-1)/2}$. I
find quantum states for which this maximum violation is reached. I also show
that the familiar displaced squeezed vacuum for a single optical mode, which
has a positive Wigner function, can violate the inequality by a factor $0.842
(\sqrt{2})^{N-1} $ for odd $N \geq 3$ . The arbitrarily large non-classicality
means that realizations of the pseudo-spin measurements even in a single mode

remote observer and a detector, is studied. The remote observer has access to a
discrete memoryless source, and communicates its observations to the detector
via a rate-limited noiseless channel. The detector observes another discrete
memoryless source, and performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint
distribution of its own observations with those of the observer. While the goal
of the observer is to maximize the type II error exponent of the test for a
given type I error probability constraint, it also wants to keep a private part
of its observations as oblivious to the detector as possible. Considering both
equivocation and average distortion under a causal disclosure assumption as
possible measures of privacy, the trade-off between the communication rate from
the observer to the detector, the type II error exponent, and privacy is
studied. For the general HT problem, we establish single-letter inner bounds on
both the rate-error exponent-equivocation and rate-error exponent-distortion
trade-offs. Subsequently, single-letter characterizations for both trade-offs
are obtained (i) for testing against conditional independence of the observer's
observations from those of the detector, given some additional side-information
at the detector; and (ii) when the communication rate constraint over the
channel is zero. Finally, we show by providing a counterexample that, the
strong converse which holds for distributed HT without a privacy constraint,
does not hold when a privacy constraint is imposed. This implies that, in
general, the rate-error exponent-equivocation and rate-error
exponent-distortion trade-offs are not independent of the type I error

During this time, ribosomes, RNA polymerases, and the proteome are all doubled.
Yet, the question of how to relate bacterial doubling time to other
biologically relevant time scales in the growth process remains illusive, due
to the complex temporal nesting pattern of these processes. In particular, the
relation between the cell's doubling time and the ribosome assembly time is not
known. Here we develop a model that connects growth rate to ribosome assembly
time and show that the existence of a self-assembly step increases the overall
growth rate, because during ribosome self-assembly existing ribosomes can start
a new round of reproduction, by making a new batch of ribosomal proteins prior
to the completion of the previous round. This overlapping of ribosome
reproduction cycles increases growth rate beyond the serial-limit that is
typically assumed to hold. Using recent data from ribosome profiling and well
known measurements of the average translation rate, rigid bounds on the in-vivo
ribosome self-assembly time are set, which are robust to the assumptions
regarding the biological noises involved. At 21 minutes doubling time, the
ribosome assembly time is found to be approximately 6 minutes --- three fold
larger than the common estimate. We further use our model to explain the
detrimental effect of a recently discovered ribosome assembly inhibitor drug,
and predict the effect of limiting the expression of ribosome assembly
chaperons on the overall growth rate.

displacement functions of automorphisms of free groups (more generally, free
products) on Culler-Vogtmann Outer space and its simplicial bordification - the
free splitting complex - with respect to the Lipschitz metric. The theory for
irreducible automorphisms being well-developed, we concentrate on the reducible
case. Since we deal with the bordification, we develop all the needed tools in
the more general setting of deformation spaces, and their associated free
splitting complexes.
  In the present paper we study the local properties of the displacement
function. In particular, we study its convexity properties and the behaviour at
bordification points, by geometrically characterising its continuity-points. We
prove that the global-simplex-displacement spectrum of $Aut(F_n)$ is a
well-ordered subset of $\mathbb R$, this being helpful for algorithmic
purposes. We introduce a weaker notion of train tracks, which we call {\em
partial train tracks} (which coincides with the usual one for irreducible
automorphisms) and we prove that, for any automorphism, points of minimal
displacement - minpoints - coincide with the marked metric graphs that support
partial train tracks. We show that any automorphism, reducible or not, has a
partial train track (hence a minpoint) either in the outer space or its
bordification. We show that, given an automorphism, any of its invariant free
factors is seen in a partial train track map. In a subsequent paper we will

displacement functions of automorphisms of free groups (more generally, free
products) on the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space $CV_n$ and its simplicial
bordification. We develop a theory for both reducible and irreducible
autormorphisms. As we reach the bordification of $CV_n$ we have to deal with
general deformation spaces, for this reason we developed the theory in such
generality. In first paper~\cite{FMpartI} we studied general properties of the
displacement functions, such as well-orderability of the spectrum and the
topological characterization of min-points via partial train tracks (possibly
at infinity). This paper is devoted to proving that for any automorphism
(reducible or not) any level set of the displacement function is connected. As
an application, this result provides a stopping procedure for brute force
search algorithms in $CV_n$. We use this to reprove two known algorithmic
results: the conjugacy problem for irreducible automorphisms and detecting
irreducibility of automorphisms. Note: the two papers were originally packed
together in the preprint arxiv:1703.09945. We decided to split that paper

to interact while maintaining benefits of both styles. The key to reasoning
about these mixed programs is Siek-Vitousek-Cimini-Boyland's (dynamic) gradual
guarantee, which says that giving components of a program more precise types
only adds runtime type checking, and does not otherwise change behavior. In
this paper, we give a semantic reformulation of the gradual guarantee called
graduality. We change the name to promote the analogy that graduality is to
gradual typing what parametricity is to polymorphism. Each gives a
local-to-global, syntactic-to-semantic reasoning principle that is formulated
in terms of a kind of observational approximation.
  Utilizing the analogy, we develop a novel logical relation for proving
graduality. We show that embedding-projection pairs (ep pairs) are to
graduality what relations are to parametricity. We argue that casts between two
types where one is ""more dynamic"" (less precise) than the other necessarily
form an ep pair, and we use this to cleanly prove the graduality cases for
casts from the ep-pair property. To construct ep pairs, we give an analysis of
the type dynamism relation (also known as type precision or naive subtyping)
that interprets the rules for type dynamism as compositional constructions on
ep pairs, analogous to the coercion interpretation of subtyping.

suitable for the financial trading task and solve it with the state-of-the-art
deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) algorithm. We propose several modifications to
the existing learning algorithm to make it more suitable under the financial
trading setting, namely 1. We employ a substantially small replay memory (only
a few hundreds in size) compared to ones used in modern deep reinforcement
learning algorithms (often millions in size.) 2. We develop an action
augmentation technique to mitigate the need for random exploration by providing
extra feedback signals for all actions to the agent. This enables us to use
greedy policy over the course of learning and shows strong empirical
performance compared to more commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration. However,
this technique is specific to financial trading under a few market assumptions.
3. We sample a longer sequence for recurrent neural network training. A side
product of this mechanism is that we can now train the agent for every T steps.
This greatly reduces training time since the overall computation is down by a
factor of T. We combine all of the above into a complete online learning
algorithm and validate our approach on the spot foreign exchange market.

canonical ensemble may occur for random graphs whose size tends to infinity,
and is signaled by a non-zero specific relative entropy of the two ensembles.
In [3] and [4] it was shown that breaking occurs when the constraint is put on
the degree sequence (configuration model). It is not known what is the effect
on the relative entropy when the number of constraints is reduced, i.e., when
only part of the nodes are constrained in their degree (and the remaining nodes
are left unconstrained). Intuitively, the relative entropy is expected to
decrease. However, this is not a trivial issue because when constraints are
removed both the microcanonical ensemble and the canonical ensemble change. In
this paper a formula for the relative entropy valid for generic discrete random
structures, recently formulated by Squartini and Garlaschelli, is used to prove
that the relative entropy is monotone in the number of constraints when the
constraint is on the degrees of the nodes. It is further shown that the
expression for the relative entropy corresponds, in the dense regime, to the
degrees in the microcanonical ensemble being asymptotically multivariate Dirac
and in the canonical ensemble being asymptotically Gaussian.

the role of a spatial correlation of variable range in the finite system. We
find that, on ensemble average, the chain eigenstates become more fragmented
spatially for intermediate average symmetry domain sizes, depending on the
degree of disorder. This is caused by the partial formation of states with
approximate local parity confined within fictitious, disorder-induced double
wells and perturbed by the coupling to adjacent domains. The dynamical
evolution of wave-packets shows that the average site-resolved transfer
efficiency is enhanced between regions connected by local symmetry. The
transfer may further be drastically amplified in the presence of spatial
overlap between the symmetry domains, and in particular when global and local
symmetry coexist. Applicable to generic discrete models for matter and light
waves, our work provides a perspective to understand and exploit the impact of
local order at multiple scales in complex systems.

unresolved H_alpha in emission with pseudo equivalent widths (pEW) in the range
45-150 Angstroms and absorption lines of various alkalis with the typical

reusable knowledge for software architects. Several models have been described
in the literature, introducing necessary concepts and relations. These concepts
and relations were usually explained using natural language. Not much work has
been done so far on their formal definitions. Specifically, such a definition
of an architectural decision model is still missing. The purpose of this paper
is filling this gap by providing the formal definition of an architectural
decision model at both syntax and semantics levels. At the syntax level,
different concepts and relations that are elements of a model have been
mathematically defined. At the semantics level, the meaning of a model has been
defined in a form of denotational semantics. The formalization not only allows
for better understanding of architectural decision models but opens the
possibility to reason on such models, e.g., checking their consistency -
something that is very limited for the models proposed so far. A practical
example of the semantics of an architectural decision model is also presented.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is the ability of humans to learn one task at
a time. ANNs, on the other hand, can only learn multiple tasks simultaneously.
Any attempts at learning new tasks incrementally cause them to completely
forget about previous tasks. This lack of ability to learn incrementally,
called Catastrophic Forgetting, is considered a major hurdle in building a true
AI system. In this paper, our goal is to isolate the truly effective existing
ideas for incremental learning from those that only work under certain
conditions. To this end, we first thoroughly analyze the current state of the
art (iCaRL) method for incremental learning and demonstrate that the good
performance of the system is not because of the reasons presented in the
existing literature. We conclude that the success of iCaRL is primarily due to
knowledge distillation and recognize a key limitation of knowledge
distillation, i.e, it often leads to bias in classifiers. Finally, we propose a
dynamic threshold moving algorithm that is able to successfully remove this
bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on CIFAR100 and MNIST
datasets showing near-optimal results. Our implementation is available at

equivariant to input transformations, including rotation and reflection, which
improves the network efficiency and thus contributes to the segmentation
performance. We extensively evaluate our method on the ISIC 2017 skin lesion

Herein, we develop a novel solution method to synthesize 2D perovskite
single-crystals with the centimeter size, high phase purity, controllable
junction depth, high crystalline quality and great stability for highly narrow
dual-band photodetectors. On the basis of the different lattice constant,
solubility and growth rate between different n number, the newly designed

self-assembled layer of the organic cations at the water-air interface and
subsequently n=2 layer is formed via diffusion process. Such growth process
provides an efficient away for us to readily obtain 2D perovskite
heterostructural single-crystals with various thickness and junction depth by
controlling the concentration, reaction temperature and time. Photodetectors
based on such heterostructural single crystal plates exhibit extremely low dark

take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for
optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates
stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the
objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian
machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an
acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In
this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian
process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected
improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more
advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in
parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization,
expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task
Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude
with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research
directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a
generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the
noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is
justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to
previous ad hoc modifications.

because we allow the particles to arrive or leave the state space according to
prescribed protocols. We describe this system by looking at the population of
particles on every state by establishing the rules of time-evolution of the

distribution of particles over the state space through the corresponding moment
generating function. Such a description is given through the dynamics ruling
the behavior of such a moment generating function and we prove that the system
is able to attain the stationarity under some conditions. We also show that it

spin-flip. Thus, we interpret the results as an indirect observation of
strongly enhanced electron spin relaxation without magnetic field, possibly

learning community, graph-based methods are often unusable because of the lack
of mathematical operations defined in graph domain. Graph embedding, which maps
graphs to a vectorial space, has been proposed as a way to tackle these
difficulties enabling the use of standard machine learning techniques. However,
it is well known that graph embedding functions usually suffer from the loss of
structural information. In this paper, we consider the hierarchical structure
of a graph as a way to mitigate this loss of information. The hierarchical
structure is constructed by topologically clustering the graph nodes, and
considering each cluster as a node in the upper hierarchical level. Once this
hierarchical structure is constructed, we consider several configurations to
define the mapping into a vector space given a classical graph embedding, in
particular, we propose to make use of the Stochastic Graphlet Embedding (SGE).
Broadly speaking, SGE produces a distribution of uniformly sampled low to high
order graphlets as a way to embed graphs into the vector space. In what
follows, the coarse-to-fine structure of a graph hierarchy and the statistics
fetched by the SGE complements each other and includes important structural
information with varied contexts. Altogether, these two techniques
substantially cope with the usual information loss involved in graph embedding
techniques, obtaining a more robust graph representation. This fact has been
corroborated through a detailed experimental evaluation on various benchmark
graph datasets, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

dense objects capture dark matter particles very efficiently. It has recently
been shown that the energy transfer in the dark matter capture process can lead
to appreciable heating of neutron stars, which may be observable with
forthcoming infra-red telescopes. We examine this heating in the context of
inelastic dark matter, for which signals in conventional nuclear-recoil based
direct detection experiments are highly suppressed when the momentum transfer
is small compared to the mass splitting between dark matter states. Neutron
stars permit inelastic scattering for much greater mass splittings, because
dark matter particles are accelerated to velocities close to the speed of light
during infall. Using an effective operator approach for fermionic DM that
scatters inelastically, we show that the observation of a very cold neutron
star would lead to very stringent limits on the interaction strengths that, in
most cases, much stronger than any present, or future, direct detection
experiment on Earth. This holds both for elastic scattering and for inelastic
scattering with mass splittings up to $\sim 300 MeV$.

Hendel","On twisted Gelfand pairs through commutativity of a Hecke algebra","Final version following referee's remarks. 22 pages, comments welcome",,"10.1093/imrn/rnz107",,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a locally compact, totally disconnected group $G$, a subgroup $H$ and a
character $\chi:H \to \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ we define a Hecke algebra
$\mathcal{H}_\chi$ and explore the connection between commutativity of
$\mathcal{H}_\chi$ and the $\chi$-Gelfand property of $(G,H)$, i.e. the
property $\mathrm{dim}_\mathbb{C}(\rho^*)^{(H,\chi^{-1})} \leq 1$ for every
$\rho \in \mathrm{Irr}(G)$, the irreducible representations of $G$.
  We show that the conditions of the Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion imply
commutativity of $\mathcal{H}_\chi$, and verify in several simple cases that
commutativity of $\mathcal{H}_\chi$ is equivalent to the $\chi$-Gelfand
property of $(G,H)$.
  We then show that if $G$ is a connected reductive group over a $p$-adic field
$F$, and $G/H$ is $F$-spherical, then the cuspidal part of $\mathcal{H}_\chi$
is commutative if and only if $(G,H)$ satisfies the $\chi$-Gelfand property
with respect to all cuspidal representations ${\rho \in \mathrm{Irr}(G)}$.
  We conclude by showing that if $(G,H)$ satisfies the $\chi$-Gelfand property
with respect to all irreducible $(H,\chi^{-1})$-tempered representations of $G$
then $\mathcal{H}_\chi$ is commutative.

  Joint Video Prediction",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The explosion of video data on the internet requires effective and efficient
technology to generate captions automatically for people who are not able to
watch the videos. Despite the great progress of video captioning research,
particularly on video feature encoding, the language decoder is still largely
based on the prevailing RNN decoder such as LSTM, which tends to prefer the
frequent word that aligns with the video. In this paper, we propose a
boundary-aware hierarchical language decoder for video captioning, which
consists of a high-level GRU based language decoder, working as a global
(caption-level) language model, and a low-level GRU based language decoder,
working as a local (phrase-level) language model. Most importantly, we
introduce a binary gate into the low-level GRU language decoder to detect the
language boundaries. Together with other advanced components including joint
video prediction, shared soft attention, and boundary-aware video encoding, our
integrated video captioning framework can discover hierarchical language
information and distinguish the subject and the object in a sentence, which are
usually confusing during the language generation. Extensive experiments on two
widely-used video captioning datasets, MSR-Video-to-Text (MSR-VTT)
\cite{xu2016msr} and YouTube-to-Text (MSVD) \cite{chen2011collecting} show that
our method is highly competitive, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
