different phases, and we focus in the regime where cluster crystals form. We

clusters also show an ordered structure (crystal cluster-crystal phase), and
the one occurring at higher temperature in which particles within the clusters
are spatially disordered (fluid cluster crystal). An explicit expression for
the energy in terms of the typical distance among clusters and the typical

temperature, which helps to understand the balance between the different forces

prediction in a taxi journey. Predicting the next location is a well studied
problem in human mobility, which finds several applications in real-world

predicting and reducing the traffic jam. This task is normally modeled as a
multiclass classification problem, where the goal is to select, among a set of

Neural Network (RNN) approach that models the taxi drivers' behaviour and
encodes the semantics of visited locations by using geographical information
from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). In particular, RNNs are trained to
predict the exact coordinates of the next destination, overcoming the problem
of producing, in output, a limited set of locations, seen during the training
phase. The proposed approach was tested on the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge
2015 dataset - based on the city of Porto -, obtaining better results with
respect to the competition winner, whilst using less information, and on

Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'{a}sz also works for $\tilde{m}^\ast_2(r)$, we show that the
trivial lower bound $\tilde{m}_2(r) \geqslant 2^{r-1}$ is asymptotically tight,

2^{r-1}$ is not sharp, i.e., $\tilde{m}_2(r) \geqslant 2^{r-1}+1$. Whether this
result holds for any odd values of $r$ remains an open problem. Nevertheless,
we conjecture that the difference $\tilde{m}_2(r) - 2^{r-1}$ can be arbitrarily
large.

applied to numerous problems that require processing sequences, such as image
captioning, machine translation, and text recognition. However, RNNs often
struggle to generalise to sequences longer than the ones encountered during
training. In this work, we propose to optimise neural networks explicitly for
induction. The idea is to first decompose the problem in a sequence of
inductive steps and then to explicitly train the RNN to reproduce such steps.
Generalisation is achieved as the RNN is not allowed to learn an arbitrary
internal state; instead, it is tasked with mimicking the evolution of a valid
state. In particular, the state is restricted to a spatial memory map that
tracks parts of the input image which have been accounted for in previous
steps. The RNN is trained for single inductive steps, where it produces updates
to the memory in addition to the desired output. We evaluate our method on two
different visual recognition problems involving visual sequences: (1) text
spotting, i.e. joint localisation and reading of text in images containing
multiple lines (or a block) of text, and (2) sequential counting of objects in
aerial images. We show that inductive training of recurrent models enhances
their generalisation ability on challenging image datasets.

The Gasca - Maeztu conjecture (1982) states that every $GC_n$ set has a maximal

  Either the line $\ell$ is not used at all, or it is used by exactly
$\binom{s}{2}$ nodes of $\mathcal X,$ where $s$ satisfies the condition
$\sigma:=2k-n-1\le s\le k.$ If in addition $\sigma \ge 3$ and $\mu(\mathcal

necessarily a used line. Here $\mu(\mathcal X)$ denotes the number of maximal

graphene with a twist angle equal to the so-called `first magic angle'. The
system low-energy single-electron spectrum consists of four (eight, if spin
label is accounted) weakly-dispersing partially degenerate bands, each band
accommodating one electron per Moir{\'{e}} cell per spin projection. This weak
dispersion makes electrons particularly susceptible to the effects of
interactions. Introducing several excitonic order parameters with
spin-density-wave-like structure, we demonstrate that (i)~the band degeneracy
is partially lifted by the interaction, and (ii)~the details of the low-energy
spectrum becomes doping-dependent. For example, at or near the undoped state,
interactions separate the eight bands into two quartets (one quartet is almost
filled, the other is almost empty), while for two electrons per Moir\'{e} cell,
the quartets are pulled apart, and doublets emerge. When the doping is equal to
one or three electrons per cell, the doublets split into singlets. Hole doping
produces similar effects. As a result, electronic properties (e.g., the density
of states at the Fermi energy) demonstrate oscillating dependence on the doping
concentration. This allows us to reproduce qualitatively the behavior of the
conductance observed recently in experiments [Cao et al., Nature {\bf 556}, 80
(2018)]. Near half-filling, the electronic spectrum loses hexagonal symmetry
indicating the appearance of a many-body nematic state.

shoulder of the vibrational density of states and fast oscillations of the
autocorrelations of rotational velocities. A lattice-based model describes the
dispersion relations of the rotational modes for small wave numbers. The
rotational modes are perfectly explained by the model if tangential elastic
forces between the disks in contact are large enough. If the tangential forces
are comparable with or smaller than normal forces, the model fails for short
wave lengths. However, the dispersion relation of the rotational modes then
follows the model prediction for transverse modes, implying that the fast

such a transition of the rotational modes by analyzing the eigen vectors of

properties in safety critical cyber-physical systems by observing its
executions. Bauer et al. introduced an influential framework for monitoring
Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties based on a three-valued semantics: the
formula is already satisfied by the given prefix, it is already violated, or it
is still undetermined, i.e., it can still be satisfied and violated by
appropriate extensions. However, a wide range of formulas are not monitorable
under this approach, meaning that they have a prefix for which satisfaction and
violation will always remain undetermined no matter how it is extended. In
particular, Bauer et al. report that 44% of the formulas they consider in their
experiments fall into this category.
  Recently, a robust semantics for LTL was introduced to capture different
degrees by which a property can be violated. In this paper we introduce a
robust semantics for finite strings and show its potential in monitoring: every
formula considered by Bauer et al. is monitorable under our approach.
Furthermore, we discuss which properties that come naturally in LTL monitoring
- such as the realizability of all truth values - can be transferred to the
robust setting. Lastly, we show that LTL formulas with robust semantics can be
monitored by deterministic automata and report on a prototype implementation.

nearby stars is a significant obstacle for future exo-Earth imaging missions.
We executed an N band nulling interferometric survey to determine the typical
amount of such exozodiacal dust around a sample of nearby main sequence stars.
The majority of our data have been analyzed and we present here an update of
our ongoing work. We find seven new N band excesses in addition to the high
confidence confirmation of three that were previously known. We find the first
detections around Sun-like stars and around stars without previously known
circumstellar dust. Our overall detection rate is 23%. The inferred occurrence
rate is comparable for early type and Sun-like stars, but decreases from 71%
[+11%/-20%] for stars with previously detected mid- to far-infrared excess to
11% [+9%/-4%] for stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at high
confidence. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is
five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal luminosity
function of the dust, we find upper limits on the median dust level around all
stars without previously known mid to far infrared excess of 11.5 zodis at 95%
confidence level. The corresponding upper limit for Sun-like stars is 16 zodis.
An LBTI vetted target list of Sun-like stars for exo-Earth imaging would have a
corresponding limit of 7.5 zodis. We provide important new insights into the
occurrence rate and typical levels of habitable zone dust around main sequence
stars. Exploiting the full range of capabilities of the LBTI provides a
critical opportunity for the detailed characterization of a sample of
exozodiacal dust disks to understand the origin, distribution, and properties
of the dust.

dust found in the inner regions of planetary systems around main sequence
stars. In analogy to our own zodiacal dust, it may be located in or near the
habitable zone or closer in, down to the dust sublimation distance. The study
of the properties, distribution, and evolution of exozodis can inform about the
architecture and dynamics of the innermost regions of planetary systems, close
to their habitable zones. On the other hand, the presence of large amounts of
exo-zodiacal dust may be an obstacle for future space missions aiming to image
Earth-like exoplanets. The dust can be the most luminous component of
extrasolar planetary systems, but predominantly emits in the near- to
mid-infrared where it is outshone by the host star. Interferometry provides a
unique method of separating the dusty from the stellar emission. We discuss the
prospects of exozodi observations with the next generation VLTI instruments and
summarize critical instrument specifications.

increasing and sharply suppressed after the dimerization. We propose that the

coma of US10, assess and monitor the physical properties of the ice as
insolation varies with heliocentric distance, and investigate the relationship
between water ice and CO$_{2}$. This set of measurements is unique in orbital
coverage and can be used to infer the physical evolution of the ice and,
potentially, the nucleus composition. We report (1) nearly identical
near-infrared spectroscopic measurements of the coma at $-$5.8 au, $-$5.0 au,
+3.9 au (where $<$0 au indicates pre-perihelion epochs), all presenting
evidence of water-ice grains, (2) a dust-dominated coma at 1.3 au and 2.3 au
and, (3) an increasing CO$_{2}$/$Af\rho$ ratio from $-$4.9 au to 1.8 au. We
propose that sublimation of the hyper-volatile CO$_{2}$ is responsible for
dragging water-ice grains into the coma throughout the orbit. Once in the coma,
the observability of the water-ice grains is controlled by the ice grain
sublimation lifetime, which seems to require some small dust contaminant (i.e.,
non-pure ice grains). At |R$_{h}$|>=3.9 au, the ice grains are long-lived and
may be unchanged since leaving the comet nucleus. We find the nucleus of comet

challenges in cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications.
On one hand, the LoS channels make more cellular base stations (BSs) visible to
a UAV as compared to the ground users, which leads to a higher macro-diversity
gain for UAV-BS communications. On the other hand, they also render the UAV to
impose/suffer more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the BSs, thus
requiring more sophisticated inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC)
techniques with more BSs involved. In this paper, we consider the uplink
transmission from a UAV to cellular BSs, under spectrum sharing with the
existing ground users. To investigate the optimal ICIC design and air-ground
performance trade-off, we maximize the weighted sum-rate of the UAV and
existing ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV's uplink cell associations
and power allocations over multiple resource blocks. However, this problem is
non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. We first propose a centralized
ICIC design to obtain a locally optimal solution based on the successive convex
approximation (SCA) method. As the centralized ICIC requires global information
of the network and substantial information exchange among an excessively large
number of BSs, we further propose a decentralized ICIC scheme of significantly
lower complexity and signaling overhead for implementation, by dividing the
cellular BSs into small-size clusters and exploiting the LoS macro-diversity
for exchanging information between the UAV and cluster-head BSs only. Numerical
results show that the proposed centralized and decentralized ICIC schemes both
achieve a near-optimal performance, and draw important design insights based on
practical system setups.

approaches for Android apps. However, due to the evolution of Android platforms
and malware, existing such techniques are widely limited by their need for
constant retraining that are costly, and reliance on new malware samples that
may not be timely available. As a result, new and emerging malware slips
through, as seen from the continued surging of malware in the wild. Thus, a
more practical detector needs not only to be accurate but, more critically, to
be able to sustain its capabilities over time without frequent retraining. In
this paper, we study how Android apps evolve as a population over time, in
terms of their behaviors related to accesses to sensitive information and
operations. We first perform a longitudinal characterization of 6K benign and
malicious apps developed across seven years, with focus on these sensitive
accesses in app executions. Our study reveals, during the long evolution, a
consistent, clear differentiation between malware and benign apps regarding
such accesses, measured by relative statistics of relevant method calls.
Following these findings, we developed DroidSpan, a novel classification system
based on a new behavioral profile for Android apps. Through an extensive
evaluation, we showed that DroidSpan can not only effectively detect malware
but sustain high detection accuracy (93% F1 measure) for four years (with 81%
F1 for five years). Through a dedicated study, we also showed its resiliency to
sophisticated evasion schemes. By comparing to a state-of-the-art malware
detector, we demonstrated the largely superior sustainability of our approach
at reasonable costs.

  Variational Approach","Final version accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (in press as
  of August 2019)",,,,"cs.AI cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work develops novel strategies for optimal planning with semantic
observations using continuous state partially observable markov decision
processes (CPOMDPs). Two major innovations are presented in relation to
Gaussian mixture (GM) CPOMDP policy approximation methods. While existing
methods have many desirable theoretical properties, they are unable to
efficiently represent and reason over hybrid continuous-discrete probabilistic
models. The first major innovation is the derivation of closed-form variational
Bayes GM approximations of Point-Based Value Iteration Bellman policy backups,
using softmax models of continuous-discrete semantic observation probabilities.
A key benefit of this approach is that dynamic decision-making tasks can be
performed with complex non-Gaussian uncertainties, while also exploiting
continuous dynamic state space models (thus avoiding cumbersome and costly
discretization). The second major innovation is a new clustering-based
technique for mixture condensation that scales well to very large GM policy
functions and belief functions. Simulation results for a target search and
interception task with semantic observations show that the GM policies
resulting from these innovations are more effective than those produced by
other state of the art policy approximations, but require significantly less
modeling overhead and online runtime cost. Additional results show the
robustness of this approach to model errors and scaling to higher dimensions.

initiation that includes the role of turbulence. Upon increasing the wind shear
stress $\tau$ above a threshold value $\tau^\prime_t$, particles resting at the
bed surface begin to rock in their pockets because the largest turbulent
fluctuations of the instantaneous wind velocity above its mean value
$\overline{u}$ induce fluid torques that exceed resisting torques. Upon a
slight further increase of $\tau$, rocking turns into a rolling regime (i.e.,
rolling threshold $\tau_t\simeq\tau^\prime_t$) provided that the ratio between
the integral time scale $T_i\propto\delta/\overline{u}$ (where $\delta$ is the
boundary layer thickness) and the time $T_e\propto\sqrt{d/[(1-1/s)g]}$ required
for entrainment (where $d$ is the particle diameter and $s$ the
particle-air-density ratio) is sufficiently large. Rolling then evolves into
mean-wind-sustained saltation transport provided that the mean wind is able to
compensate energy losses from particle-bed rebounds. However, when $T_i/T_e$ is
too small, the threshold ratio scales as
$\tau_t/\tau^\prime_t\propto{T}_e/T_i\propto{s}d^2/\delta^2$, consistent with
experiments. Because $\delta/d$ controls $T_i/T_e$ and the relative amplitude
of turbulent wind velocity fluctuations, we qualitatively predict that Aeolian
sediment transport in natural atmospheres can be initiated under weaker
(potentially much weaker) winds than in wind tunnels, consistent with indirect
observational evidence on Earth and Mars.

Formally, given a set $S$ of $n$ positive integers and a target integer $t$,
the Subset Sum problem is to decide if there is a subset of $S$ that sums up to
$t$. Dynamic programming yields an algorithm with running time $O(nt)$.
Recently, the authors [SODA '17] improved the running time to
$\tilde{O}\bigl(\sqrt{n}t\bigr)$, and it was further improved to
$\tilde{O}\bigl(n+t\bigr)$ by a somewhat involved randomized algorithm by
Bringmann [SODA '17], where $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors.

characteristics of quantum well and quantum dot lasers; in the latter, it also
improves the temperature performance. The advantage of the tunneling injection
process stems from the fact that it avoids hot carrier injection, which is a
key performance-limiting factor in all semiconductor lasers. The tunneling
injection process is not fully understood microscopically and therefore it is
difficult to optimize those laser structures. We present here a numerical study
of the broad band carrier dynamics in a tunneling injection quantum dot gain
medium in the form of an optical amplifier operating at 1.55 um. Charge carrier
tunneling occurs in a hybrid state that joins the quantum dot first excited
state and the confined quantum well - injection well states. The hybrid state,
which is placed energetically roughly one LO phonon above the ground state and
has a spectral extent of about 5 meV , dominates the carrier injection to the
ground state. We calculate the dynamical response of the inversion across the
entire gain spectrum following a short pulse perturbation at various
wavelengths and for two bias currents. At a high bias of 200 mA, the entire
spectrum exhibits gain; at 30 mA, the system exhibits a mixed gain - absorption
spectrum. The carrier dynamics in the injection well is calculated
simultaneously. We discuss the role of the pulse excitation wavelengths
relative to the gain spectrum peak and demonstrate that the injection well
responds to all perturbation wavelengths, even those which are far from the
region where the tunneling injection process dominates.

Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations. We use the
largest reference model Ref-L100N1504, a cubic cosmological volume of 100
comoving megaparsecs on a side, to identify and characterise these systems
through cosmic time. The number density of ring galaxies in EAGLE is in broad
agreement with the observations. The vast majority of ring galaxies identified
in EAGLE (83 per cent) have an interaction origin, i.e., form when one or more
companion galaxies drop-through a disk galaxy. The remainder (17 per cent) have
very long-lived ring morphologies (> 2 Gyr) and host strong bars. Ring galaxies
are HI rich galaxies, yet display inefficient star formation activity and tend
to reside in the green valley particularly at z > 0.5. This inefficiency is
mainly due to the low pressure and metallicity of their interstellar medium
(ISM) compared with the ISM of similar star-forming galaxies. We find that the
interaction(s) is responsible for decreasing the ISM pressure by causing the
ISM gas to flow from the inner regions to the outer disk, where the ring
feature forms. At a fixed radius, the star formation efficiency of ring
galaxies is indistinguishable from their star-forming counterparts, and thus
the main reason for their integrated lower efficiency is the different gas
surface density profiles. Since galaxy morphologies are not used to tune the
parameters in hydrodynamical simulations, the experiment performed here
demonstrates the success of the current numerical models in EAGLE.

correlated to each other in hand-object manipulation. In the proposed model, we
explore various semantic relationships between actions, grasp types and object

low-level local inconsistency and high-level semantic inconsistency. The
introduction of the adversarial network tackles the two problems using a single
discriminator. However, the two types of parsing inconsistency are generated by
distinct mechanisms, so it is difficult for a single discriminator to solve
them both. To address the two kinds of inconsistencies, this paper proposes the
Macro-Micro Adversarial Net (MMAN). It has two discriminators. One
discriminator, Macro D, acts on the low-resolution label map and penalizes
semantic inconsistency, e.g., misplaced body parts. The other discriminator,
Micro D, focuses on multiple patches of the high-resolution label map to
address the local inconsistency, e.g., blur and hole. Compared with traditional
adversarial networks, MMAN not only enforces local and semantic consistency
explicitly, but also avoids the poor convergence problem of adversarial
networks when handling high resolution images. In our experiment, we validate
that the two discriminators are complementary to each other in improving the
human parsing accuracy. The proposed framework is capable of producing
competitive parsing performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods,
i.e., mIoU=46.81% and 59.91% on LIP and PASCAL-Person-Part, respectively. On a

theory. To this end, we consider a simplified yet Earth-like general
circulation model of the atmosphere and numerically estimate large deviation
rate functions of near-surface temperature in the mid-latitudes. We find that,
after a re-normalisation based on the integrated auto-correlation, the rate
function one obtains at a given latitude by looking, locally in space, at long
time averages agrees with what is obtained, instead, by looking, locally in
time, at large spatial averages along the latitude. This is a result of scale
symmetry in the spatial-temporal turbulence and of the fact that advection is
primarily zonal. This agreement hints at the universality of large deviations
of the temperature field. Furthermore, we discover that the obtained rate
function is able to describe spatially extended and temporally persistent heat
waves or cold spells, if we consider temporal averages of spatial averages over
intermediate spatial scales. Finally, we find out that large deviations are
relatively more likely to occur when looking at these spatial averages
performed over intermediate scales, thus pointing to the existence of weather
patterns associated to the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere. Extreme
value theory is used to benchmark our results.

gravity which should be resolved through physical means. In general
relativity(GR), the static spherically symmetric(SSS) solution to the Einstein
equation is a benchmark and its deformation also plays a crucial role in
mimetic gravity. The equation of motion is provided with high nonlinearity, but
we can reduce primal nonlinearity to a frequent Riccati form in the SSS case of
mimetic gravity. In other words, we obtain an expression of solution to the
functional differential equation of motion with any potential function.
Remarkably, we proved rigorously that there is a zero point of first order for
the metric function $\beta(r)$ if another metric function $\alpha(r)$ possesses
a pole of first order within mimetic gravity. The zero point theorem may be
regarded as the generalization of Birkhoff theorem $\alpha\beta=1$ in GR. As a
corollary, we show that there is a modified black hole solution for any given
$V(\phi)$, which can pass the test of solar system. As another corollary, the
zero point theorem provides a dynamical mechanism for the maximum size of
galaxies. Especially, there are two analytic solutions which provide good fits
to the rotation curves of galaxies without the demand for particle dark matter.

is changed periodically following a covisibility-based strategy. The second
thread is a back-end which receives keyframes from the front-end. This thread
is in charge of segmenting the keyframes based on their structure, describing
them using Bags of Words, trying to find potential loop closures with previous
keyframes, and in such case perform pose-graph optimisation for trajectory
correction. In addition, our system allows is able to compute the odometry both
with unregistered and registered depth maps, allowing to use customised
calibrations of the RGB-D sensor. As a consequence in the paper we also propose
a detailed calibration pipeline to compute customised calibrations for

modes that are capable of achieving a strong confinement of electromagnetic
waves and immune to impurities and disorder. Here we realize TPhPs by
constructing one-dimensional dimerized silicon carbide nanoparticle chains,
which mimic the topological property of the well-known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) model. We analytically calculate the complex band structure of such
chains by taking all near-field and far-field dipole-dipole interactions into
account. For longitudinal modes, we demonstrate that, despite the
non-Hermiticity and breaking of the chiral symmetry, the band topology can be
still characterized by the complex Zak phase, which is quantized and indicates
a topological phase transition when the dimerization parameter $\beta$ changes
from less than 0.5 to larger than 0.5, like the conventional Hermitian SSH
model. By calculating the eigenmodes of a finite chain, we find such a
dimerized chain with $\beta>0.5$ supports nontrivial topological eigenmodes
localized over both of its edges, indicating the validity of the bulk-boundary
correspondence. On the other hand, for transverse modes, we discover a
topological phase transition by increasing the lattice constant, which is due
to the presence of strong long-range far-field transverse dipole-dipole
interactions decaying with the distance $r$ as $1/r$ for an infinitely long
chain. However, we surprisingly find the emergence of non-Hermitian skin effect
in a finite chain, which leads to the breakdown of the bulk-boundary
correspondence. Furthermore, by incorporating the effect of localized bulk
eigenmodes and proposing a modified complex Zak phase for a finite lattice, we
still recover the topological behavior of the conventional SSH model. We also
demonstrate the excitation of topological phonon polaritons and show their

which is freely suspended in an infinite dielectric medium and subjected to an
imposed electric field. The electric potential in the drop phase is assumed
small, so that its governing equation is approximated by a linearized
Poisson-Boltzmann or modified Helmholtz equation (the Debye-H\""{u}ckel regime).
An accurate and efficient boundary integral method is developed to solve the
low-Reynolds-number flow problem for the time-dependent drop deformation, in
the case of arbitrary Debye layer thickness. Extensive numerical results are
presented for the case when the viscosity of the drop and surrounding medium
are comparable. Qualitative similarities are found between the evolution of a
drop with a thick Debye layer (characterized by the parameter $\chi\ll 1$,
which is an inverse dimensionless Debye layer thickness) and a perfect
dielectric drop in an insulating medium. In this limit, a highly elongated
steady state is obtained for sufficiently large imposed electric field, and the
field inside the drop is found to be well approximated using slender body
theory. In the opposite limit $\chi\gg 1$, when the Debye layer is thin, the
drop behaves as a highly conducting drop, even for moderate permittivity ratio
$Q=\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2$, where $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2$ is the dielectric
permittivity of drop interior and exterior, respectively. For parameter values
at which steady solutions no longer exist, we find three distinct types of
unsteady solution or breakup modes. These are termed conical end formation, end
splashing, and open end stretching. The second breakup mode, end splashing,
resembles the breakup solution presented in a recent paper [R. B. Karyappa et

virtually any combination of atomically thin crystals of van der Waals bonded
compounds to form new types of heterostructures and interfaces. As a result,
there is the need to understand at a quantitative level how the interfacial
properties are determined by the properties of the constituent 2D materials. We
address this problem by studying the transport and optoelectronic response of
two different interfaces based on transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers,
namely WSe2-MoSe2 and WSe2-MoS2. By exploiting the spectroscopic capabilities
of ionic liquid gated transistors, we show how the conduction and valence bands
of the individual monolayers determine the bands of the interface, and we
establish quantitatively (directly from the measurements) the energetic
alignment of the bands in the different materials as well as the magnitude of
the interfacial band gap. Photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements allow
us to conclude that the band gap of the WSe2-MoSe2 interface is direct in k
space, whereas the gap of WSe2/MoS2 is indirect. For WSe2/MoSe2, we detect the
light emitted from the decay of interlayer excitons and determine
experimentally their binding energy using the values of the interfacial band
gap extracted from transport measurements. The technique that we employed to
reach this conclusion demonstrates a rather-general strategy for characterizing
quantitatively the interfacial properties in terms of the properties of the
constituent atomic layers. The results presented here further illustrate how
van der Waals interfaces of two distinct 2D semiconducting materials are
composite systems that truly behave as artificial semiconductors, the
properties of which can be deterministically defined by the selection of the
appropriate constituent semiconducting monolayers.

detection in predefined tumor regions. However, in a real-world scenario,
automatic mitosis detection should be performed in whole-slide images (WSIs)
and an automatic method should be able to produce a tumor proliferation score
given a WSI as input. To address this, we organized the TUmor Proliferation
Assessment Challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) on prediction of tumor proliferation scores
from WSIs. The challenge dataset consisted of 500 training and 321 testing
breast cancer histopathology WSIs. In order to ensure fair and independent
evaluation, only the ground truth for the training dataset was provided to the
challenge participants. The first task of the challenge was to predict mitotic
scores, i.e., to reproduce the manual method of assessing tumor proliferation
by a pathologist. The second task was to predict the gene expression based
PAM50 proliferation scores from the WSI. The best performing automatic method
for the first task achieved a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa score of
$\kappa$ = 0.567, 95% CI [0.464, 0.671] between the predicted scores and the
ground truth. For the second task, the predictions of the top method had a
Spearman's correlation coefficient of r = 0.617, 95% CI [0.581 0.651] with the
ground truth. This was the first study that investigated tumor proliferation
assessment from WSIs. The achieved results are promising given the difficulty
of the tasks and weakly-labelled nature of the ground truth. However, further
research is needed to improve the practical utility of image analysis methods
for this task.

by Reiner, Tenner and Yong in their study of the probability distribution of
edges in the Young lattice of partitions. Given a partition $\lambda$ and a
positive integer $k$, let ${\mathrm{BSSYT}}(\lambda,k)$ (respectively,
${\mathrm{SYT}}(\lambda,k)$) denote the set of barely set-valued semistandard
Young tableaux (respectively, ordinary semistandard Young tableaux) of shape
$\lambda$ with entries in row $i$ not exceeding $k+i$. In the case when
$\lambda$ is a rectangular staircase partition $\delta_d(b^a)$, Reiner, Tenner
and Yong conjectured that $|{\mathrm{BSSYT}}(\lambda,k)|=
\frac{kab(d-1)}{(a+b)} |{\mathrm{SYT}}(\lambda,k)|$. In this paper, we
establish a connection between barely set-valued tableaux and reverse plane
partitions with designated corners. We show that for any shape $\lambda$, the
expected jaggedness of a subshape of $\lambda$ under the weak probability
distribution can be expressed as $\frac{2|{\mathrm{BSSYT}}(\lambda,k)|}
{k|{\mathrm{SYT}}(\lambda,k)|}$. On the other hand, when $\lambda$ is a
balanced shape with $r$ rows and $c$ columns, Chan, Haddadan, Hopkins and Moci
proved that the expected jaggedness of a subshape in $\lambda$ under the weak
distribution equals $2rc/(r+c)$. Hence, for a balanced shape $\lambda$ with $r$
rows and $c$ columns, we establish the relation that
$|{\mathrm{BSSYT}}(\lambda,k)|=\frac{krc}{(r+c)}|{\mathrm{SYT}}(\lambda,k)|$.
Since a rectangular staircase shape $\delta_d(b^a)$ is a balanced shape, we
confirm the conjecture of Reiner, Tenner and Yong.

drain) and the contact length (distance that source and drain interface with
semiconducting channel). Contact length scaling remains an unresolved epidemic
for transistor scaling, affecting devices from all semiconductors, from silicon

immunity to the contact-scaling problem, with performance that is independent
of contact length down to the 20 nm regime. Using a directional ion beam, in
situ edge contacts of various metal-MoS2 interfaces are studied.
Characterization of the intricate edge interface using cross-sectional electron
microscopy reveals distinct morphological effects on the MoS2 depending on its
thickness, from monolayer to few-layer films. Chromium is found to outperform
other metals in the edge contact scheme, which is attributed to the shorter
Cr-MoS2 bond length. Compared to scaled top contacts with 20 nm contact length,
in situ edge contacts yield better performance with an effective contact length
of ~ 1 nm and 18 times higher carrier injection efficiency. The in situ edge
contacts also exhibit ~8 times higher performance compared to the best-reported

The first and second groups consider the mathematical models of the scanning

design of closed loop tracking control systems of both the large and small
mirror actuators. The control of each one system is synthesized as a near
time-optimal control of the precise linear model of the mirror actuator. The

stars, are highly sensitive to the physical properties of the innermost
regions. Measuring their properties is therefore extremely important to probe
the core, but requires some care, due to the complexity of the mixed-mode
pattern. This work aims at providing a consistent description of the mixed-mode
pattern of low-mass stars, based on the asymptotic expansion. We also aim at
studying the variation of the gravity offset $\varepsilon_{g}$ with stellar
evolution. We revisit previous work about mixed modes in red giants and
empirically test how period spacings, rotational splittings, mixed-mode widths
and heights can be estimated in a consistent view, based on the properties of
the mode inertia ratios. From the asymptotic fit of the mixed-mode pattern of a
large set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased and
precise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity modes is
verified with a precision close to the frequency resolution for stars on the
red giant branch (10$^{-4}$ in relative values), we can derive accurate values
of the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the complex pattern in a rapidly
rotating star, and explain how asymmetrical splittings can be inferred, as well
as the stellar inclinations. This allows us to revisit the stellar inclinations
in two open clusters, NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the stellar
inclinations in these clusters do not have privileged orientation in the sky.
The variation of the asymptotic gravity offset along with stellar evolution is
investigated in detail. We also derive generic properties that explain under
which conditions mixed modes can be observed.

detection and removal. As such, the early detection is crucial to protect user
data and files of being held to ransom. Several solutions have proposed
utilizing the data extracted during the initial phases of the attacks before
the encryption takes place. However, the lack of enough data at the early
phases of the attack along with high dimensional features space renders the
model prone to overfitting which decreases its detection accuracy. To this end,
this paper proposed a novel redundancy coefficient gradual up-weighting
approach that was incorporated to the calculation of redundancy term of mutual
information to improve the feature selection process and enhance the accuracy
of the detection model. Several machine learning classifiers were used to
evaluate the detection performance of the proposed techniques. The experimental
results show that the accuracy of proposed techniques achieved higher detection
accuracy. Those results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques for
the early detection tasks.

introduced. The particle is described by two scalar wavefunctions, and two

electromagnetic field will satisfy a quantum Telegraph equation instead of a
pure wave equation. This equation resembles the motion of the electromagnetic
field in a conducting medium. With a particular setting of the scalar and
vector wavefunctions, the dual quantum equations are found to yield the
quantized Maxwell's equations. The total energy of the particle is related to
the phase velocity ($v_p$) of the wave representing it by $E=p\,|v_p|$\,, where
$p$ is the matter wave momentum. A particular solution which describes the
process under which the particle undergoes a creation and annihilation is
derived. The force acting on the moving particle is expressed in a dual
Lorentz-like form. If the particle moves like a fluid, a dissipative (drag)

aims at investigating the perceptions of hospitality students at the Faculty of
Tourism in Alexandria University towards the industry as a career choice. A
self-administrated questionnaire was developed to rate the importance of 20
factors in influencing career choice, and the extent to which hospitality as a
career offers these factors. From the results, it is clear that students
generally do not believe that the hospitality career will offer them the
factors they found important. However, most of respondents (70.6%) indicated
that they would work in the industry after graduation. Finally, a set of
specific remedial actions that hospitality stakeholders could initiate to
improve the perceptions of hospitality career are discussed.

function driven by the quadratic Wasserstien metric. Compared to conventional
Bayesian models based on Gaussian likelihood functions driven by the
least-squares norm ($L_2$ norm), the new framework features several advantages.
First, the new framework does not rely on the likelihood of the measurement
noise and hence can treat complicated noise structures such as combined
additive and multiplicative noise. Secondly, unlike the normal likelihood
function, the Wasserstein-based exponential likelihood function does not
usually generate multiple local extrema. As a result, the new framework
features better convergence to correct posteriors when a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling algorithm is employed. Thirdly, in the particular case of signal
processing problems, while a normal likelihood function measures only the
amplitude differences between the observed and simulated signals, the new
likelihood function can capture both the amplitude and the phase differences.
We apply the new framework to a class of signal processing problems, that is,
the inverse uncertainty quantification of waveforms, and demonstrate its
advantages compared to Bayesian models with normal likelihood functions.

  algorithm","8 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear combination of unitaries (LCU for short) is one of the most important
techniques in designing quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new
quantum algorithm in three different forms to achieve LCU. Different from
previous algorithms [Childs-linear-system,Clader,Long11], the complexity now
only depends on the number of the unitaries and the precision. So it will play
more important role in the design of quantum algorithms when the number of
unitaries is small, such as quantum iteration algorithms. %Since in iteration
algorithms, $m$ often refers to the iteration steps, which is small if the
iteration algorithms are efficient. Moreover, as an application of the new LCU,
three new quantum algorithms to the searching problem will be proposed, which
will provide us new insights into Grover's searching algorithm. We also show
that the problem of LCU is closely related to the problem of if we can
efficiently implement $U^t$ for $0<t<1$ when $U$ is an efficiently implemented
unitary operator? This problem is not hard to solve. However, it becomes
inefficient when it contains a strict requirement on precision, such as in
Grover's algorithm. Finally, as an application of the new LCU technique, we
will show that the quantum state of any real classical vector can be prepared
efficiently in quantum computer. So this solves the ""input problem"" in quantum
computer efficiently.

  Hyperspectral Image",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes an adaptive trace lasso regularized L1-norm based graph
cut method for dimensionality reduction of Hyperspectral images, called as
`Trace Lasso-L1 Graph Cut' (TL-L1GC). The underlying idea of this method is to
generate the optimal projection matrix by considering both the sparsity as well
as the correlation of the data samples. The conventional L2-norm used in the
objective function is sensitive to noise and outliers. Therefore, in this work
L1-norm is utilized as a robust alternative to L2-norm. Besides, for further
improvement of the results, we use a penalty function of trace lasso with the
L1GC method. It adaptively balances the L2-norm and L1-norm simultaneously by
considering the data correlation along with the sparsity. We obtain the optimal
projection matrix by maximizing the ratio of between-class dispersion to
within-class dispersion using L1-norm with trace lasso as the penalty.
Furthermore, an iterative procedure for this TL-L1GC method is proposed to
solve the optimization function. The effectiveness of this proposed method is
evaluated on two benchmark HSI datasets.

the NJL framework in the ultraviolet (UV) limit of the HL theory, with critical
exponent $z=3$, to demonstrate in the IR limit that the symmetry of the
potential at the critical coupling value is broken at $z=1$. We also derive the
effective Higgs-like potential in the low energy regimes. Here the symmetry of
the effective potential will be broken near $z=1$ at a certain value of the
critical coupling. In our scenario, the scalar channel of the NJL model plays
the role of a composite inflaton. We find that the Lorentz invariance (LI)
appears at the IR regime of the HL theory and employ the standard inflationary
(slow-roll) paradigm as a probe of physics at very high energy. We compute
inflationary parameters and compare them with recent Planck 2015 data.
Interestingly, we discover that the predictions of the model are in perfect
agreement with the Planck analysis. Our salient feature is that we used
inflation to quantify the IR and UV fixed points of the underlying theory. We
discover that the IR fixed point of HL gravity is compatible with the grand
unified energy scale; whilst the UV fixed point is the Planck energy scale.
