Interactive Systems and Data Science of Graz University of Technology in
Austria on the 5th of September 2017 for the attainment of the degree
'Dr.techn'. The supervisors of this thesis have been Prof. Stefanie Lindstaedt
and Ass.Prof. Elisabeth Lex from Graz University of Technology, and the
external assessor has been Prof. Tobias Ley from Tallinn University.
  In the current enthusiasm around Data Science and Big Data Analytics, it is
important to mention that only theory-guided approaches will truly enable us to
fully understand why an algorithm works and how specific results can be
explained. It was the goal of this dissertation research to follow this path by
demonstrating that a recommender system inspired by human memory theory can
have a true impact in the field.

aluminum grains having a size of a few nm, with a large energy level splitting
of the order of 100 K. The films range from weakly metallic to insulating. In
the insulating case the low temperature relaxation rate is consistent with the
presence of single electron spins in grains having an odd number of electrons.
The relaxation rate temperature dependence follows an activation law having an
energy scale in agreement with the average level splitting. In weakly metallic
films the relaxation rate is smaller and decreases faster with temperature.
Overall our observations are in line with the presence of a Kubo spin in Al
nano-size grains due to quantum size effects.

find that the dip is produced by slow evolution of the 3:1 resonance tidal

estimated mass ratio ($q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1}$) from the period of developing

its superoutburst has many properties similar to those in other low-$q$ WZ
Sge-type DNe: long-lasting stage A superhumps, small superhump amplitudes, long
delay of ordinary superhump appearance, and slow decline rate in the plateau
stage with superhumps. The very small mass ratio and observational
characteristics suggest that this system is one of the best candidates for a
period bouncer -- a binary accounting for the missing population of post-period
minimum cataclysmic variables. Although it is not clearly verified due to the
lack of detection of stage A superhumps, ASASSN-16hg might be a possible
candidate for a period bouncer on the basis of the morphology of its light
curves and the small superhump amplitudes. Many outburst properties of
period-bouncer candidates would originate from the small tidal effects by their
secondary stars.

experiments, so improved definition and control of tolerances can have
significant impact on progress in the field. Here we relate tolerances to the
shape gradient representation that has been useful for shape optimization in
industry, used for example to determine which regions of a car or aerofoil most
affect drag, and we demonstrate how the shape gradient can be computed for
physics properties of toroidal plasmas. The shape gradient gives the local
differential contribution to some scalar figure of merit (shape functional)
caused by normal displacement of the shape. In contrast to derivatives with
respect to quantities parameterizing a shape (e.g. Fourier amplitudes), which
have been used previously for optimizing plasma and coil shapes, the shape
gradient gives spatially local information and so is more easily related to
engineering constraints. We present a method to determine the shape gradient
for any figure of merit using the parameter derivatives that are already
routinely computed for stellarator optimization. Examples of shape gradients
for plasma and electromagnetic coil shapes are given. We also derive and
present examples of an analogous representation of the local sensitivity to
magnetic field errors; this magnetic sensitivity can be rapidly computed from
the shape gradient. The shape gradient and magnetic sensitivity can both be
converted into local tolerances, which inform how accurately the coils should
be built and positioned, where trim coils and structural supports for coils
should be placed, and where magnetic material and current leads can best be
located. Both sensitivity measures provide insight into shape optimization,
enable systematic calculation of tolerances, and connect physics optimization
to engineering criteria that are more easily specified in real space than in
Fourier space.

polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with trait diversity and disease
susceptibility, yet the functional properties of many genetic variants and
their molecular interactions remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that
SNPs in microRNA binding sites may disrupt gene regulation by microRNAs
(miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs that bind to mRNA and downregulate the target
gene. While a number of studies have been conducted to predict the location of
SNPs in miRNA binding sites, to date there has been no comprehensive analysis
of how SNP variants may impact miRNA regulation of genes. Here we investigate
the functional properties of genetic variants and their effects on miRNA
regulation of gene expression in cancer. Our analysis is motivated by the
hypothesis that distinct alleles may cause differential binding (from miRNAs to
mRNAs or from transcription factors to DNA) and change the expression of genes.
We previously identified pathways--systems of genes conferring specific cell
functions--that are dysregulated by miRNAs in cancer, by comparing
miRNA-pathway associations between healthy and tumor tissue. We draw on these
results as a starting point to assess whether SNPs in genes on dysregulated
pathways are responsible for miRNA dysregulation of individual genes in tumors.
Using an integrative analysis that incorporates miRNA expression, mRNA
expression, and SNP genotype data, we identify SNPs that appear to influence
the association between miRNAs and genes, which we term ""regulatory QTLs
(regQTLs)"": loci whose alleles impact the regulation of genes by miRNAs. We
describe the method, apply it to analyze four cancer types (breast, liver,
lung, prostate) using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and provide a
tool to explore the findings.

of interest from advertisers and researchers seeking to monopolize on its
features. Researchers aim to develop strategies for determining how information
is propagated among users within an OSN that is captured by diffusion or
influence models. We consider the influence models for the IM-RO problem, a
novel formulation to the Influence Maximization (IM) problem based on
implementing Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP). In contrast to existing
approaches involving influence spread and the theory of submodular functions,
the SDP method focuses on optimizing clicks and ultimately revenue to
advertisers in OSNs. Existing approaches to influence maximization have been
actively researched over the past decade, with applications to multiple fields,
however, our approach is a more practical variant to the original IM problem.
In this paper, we provide an analysis on the influence models of the IM-RO
problem by conducting experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. We
propose a Bayesian and Machine Learning approach for estimating the parameters
of the influence models for the (Influence Maximization- Revenue Optimization)
IM-RO problem. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model and implement the
well-known Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), Decision Trees classifier (DTC) and
Random Forest classifier (RFC) on three real-world datasets. Compared to
previous approaches to estimating influence model parameters, our strategy has
the great advantage of being directly implementable in standard software
packages such as WinBUGS/OpenBUGS/JAGS and Apache Spark. We demonstrate the
efficiency and usability of our methods in terms of spreading information and
generating revenue for advertisers in the context of OSNs.

realization of Jonscher's time-honored proposal as well as a rationale for
similarities in optical responses between correlated electronic matter and

strongly accelerate the evolution of resistance, reaching a plateau for
sufficiently small periods. Furthermore, this acceleration is stronger in
larger populations. For asymmetric alternations, featuring a different duration
of the phases with and without antimicrobial, we shed light on the existence of
a minimum for the time taken by the population to fully evolve resistance. The
corresponding dramatic acceleration of the evolution of antimicrobial

hydrodynamic level. A basic ingredient of the model is a coupling between
fluctuations of density and velocity gradient via a Herschel-Bulkley-type
constitutive model. Focusing on the limit of low shear rates and high
densities, the model approximates well---but is not limited to---gently sheared
hard sphere colloidal glasses, where solvent effects are negligible. A detailed
analysis of the linearized hydrodynamic equations for fluctuations and the
resulting cubic dispersion relation reveals the existence of a range of
densities and shear rates with growing flow heterogeneity. In this regime,
after an initial transient, the velocity and density fields monotonically reach
a spatially inhomogeneous stationary profile, where regions of high shear rate
and low density coexist with regions of low shear rate and high density. The
steady state is thus maintained by a competition between shear-induced
enhancement of density inhomogeneities and relaxation via overdamped sound
waves. An analysis of the mechanical equilibrium condition provides a criterion
for the existence of steady state solutions. The dynamical evolution of the
system is discussed in detail for various boundary conditions, imposing either
a constant velocity, shear rate, or stress at the walls.

for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such
efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements
in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of
experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts
may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake
locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method
called ""PhaseNet"" that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep
neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with
sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many
applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and
generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals, and noise as
output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in probability provide accurate
arrival times for both P and S waves, and have the potential to increase the
number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available.
This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity
models. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by
analyst-labeled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake
Data Center. The dataset we use contains more than seven million waveform
samples extracted from over thirty years of earthquake recordings. We
demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate

describe different GB kinetic phenomena, this review provides a unifying
concept for a wide range of GB kinetic behavior. Our approach rests on a
disconnection description of GB kinetics. Disconnections are topological line
defects constrained to crystalline interfaces with both step and dislocation
character. These characteristics can be completely specified by GB
bicrystallography and the macroscopic degrees of freedom of GBs. GB thermal
fluctuations, GB migration and the ability of GBs to absorb/emit other defects
from/into the delimiting grains can be modeled via the nucleation, propagation
and reaction of disconnections in the GB. We review the fundamentals of
bicrystallography and its relationship to disconnections and ultimately to the
kinetic behavior of GBs. We then relate disconnection dynamics and GB kinetics
to microstructural evolution. While this review of the GB kinetics literature
is not exhaustive, we review much of the foundational literature and draw
comparisons from a wide swath of the extant experimental, simulation, and
theoretical GB kinetics literature.

major goal of nuclear theory is to predict nuclear structure and nuclear

accurately solve for the properties of atomic nuclei, one faces immense
theoretical and computational challenges. The present study proposes a
feed-forward ANN method for predicting the properties of atomic nuclei like
ground state energy and ground state point proton root-mean-square (rms) radius
based on NCSM results in computationally accessible basis spaces. The designed
ANNs are sufficient to produce results for these two very different observables
in 6Li from the ab initio NCSM results in small basis spaces that satisfy the

light source highlighting a (biologic) sample can be coded before the FTI
acquisition in a procedure called Coded Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI). This turns
HS data reconstruction into a Compressive Sensing (CS) problem regularized by
the sparsity of the HS data. CI-FTI combines the high spectral resolution of
FTI with the advantages of reduced-light-exposure imaging in biology.
  In this paper, we leverage multilevel sampling scheme recently developed in
CS theory to adapt the coding strategy of CI-FTI to the spectral sparsity
structure of HS data in Fluorescence Spectroscopy (FS). This structure is
actually extracted from the spectral signatures of actual fluorescent dyes used
in FS. Accordingly, the optimum illumination coding as well as the theoretical

future constraints on inflationary gravitational waves. As a case-study, we
consider a scale-invariant PMF spectrum with amplitude of
$\approx{1}\,{\mathrm{nG}}$ on $1\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ scales, compatible with
current cosmological bounds. We find a degeneracy in the $B$-mode spectra
between PMFs and inflationary gravitational waves. If PMFs of this amplitude
are not accounted for, future CMB experiments could claim a false detection of
a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\approx 0.007$, close to the predictions of
Starobinsky and $\alpha$-attractor models. The degeneracy can be broken if
$B$-modes are measured also at multipoles $\ell\gtrsim 900$: more precisely
experiments like CMB-S4 or CORE-M5 would be able to discriminate PMFs from
primordial GWs at high statistical significance. Experiments like LiteBIRD or
PIXIE will not be able to break the degeneracy and will need complementary
bounds coming, for example, from measurements of anisotropies in the Faraday

abstract the dialogue state space, taking the decisions at each step using
different parts of the abstracted state. This, combined with an information

expansion of the phase-field crystal model is exploited with the aid of finite
element method calculations. This approach allows for the description of
microscopic features, such as dislocations, while simultaneously being able to
describe length scales that are orders of magnitude larger than the lattice
spacing. Moreover, it allows for the direct description of extended defects by
means of a scalar order parameter. The versatility of this framework is shown
by considering both fcc and bcc lattice symmetries and different rotation axes.
First, the specific case of planar, twist grain boundaries is illustrated. The
details of the method are reported and the consistency of the results with
literature is discussed. Then, the dislocation networks forming at the
interface between a spherical, rotated crystal embedded in an unrotated
crystalline structure, are shown. Although explicitly accounting for
dislocations which lead to an anisotropic shrinkage of the rotated grain, the
extension of the spherical grain boundary is found to decrease linearly over
time in agreement with the classical theory of grain growth and recent
atomistic investigations. It is shown that the results obtained for a system
with bcc symmetry agree very well with existing results, validating the
methodology. Furthermore, fully original results are shown for fcc lattice
symmetry, revealing the generality of the reported observations.

We tackle the domain shift on two levels: 1) the image-level shift, such as

reinforced with a consistency regularization to learn a domain-invariant region

speckles in the stellar PSF, which severely limit the contrast performance of
SPHERE under otherwise optimal observing conditions. In this paper we propose
the Fast & Furious (F&F) phase diversity algorithm as a viable software-only
solution for real-time LWE compensation, which would utilise image sequences
from the SPHERE differential tip-tilt sensor (DTTS). We evaluated the
closed-loop performance of F&F on the MITHIC high-contrast test-bench under a
variety of conditions emulating LWE-affected DTTS images, in order to assess
the expected performance of an on-sky implementation of F&F in SPHERE. The
algorithm was found to be capable of returning such LWE-affected images to
Strehl ratios of greater than 90% within five iterations, for all appropriate
laboratory test cases. These results are highly representative of predictive
simulations, and demonstrate the stability of the algorithm against a wide
range of factors including low image signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), small image
field of view, and amplitude errors. It was also found in simulation that
closed-loop stability can be preserved down to image S/N as low as five while
still improving overall wavefront quality, allowing for reliable operation even
on faint targets. The Fast & Furious algorithm is an extremely promising
solution for real-time compensation of the LWE, which can operate
simultaneously with science observations and may be implemented in SPHERE
without requiring additional hardware. The robustness and relatively large
effective dynamic range of F&F also make it suitable for general wavefront
optimisation applications, including the co-phasing of segmented ELT-class
telescopes.

model of unstable mass transfer from a giant-star donor onto a more compact
accretor in a binary system. Our simulation begins with mass transfer at the
Roche limit separation and traces a phase of runaway decay leading up to the
plunge of the accretor within the envelope of the donor. We characterize the
fluxes of mass and angular momentum through the system and show that the
orbital evolution can be reconstructed from measurements of these quantities.
The morphology of outflow from the binary changes significantly as the binary
orbit tightens. At wide separations, a thin stream of relatively high-entropy
gas trails from the outer Lagrange points. As the orbit tightens, the orbital
motion desynchronizes from the donor's rotation, and low-entropy ejecta trace a
broad fan of largely ballistic trajectories. An order-of-magnitude increase in
mass ejection rate accompanies the plunge of the accretor with the envelope of
the donor. We argue that this transition marks the precursor-to-outburst

is suppressed due to late asymmetric reheating, but remains large enough to be
detected in future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We show that
this framework can lead to distinctive signals in large scale structure and in
the cosmic microwave background. Baryon acoustic oscillations in the mirror
sector prior to recombination lead to a suppression of structure on large
scales, and leave a residual oscillatory pattern in the matter power spectrum.
This pattern depends sensitively on the relative abundances and ionization
energies of both twin hydrogen and helium, and is therefore characteristic of
this class of models. Although both mirror photons and neutrinos constitute
dark radiation in the early universe, their effects on the CMB are distinct.
This is because prior to recombination the twin neutrinos free stream, while
the twin photons are prevented from free streaming by scattering off twin
electrons. In the Mirror Twin Higgs framework the relative contributions of
these two species to the energy density in dark radiation is predicted, leading
to testable effects in the CMB. These highly distinctive cosmological
signatures may allow this class of models to be discovered, and distinguished

X-ray telescopes have allowed us to identify a few dozen candidate tidal
disruption events (TDEs). While in theory the physical processes in TDEs are
expected to be ubiquitous, a few distinct classes of TDEs have been observed.
Some TDEs radiate mainly in NUV/optical while others produce prominent X-rays.
Moreover, relativistic jets have been observed in only a handful of TDEs. This
diversity might be related to the details of the super-Eddington accretion and
emission physics relevant to TDE disks. In this Letter, we utilize novel
three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics
simulations to study the super-Eddington compact disk phase expected in TDEs.
Consistent with previous studies, geometrically thick disks, wide-angle
optically-thick fast outflows and relativistic jets are produced. The outflow
density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, and hence so
does the reprocessing of emission produced from the inner disk. We then use
Monte-Carlo radiative transfer to calculate the reprocessed spectra and find
that that the observed ratio of optical to X-ray fluxes increases with
increasing inclination angle. This naturally leads to a unified model for
different classes of TDEs in which the spectral properties of the TDE depend
mainly on the viewing-angle of the observer with respect to the orientation of
the disk.

coupled to a common photon mode. In the lossy cavity limit, starting with an
initial state of $M$ atoms excited and $N$ atoms in the ground state, we show
that this setup can be configured as a Stern Gerlach experiment. A measurement
of photon emission collapses the wavefunction of atoms onto an RVB state
composed of resonating long-ranged singlets of the form
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\vert 0 1 \rangle - \vert 1 0 \rangle]$. Each emitted
photon reduces the number of singlets by unity, replacing it with a pair of
lone spins or `spinons'. As spinons are formed coherently in pairs, they are
analogous to Cooper pairs in a superconductor. To simulate pair fluctuations,
we propose a protocol in which photons are allowed to escape the cavity
undetected. This leads to a mixed quantum state with a fluctuating number of
spinon pairs -- an inchoate superconductor. Remarkably, in the limit of large
system sizes, this protocol reveals an underlying quantum phase transition.
Upon tuning the initial spin polarization ($M-N$), the emission exhibits a
continuous transition from a dark state to a bright state. This is reflected in
the spinon pair number distribution which can be tuned from sub-poissonian to
super-poissonian regimes. This opens an exciting route to simulate RVB states
and superconductivity.

Comparisons of these cold dust features with ancillary data reveal an imperfect
spatial correlation with the ionized gas and warm dust wind components. We find
that typically $\sim$10-20\% of the total dust mass in these galaxies resides
outside of their stellar disks, but this fraction reaches $\sim$60\% in the
case of NGC 1569. This galaxy also has the largest metallicity (O/H) deficit in

dust. We detect no statistically significant trends with star formation
properties of the host galaxies, as might be expected if the dust were lifted
above the disk by energy inputs from on-going star formation activity. Although
a case for dust entrained in a galactic wind is seen in NGC 1569, in all cases,

of impact rates on Mars. We use the N-body integrator RMVS/Swifter to propagate

comets and asteroids to the simulations as massless test particles, based on
their current orbital elements, yielding Mars impact rates of
$4.34\times10^{-3}$ comets/Myr and 3.3 asteroids/Myr. We estimate the global

recently reported a strong 21-cm absorption signal relative to the cosmic
microwave background at $z \sim 18$. While its anomalous amplitude may indicate
new physics, in this work we focus on the timing of the signal, as it alone
provides an important constraint on galaxy formation models. Whereas rest-frame
ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) over a broad range of redshifts are
well fit by simple models in which galaxy star formation histories track the
assembly of dark matter halos, we find that these same models, with reasonable
assumptions about X-ray production in star-forming galaxies, cannot generate a
narrow absorption trough at $z \sim 18$. If verified, the EDGES signal
therefore requires the fundamental inputs of galaxy formation models to evolve
rapidly at $z \gtrsim 10$. Unless extremely faint sources residing in halos
below the atomic cooling threshold are responsible for the EDGES signal, star
formation in $\sim 10^8$-$10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$ halos must be more efficient
than expected, implying that the faint-end of the UVLF at $M_{\mathrm{UV}}
\lesssim -12$ must steepen at the highest redshifts. This steepening provides a
concrete test for future galaxy surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope and
ongoing efforts in lensed fields, and is required regardless of whether the
amplitude of the EDGES signal is due to new cooling channels or a strong radio
background in the early Universe. However, the radio background solution
requires that galaxies at $z > 15$ emit 1-2 GHz photons with an efficiency
$\sim 10^3$ times greater than local star-forming galaxies, posing a challenge
for models of low-frequency photon production in the early Universe.

profile that is close to $\rho \sim r^{-2}$. We prove analytically this density
profile is the result of the scale-free nature of the gravitational collapse.
Therefore, it should emerge in many different situations as long as gravity is
dominating the evolution for a period that is comparable or longer than the
free-fall time, and this does not necessarily imply an isothermal model, as
many have previously believed.
  To describe the collapse process, we construct a model called the
turbulence-regulated gravitational collapse model, where turbulence is
sustained by accretion and dissipates in roughly a crossing time. We
demonstrate that a $\rho \sim r^{-2}$ profile emerges due to the scale-free
nature the system. In this particular case, the rate of gravitational collapse
is regulated by the rate at which turbulence dissipates the kinetic energy such
that the infall speed can be $20 - 50 \%$ of the free-fall speed(which also
depends on the interpretation of the crossing time based on simulations of
driven turbulence). These predictions are consistent with existing
observations, which suggests that these clumps are in the stage of
turbulence-regulated gravitational collapse. Our analysis provides a unified
description of gravitational collapse in different environments.

in the presence of radiative transfer, in high-resolution zoom-in simulations
in a cosmological framework, down to the formation of the photosphere and the
central object. Radiative transfer has been implemented in the flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) approximation. Adiabatic models were run for comparison. We
find that (a) the FLD flow forms an irregular central structure and does not
exhibit fragmentation, contrary to adiabatic flow which forms a thick disk,
driving a pair of spiral shocks, subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instability
forming fragments; (b) the growing central core in the FLD flow quickly reaches
~10 Mo and a highly variable luminosity of 10^{38}-10^{39} erg/s, comparable to
the Eddington luminosity. It experiences massive recurrent outflows driven by
radiation force and thermal pressure gradients, which mix with the accretion
flow and transfer the angular momentum outwards; and (c) the interplay between
these processes and a massive accretion, results in photosphere at ~10 AU. We
conclude that in the FLD model (1) the central object exhibits dynamically
insignificant rotation and slower than adiabatic temperature rise with density;
(2) does not experience fragmentation leading to star formation, thus promoting
the fast track formation of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed; (3)
inclusion of radiation force leads to outflows, resulting in the mass
accumulation within the central 10^{-3} pc, which is ~100 times larger than

reveals complex early stages of formation and growth of the central structure

diagonalization of a block matrix whose blocks are matrix representations of

errors, we present a rigorous analysis of the accuracy and noise sensitivity of
spectral group synchronization algorithms over any compact group, up to the

Below the phase transition, spectral group synchronization succeeds in
recovering the unknown group elements, but its performance deteriorates with

enforces an order of network transfers which improves the iteration time using

deterministic times. In the regime where the increments of the resampling times
diverge, which is referred to as the cooling regime, a weak law of large

quenched large deviation principle hold as well. In the cooling regime, the
random walk can be represented as a sum of independent variables, distributed
as the increments of a random walk in a static random environment over
increasing periods of time. Our proofs require suitable multi-layer
decompositions of sums of random variables controlled by moments bounds and
concentration estimates. Along the way we derive two results of independent
interest, namely, a concentration inequality for the cumulants of the
displacement in the static random environment and an ergodic theorem that deals
with limits of sums of triangular arrays representing the structure of the
cooling regime. We close by discussing our present understanding of
homogenisation effects as a function of the speed of divergence of the

collected on a uniform grid of predetermined statepoints. This approach, also

by adaptively choosing the next most informative statepoint(s) every round.
This is done by interpolating the sampled statepoints' phases by Gaussian
Process regression. An acquisition function quantifies the informativeness of
possible next statepoints, maximizing the information content in each

state-of-the-art batch sampling techniques to better utilize parallel computing

provides super compaction of an arbitrary 3D shape with non-negligible surface
thickness called ""algorithmic stacking"". Our approach computationally finds a
way of cutting the thick surface of the shape into a strip. This strip forms a
Hamiltonian cycle that covers the entire surface and can realize transformation
between two target shapes: from a super compact stacked shape to the input 3D
shape. Depending on the surface thickness, the stacked structure takes merely
0.001% to 6% of the original volume. This super compacted structure not only
can be manufactured in a workspace that is significantly smaller than the
provided 3D shape, but also makes packing and transportation easier for a
deployable application. We further demonstrate that, the proposed stackable
structure also provides high pluripotency and can transform into multiple 3D
target shapes if these 3D shapes can be dissected in specific ways and form a
common stacked structure. In contrast to many designs of origami structure that
usually target at a particular shape, our results provide a universal platform

timescale, $t_Q$, corresponding to the time required after a galaxy is accreted
by a cluster for it to fully cease star formation. Cluster members are selected
by a photometric-redshift criterion, and categorized as star-forming,
quiescent, or intermediate according to their dust-corrected rest-frame colors
and magnitudes. We employ a ""delayed-then-rapid"" quenching model that relates a
simulated cluster mass accretion rate to the observed numbers of each type of
galaxy in the cluster to constrain $t_Q$. For galaxies of mass $M_* \gtrsim
10^{10.5}~ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, we find a quenching timescale of $t_Q=$ 1.24 Gyr
in the $z\sim1.5$ cluster sample, and $t_Q=$ 1.50 Gyr at $z\sim1$. Using values
drawn from the literature, we compare the redshift evolution of $t_Q$ to
timescales predicted for different physical quenching mechanisms. We find $t_Q$
to depend on host halo mass such that quenching occurs over faster timescales
in clusters relative to groups, suggesting that properties of the host halo are
responsible for quenching high-mass galaxies. Between $z=0$ and $z=1.5$, we
find that $t_Q$ evolves faster than the molecular gas depletion timescale and
slower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent with the evolution of
the dynamical time. This suggests that environmental quenching in these
galaxies is driven by the motion of satellites relative to the cluster
environment, although due to uncertainties in the atomic gas budget at high
redshift, we cannot rule out quenching due to simple gas depletion.

assigns it to one of the servers according to the Join-the-Shortest Queue (JSQ)
policy. Eschenfeldt and Gamarnik (2015) established that in the Halfin-Whitt
regime where $(N-\lambda(N))/\sqrt{N}\to\beta>0$ as $N\to\infty$, appropriately
scaled occupancy measure of the system under the JSQ policy converges weakly on
any finite time interval to a certain diffusion process as $N\to\infty$.
Recently, it was further established by Braverman (2018) that the stationary
occupancy measure of the system converges weakly to the steady state of the
diffusion process as $N\to\infty$.
  In this paper we perform a detailed analysis of the steady state of the above
diffusion process. Specifically, we establish precise tail-asymptotics of the
stationary distribution and scaling of extrema of the process on large
time-interval. Our results imply that the asymptotic steady-state scaled number
of servers with queue length two or larger exhibits an Exponential tail,
whereas that for the number of idle servers turns out to be Gaussian. From the
methodological point of view, the diffusion process under consideration goes
beyond the state-of-the-art techniques in the study of the steady-state of
diffusion processes. Lack of any closed form expression for the steady state
and intricate interdependency of the process dynamics on its local times make
the analysis significantly challenging. We develop a technique involving the
theory of regenerative processes that provides a tractable form for the
stationary measure, and in conjunction with several sharp hitting time
estimates, acts as a key vehicle in establishing the results.

part in 1e14, and similar systematic errors.It improves by 10 times over the
best ground tests with rotating torsion balances despite 70 times less
sensitivity to differential accelerations, thanks to the much stronger driving
signal in orbit. The test is limited by thermal noise from internal damping in
the gold wires used for electrical grounding. This noise was shown to decrease
when the s/c was set to rotate faster than planned. The result will improve by
the end of the mission, as thermal noise decreases with more data. Not so
systematic errors. We investigate major non-gravitational effects and find that
the Pt-Pt sensor does not allow their separation from the signal. The early
test reports an upper limit of systematic errors in the Pt-Ti sensor which are
not detected in the Pt-Pt one, hence would not be distinguished from a
violation. Once all the integration time is used to reduce random noise there
will be no time left to check systematics. MICROSCOPE demonstrates the huge
potential of space for WEP tests of very high precision and indicates how to
reach it. To realize the potential, a new experiment needs the spacecraft to be

has been observed in the past decades. Current methods achieve recognition and
tracking with invariance to fundamental modes of variation such as
illumination, 3D pose, expressions. Notwithstanding, a much less standing mode
of variation is motion deblurring, which however presents substantial
challenges in face analysis. Recent approaches either make oversimplifying
assumptions, e.g. in cases of joint optimization with other tasks, or fail to
preserve the highly structured shape/identity information. Therefore, we
propose a data-driven method that encourages identity preservation. The
proposed model includes two parallel streams (sub-networks): the first deblurs
the image, the second implicitly extracts and projects the identity of both the
sharp and the blurred image in similar subspaces. We devise a method for
creating realistic motion blur by averaging a variable number of frames to
train our model. The averaged images originate from a 2MF2 dataset with 10
million facial frames, which we introduce for the task. Considering deblurring
as an intermediate step, we utilize the deblurred outputs to conduct a thorough
experimentation on high-level face analysis tasks, i.e. landmark localization
and face verification. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority
of our method.

Depending on the application and the system requirements, the CSD module can be
loaded at any time with variable module size (corresponding to different
version of the CSD) and allocated in different possible reconfigurable regions.
Such implementation entails many problems related to communication, relocation
and reconfigurable region management. We will demonstrate how we have made this
implementation successful through the use of an appropriate design method. This
method was proposed to support the management of variable-size hardware tasks
on DPR FPGAs based adaptive systems. It permits to efficiently handle the
reconfigurable area and to relocate the reconfigurable modules in different
possible regions. The implementation results for the considered application
show an important optimization in terms of configuration time (until 66 %) and
memory storage (until 87 %) and an efficient hardware resources utilization

changing the incident beam energies from 0.3 to 0.6 GeV/nucleon in the

chemically evolved among other starless cores in the Orion A cloud. By
combining ALMA 12-m and ACA data, we recover extended emission with a
resolution of $\sim5""$ corresponding to 0.01 pc and identify 6 condensations
with a mass range of $0.1-0.4$ $M_\odot$ and a radius of $\lesssim0.01$ pc.
These condensations are gravitationally bound following a virial analysis and
are embedded in the filament including the elongated core with a mass of
$\sim29$ $M_\odot$ and a radial density profile of $r^{-1.6}$ derived by {\it
Herschel}. The separation of these condensations is $\sim0.035$ pc, consistent
with the thermal jeans length at a density of $4.4\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. This
density is similar to the central part of the core. We also find a tendency
that the N$_2$H$^+$ molecule seems to deplete at the dust peak condensation.
This condensation may be beginning to collapse because the linewidth becomes
broader. Therefore, the fragmentation still occurs in the prestellar core by
thermal Jeans instability and multiple stars are formed within the TUKH122
prestellar core. The CH$_3$OH emission shows a large shell-like distribution
and surrounds these condensations, suggesting that the CH$_3$OH molecule formed

photoevaporation caused by cosmic-ray induced UV radiation.

texture requires complete melting, their maximum liquidus temperature 1928 K

crystallization experiments show that the SO texture can be created only by
brief reheating episodes during crystallization giving partial dissolution of
olivine. The ejecta plume formed in a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulation (Asphaug et al., 2011) served as the basis for 3D modeling with the
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH4.3. Tracer particles that move with
the fluid cells are used to measure the in situ cooling rates. Their cooling
rates are ~10,000K/hr briefly at peak temperature and, in the densest regions
of the plume, ~100 K/hr for 1400-1600 K. A small fraction of cells is seen to
be heating at any one time, with heating spikes explained by compression of
parcels of gas in a heterogeneous patchy plume. These temperature fluctuations

popular formulation of such problems is as Bayesian inverse problems, where a
prior distribution is used to regularize inference on a high-dimensional latent

non-Gaussian, for example piecewise-constant or heavy-tailed, and/or
hierarchical, in the sense of involving a further set of low-dimensional

efficient exploration of the posterior distribution of latent states and

about the Lie algebra of the maximal compact subgroup of
$G=\operatorname{SL}(n)$ . There is a polyhedral cone (the ""eigencone"")
determining the possible answers to the problem. These eigencones can be
defined for arbitrary semisimple groups $G$, and also control the (suitably
stabilized) problem of existence of non-zero invariants in tensor products of
irreducible representations of $G$.
  We give a description of the extremal rays of the eigencones for arbitrary
semisimple groups $G$ by first observing that extremal rays lie on regular
facets, and then classifying extremal rays on an arbitrary regular face.
Explicit formulas are given for some extremal rays, which have an explicit
geometric meaning as cycle classes of interesting loci, on an arbitrary regular
face, and the remaining extremal rays on that face are understood by a
geometric process we introduce, and explicate numerically, called induction
from Levi subgroups. Several numerical examples are given. The main results,

kernels described by graphs. One fundamental problem in GSP is sampling---from
which subset of graph nodes to collect samples in order to reconstruct a
bandlimited graph signal in high fidelity. In this paper, we seek a sampling
strategy that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstructed
bandlimited graph signals assuming an independent and identically distributed
(iid) noise model---leading naturally to the A-optimal design criterion. To
avoid matrix inversion, we first prove that the inverse of the information
matrix in the A-optimal criterion is equivalent to a Neumann matrix series. We
then transform the truncated Neumann series based sampling problem into an
equivalent expression that replaces eigenvectors of the Laplacian operator with
a sub-matrix of an ideal low-pass graph filter. Finally, we approximate the
ideal filter using a Chebyshev matrix polynomial. We design a greedy algorithm
to iteratively minimize the simplified objective. For signal reconstruction, we
propose an accompanied signal reconstruction strategy that reuses the
approximated filter sub-matrix and is provably more robust than conventional
least square recovery. Simulation results show that our sampling strategy
outperforms two previous strategies in MSE performance at comparable
complexity.

high network density was observed in the intraoperative segment and partially
in postoperative one, representing the existence of cohesive clusters of

change over time and the loss factor. The increasing of loss factor only makes
the damping form from the oscillating decay to over-damping decay. However,
when the nonlinear interaction is introduced, even interactions in the two end

diminished. Simultaneously the increasing of loss factor will also aggravate
the loss. In this process the interaction in the middle well plays no role.

all disappear with time. In addition, when we extend the triple-well system to
a general (2n + 1)-well, the loss is reduced greatly by the factor 1=2n in the

flow characteristics such as vortical structures and turbulent shear stresses.
Studying the flow characteristics through these valves during their normal

maximum flow velocities increased with dysfunction from 2.05 to 4.49 ms-1 which

may be due to valve stenosis and insufficiency. In the current study, the
effect of these geometrical changes on the mean flow and velocity fluctuations
downstream of the valve and aortic sinuses were investigated. The study focused
on the fully-open leaflet position where blood velocities are close to their

Doppler anemometry (LDA) measurements. Results showed that as the stenosis and
insufficiency increased there were more flow separation and increased local
mean velocity downstream of the leaflets. In addition, the detected elevated
velocity fluctuations were associated with higher Reynolds shear stresses

by extreme events having the form of rare transitions several standard
deviations away from the mean. For such systems, order-reduction methods
through projection of the governing equations have limited applicability due to
the large intrinsic dimensionality of the underlying attractor but also the
complexity of the transient events. An alternative approach is data-driven
techniques that aim to quantify the dynamics of specific modes utilizing
data-streams. Several of these approaches have improved performance by
expanding the state representation using delayed coordinates. However, such
strategies are limited in regions of the phase space where there is a small
amount of data available, as is the case for extreme events. In this work, we
develop a blended framework that integrates an imperfect model, obtained from
projecting equations into a subspace that still contains crucial dynamical
information, with data-streams through a recurrent neural network (RNN)
architecture. In particular, we employ the long-short-term memory (LSTM), to
model portions of the dynamics which cannot be accounted by the equations. The
RNN is trained by analyzing the mismatch between the imperfect model and the
data-streams, projected in the reduced-order space. In this way, the
data-driven model improves the imperfect model in regions where data is
available, while for locations where data is sparse the imperfect model still
provides a baseline for the prediction of the system dynamics. We assess the
developed framework on two challenging prototype systems exhibiting extreme
events and show that the blended approach has improved performance compared
with methods that use either data streams or the imperfect model alone. The
improvement is more significant in regions associated with extreme events,
where data is sparse.

conventional textile methods utilised to process flax. These techniques impart
disadvantageous features onto fibres at both micro, and mesolevel, which
degrade the mechanical performances of flax fibre reinforced composites, FFRC.
Undulation of fibre is one of those detrimental features that occur during
traditional fibre extraction and fabric manufacturing routes. The undulation or
waviness causes micro compressive defects or kink bands in elementary flax
fibres, which significantly undermines the performance of FFRC. Manufacturing
flax fabric with minimal undulation could diminish the micro compressive
defects up to a substantial extent. In this research, nonwoven flax tapes of
highly aligned flax fibres, blended with a small proportion of PLA, Polylactic
Acid have been manufactured deploying a novel technique. Composites reinforced

semantic space constrained on relevant topics, therefore it preserves more
precise and subtle information for specific queries. Considering the candidate
ranking, the heterogeneous information network structure, while being largely
ignored in the previous studies of expert finding, provides additional
information. Specifically, different types of interactions among objects play
different roles. We propose a ranking algorithm to estimate the authority of
objects in the network, treating each strongly-typed edge type individually. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we apply the proposed
method to a large-scale bibliographical dataset with over two million entries
and one million researcher candidates. The experiment results show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing methods for both general and specific
queries.

thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) such as air conditioners,
refrigerators, and water heaters. Because the short-term timing of operation of
such systems is inconsequential as long as their long-run average power
consumption is maintained, they are increasingly used in demand response (DR)
programs to balance supply and demand on the power grid. Here, we present an
\textit{ab initio} phase model for general TCLs, and use the concept to develop
a continuous oscillator model of a TCL and compute its phase response to
changes in temperature and applied power. This yields a simple control system
model that can be used to evaluate control policies for modulating the power
consumption of aggregated loads with parameter heterogeneity and stochastic
drift. We demonstrate this concept by comparing simulations of ensembles of
heterogeneous loads using the continuous state model and an established hybrid
state model. The developed phase model approach is a novel means of evaluating
DR provision using TCLs, and is instrumental in estimating the capacity of
ancillary services or DR on different time scales. We further propose a novel
phase response based open-loop control policy that effectively modulates the
aggregate power of a heterogeneous TCL population while maintaining load
diversity and minimizing power overshoots. This is demonstrated by low-error
tracking of a regulation signal by filtering it into frequency bands and using
TCL sub-ensembles with duty cycles in corresponding ranges. Control policies
that can maintain a uniform distribution of power consumption by aggregated
heterogeneous loads will enable distribution system management (DSM) approaches
that maintain stability as well as power quality, and further allow more
integration of renewable energy sources.

added to the model, which limits statistical accuracy. To address this issue,
we describe a simple low-precision stochastic gradient descent variant called
HALP. HALP converges at the same theoretical rate as full-precision algorithms
despite the noise introduced by using low precision throughout execution. The
key idea is to use SVRG to reduce gradient variance, and to combine this with a
novel technique called bit centering to reduce quantization error. We show that
on the CPU, HALP can run up to $4 \times$ faster than full-precision SVRG and
can match its convergence trajectory. We implemented HALP in TensorQuant, and

interference fringes in a whispering-gallery resonator, where the coherent
phonons for free evolution can be achieved by stimulated Brillouin scattering.
These two different fringes appear, respectively, in the regimes of rotating
wave approximation (RWA) and anti-RWA. Our work shows particularly that the
anti-RWA Ramsey interference takes some quantum properties of squeezing, which
enhances the strength and visibility of the fringes and shows robustness
against the system's decay. In application, our proposal, feasible with current
laboratory techniques, provides a practical idea for building better quantum
interferometers.

key role in extracellular matrix and connective tissue mechanics. Despite its
prevalence and physical importance in biology, the mechanical properties of
molecular collagen are far from established. The flexibility of its triple
helix is unresolved, with descriptions from different experimental techniques
ranging from flexible to semirigid. Furthermore, it is unknown how collagen
type (homo- vs. heterotrimeric) and source (tissue-derived vs. recombinant)
influence flexibility. Using SmarTrace, a chain tracing algorithm we devised,
we performed statistical analysis of collagen conformations collected with
atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the protein's mechanical properties.
Our results show that types I, II and III collagens - the key fibrillar
varieties - exhibit molecular flexibilities that are very similar. However,
collagen conformations are strongly modulated by salt, transitioning from
compact to extended as KCl concentration increases, in both neutral and acidic
pH. While analysis with a standard worm-like chain model suggests that the
persistence length of collagen can attain almost any value within the
literature range, closer inspection reveals that this modulation of collagen's
conformational behavior is not due to changes in flexibility, but rather arises
from the induction of curvature (either intrinsic or induced by interactions
with the mica surface). By modifying standard polymer theory to include innate
curvature, we show that collagen behaves as an equilibrated curved worm-like
chain (cWLC) in two dimensions. Analysis within the cWLC model shows that
collagen's curvature depends strongly on pH and salt, while its persistence
length does not. Thus, we find that triple-helical collagen is well described
as semiflexible, irrespective of source, type, pH and salt environment.

rate of slotted Aloha networks. By extending the analysis to incorporate the

Specifically, two representative SIC receivers are considered, i.e, ordered SIC
where packets are decoded in a descending order of their received power, and
unordered SIC where packets are decoded in a random order. The maximum sum rate
and the corresponding optimal parameter setting including the transmission
probability and the information encoding rate in both cases are obtained as
functions of the mean received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The comparison to
the capture model shows that the gains are significant only with the ordered
SIC at moderate values of the mean received SNR $\rho$. With a large $\rho$,
the rate gap diminishes, and they all have the same high-SNR slope of $e^{-1}$,
which is far below that of the ergodic sum capacity of fading channels. The
effect of multipacket reception (MPR) on the sum rate performance is also
studied by comparing the MPR receivers including SIC and the capture model to

computer vision. It is even more painstaking when the generation is conditioned

understanding, corresponding, and transforming appearance and semantic
information across the views is not trivial. In this paper, we attempt to solve
the novel problem of cross-view image synthesis, aerial to street-view and vice
versa, using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). Two new
architectures called Crossview Fork (X-Fork) and Crossview Sequential (X-Seq)
are proposed to generate scenes with resolutions of 64x64 and 256x256 pixels.
X-Fork architecture has a single discriminator and a single generator. The
generator hallucinates both the image and its semantic segmentation in the
target view. X-Seq architecture utilizes two cGANs. The first one generates the
target image which is subsequently fed to the second cGAN for generating its
corresponding semantic segmentation map. The feedback from the second cGAN
helps the first cGAN generate sharper images. Both of our proposed
architectures learn to generate natural images as well as their semantic
segmentation maps. The proposed methods show that they are able to capture and
maintain the true semantics of objects in source and target views better than
the traditional image-to-image translation method which considers only the
visual appearance of the scene. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations support the effectiveness of our frameworks, compared to two state
of the art methods, for natural scene generation across drastically different

state-of-the-art radiative-MHD simulations of spicules, we investigate in
detail a type-II spicule associated with a fast (300 km s$^{-1}$) network jet
recorded in the campaign observations. Our analysis suggests that spicular
material exists suspended high in the atmosphere but in lower temperatures
(seen in Ly$\alpha$) until it is heated and becomes visible in TR temperatures
as a network jet. The heating begins lower in the spicule and propagates
upwards as a rapidly propagating thermal front. The front is then observed as
fast, plane-of-the-sky motion typical of a network jet, but contained inside

polar-orbiting satellite observations, which can be usually acquired only once

in satellite-derived PM2.5 due to the cloud contamination. In this paper, the
hourly geostationary satellite (i.e., Himawari-8) observations were adopted for
the real-time monitoring of PM2.5 in a deep learning architecture. On this
basis, the satellite-derived PM2.5 in conjunction with ground PM2.5

to compare observed and predicted properties of single Galactic O stars to
identify and constrain uncertain physical parameters and processes in stellar
evolution and atmosphere models. We used a sample of 53 objects with spectral
types from O3 to O9.7. For 30 of these, we determined the main photospheric and
wind parameters, using optical spectroscopy and applying the FASTWIND code. For
the remaining objects, literature data, obtained by means of the CMFGEN code,
were used instead. The properties of our sample were compared to published
predictions based on two grids evolution models that include rotationally
induced mixing. Within each luminosity class, we find a close correlation of N
surface abundance and luminosity, and a stronger N enrichment in more massive
and evolved O stars. Additionally, a correlation of the surface nitrogen and
helium abundances is observed. The large number of nitrogen-enriched stars
above ~30 solar masses argues for rotationally induced mixing as the most
likely explanation. However, none of the considered models can match the
observed trends correctly, especially in the high mass regime. We confirm mass
discrepancy for objects in the low mass O-star regime. We conclude that the
rotationally induced mixing of helium to the stellar surface is too strong in
some of the models. We also suggest that present inadequacies of the models to
represent the N enrichment in more massive stars with relatively slow rotation
might be related to problematic efficiencies of rotational mixing. We are left
with a picture in which invoking binarity and magnetic fields is required to
achieve a more complete agreement of the observed surface properties of a
population of massive main- sequence stars with corresponding evolutionary
models.

to magnetic field that is generated by accreting matter flow. There is a point
of view that electromagnetic fields around rotating black holes are brought to
the hole by accretion. In this situation the prograde accreting disks produce
weaker large-scale black hole threading magnetic fields, implying weaker jets
that in retrograde regimes. The basic goal of this paper is to find the best
candidates for retrograde accreting systems in observed active galactic nuclei.
We show that active galactic nuclei with low Eddington ratio are really the
best candidates for retrograde systems. This conclusion is obtained for
kinetically dominated FRII radio galaxies, flat spectrum radio loud narrow line
Seyfert I galaxies and a number of nearby galaxies. Our conclusion is that the
best candidates for retrograde systems are the noticeable population of active
galactic nuclei in the Universe. This result corresponds to the conclusion that
in the merging process the interaction of merging black holes with a retrograde
circumbinary disk is considerably more effective for shrinking the binary

generally they are unaffordable and do not make use of existing smartphone
cameras, which are generally of decent quality. Due to this, while there are
several means to consume 3D or VR content, there is currently lack of means to
capture 3D content, resulting in very few 3D videos being publicly available.
Some mobile applications such as Camerada enable 3D or VR content capture by
combining the output of two existing smartphones, but users would have to hold
the cameras in their hand, making it difficult to align properly. In this paper
we present the design of a system to enable 3D content capture using one or
more smartphones, taking care of alignment issues so as to get optimal
alignment of the smartphone cameras. We aim to keep the distance between the
cameras constant and equal to the inter-pupillary distance of about 6.5 cm. Our
solution is applicable for one, two and three smartphones. We have a mobile app
to generate a template given the dimensions of the smartphones, camera
positions and other specifications. The template can be printed by the user and
cut out on 2D cardboard, similar to Google cardboard. Alternatively, it can be
printed using a 3D printer. During video capture, with the smartphones aligned
using our printed template, we capture videos which are then combined to get
the optimal 3D content. We present the details of a small proof of concept
implementation. Our solution would make it easier for people to use existing
smartphones to generate 3D content.

inherent features of a flexible TDD design to mitigate both the beamformed

design is based on the key observation that the transmission path chosen for

this approach, the input of the network is the point spread function in the
spatial domain or the coherent transfer function in the Fourier domain. The
object is treated as 2D learnable weights of a convolution or a multiplication
layer. The output of the network is modeled as the loss function we aim to
minimize. The batch size of the network corresponds to the number of captured
low-resolution images in one forward / backward pass. We use a popular
open-source machine learning library, TensorFlow, for setting up the network
and conducting the optimization process. We analyze the performance of
different learning rates, different solvers, and different batch sizes. It is
shown that a large batch size with the Adam optimizer achieves the best
performance in general. To accelerate the phase retrieval process, we also
discuss a strategy to implement Fourier-magnitude projection using a
multiplication neural network model. Since convolution and multiplication are
the two most-common operations in imaging modeling, the reported approach may
provide a new perspective to examine many coherent and incoherent systems. As a

tactile properties help us decide which actions we should choose and how to
perform them. E.g., we can drive slower if we see that we have bad traction or
grasp tighter if an item looks slippery. We believe that this ability also
helps robots to enhance their understanding of the environment, and thus
enables them to tailor their actions to the situation at hand. We therefore
propose a model to estimate the degree of tactile properties from visual
perception alone (e.g., the level of slipperiness or roughness). Our method
extends a encoder-decoder network, in which the latent variables are visual and
tactile features. In contrast to previous works, our method does not require
manual labeling, but only RGB images and the corresponding tactile sensor data.
All our data is collected with a webcam and uSkin tactile sensor mounted on the

Recurrence and transience of a vertex are an important notion in the study of

abstracted API calls. Then, aiming to apply the same technique in a dynamic
analysis setting, we modify CHIMP, a platform recently proposed to crowdsource
human inputs for app testing, in order to extract API calls' sequences from the
traces produced while executing the app on a CHIMP virtual device. We call this
system AuntieDroid and instantiate it by using both automated (Monkey) and
user-generated inputs. We find that combining both static and dynamic analysis
yields the best performance, with F-measure reaching 0.92. We also show that
static analysis is at least as effective as dynamic analysis, depending on how
apps are stimulated during execution, and, finally, investigate the reasons for
inconsistent misclassifications across methods.

Travelers represent 72.7 percent of all mobile scholars, but migrants have
higher scientific impact. We apply this classification at the country level,
expanding the classification to incorporate the directionality of scientists'

bands for Gaussian white noise models, linear inverse problems, and (possibly
non-Gaussian) nonparametric regression models. In particular, we show that
Bayesian credible bands for those nonparametric models have coverage errors
decaying polynomially fast in the sample size, implying advantages of Bayesian

adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However,
because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in
which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many
researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving
algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized
bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes
uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal
creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the
standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles
to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The
stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but
that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and
outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only
among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how
interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution
can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published
before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of
artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand
accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of
scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also
present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of
evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a
universal property of all complex evolving systems.

simulations on nucleation in various attraction but fixed repulsion conditions
of the interaction potential have led us to motivate, then establish, a thermal
evolution law for interfacial tension. Taking into account a scale dependance
in the vicinity of absolute zero in temperature, this law is of stretched
Arrhenius type. It works with the Zeldovich formula, notably for the
determination of adjusting parameters. A remarkably accurate adjusting of this
law to the numerical simulations has been obtained and led us to exhibit
melting crystal volume as a measure of potential attractivity. It should allow
accurate forecasts of instantaneous nucleation rate and average nucleation
duration in physical or numerical super-cooled monoatomic liquids.

that the vibration levels are attenuated by up to two orders of magnitude at

the Bloch-Floquet theory, the paper first investigates the linearized response
of chains composed of tensegrity units and lumped masses, which undergo small
oscillations around an initial equilibrium state. The stiffness of the units in
such a state varies with an internal self-stress induced by prestretching the
cables forming the tensegrity units, and the global prestress induced by the
application of compression forces to the terminal bases. The given results show
that frequency band gaps of monoatomic and biatomic chains can be effectively
altered by the fine tuning of local and global prestress parameters, while
keeping material properties unchanged. Numerical results on the wave dynamics
of chains under moderately large displacements confirm the presence of
frequency band gaps of the examined systems in the elastically hardening

response of the cell to changes in the environment. Although the structure of
GRNs has been the subject of many studies, their large scale structure in the
light of feedbacks from the metabolic network (MN) has received relatively
little attention. Here we study the causal structure of the GRNs, namely the
chain of influence of one component on the other, taking into account feedback
from the MN. First we consider the GRNs of E. coli and B. subtilis without
feedback from MN and illustrate their causal structure. Next we augment the
GRNs with feedback from their respective MNs by including (a) links from genes
coding for enzymes to metabolites produced or consumed in reactions catalyzed
by those enzymes and (b) links from metabolites to genes coding for
transcription factors whose transcriptional activity the metabolites alter by
binding to them. We find that the inclusion of feedback from MN into GRN
significantly affects its causal structure, in particular the number of levels
and relative positions of nodes in the hierarchy, and the number and size of
the strongly connected components (SCCs). We then study the functional
significance of the SCCs. For this we identify condition specific feedbacks
from the MN into the GRN by retaining only those enzymes that are essential for
growth in specific environmental conditions simulated via the technique of flux
balance analysis (FBA). We find that the SCCs of the GRN augmented by these
feedbacks can be ascribed specific functional roles in the organism. Our
algorithmic approach thus reveals relatively autonomous subsystems with
specific functionality, or regulatory modules in the organism. This automated
approach could be useful in identifying biologically relevant modules in other
organisms for which network data is available, but whose biology is less well
studied.

counterparties and thus breaks the usual XVA pricing assumption of counterparty
independence. Consider a typical case of a bank hedging a client trade via a
CCP. On client default the hedge (effects) will be removed (rebalanced). On the
other hand, if the hedge counterparty defaults the hedge will be replaced. Thus
if the hedge required initial margin then the default probability driving MVA
is from the client not from the hedge counterparty. This is the opposite of
usual assumptions where counterparty XVAs are computed independent of each
other. Replacement of the hedge counterparty means multiple CVA costs on the
hedge side need inclusion. Since hedge trades are generally at riskless mid (or
worse) these costs are paid on the client side, and must be calculated before
the replacement hedge counterparties are known. We call these counterparties
anonymous counterparties. The effects on CVA and MVA will generally be
exclusive because MVA largely removes CVA, and CVA is hardly relevant for CCPs.
Effects on KVA and FVA will resemble those on MVA. We provide a theoretical
framework, including anonymous counterparties, and numerical examples. Pricing
XVA by considering counterparties in isolation is inadequate and behaviour must
be taken into account.

computation time. Secondly, our MPC explicitly incorporates the time dependent
non-linear actuator dynamics that captures the transient response of the
vehicle for a given commanded velocity. This added complexity improves the
predictive component of MPC resulting in improved margin of inter-vehicle
distance during maneuvers like overtaking, lane-change, etc. Although, past
works have also incorporated actuator dynamics within MPC, there has been very
few attempts towards coupling actuator dynamics to collision avoidance
constraints through the non-holonomic motion model of the vehicle and analyzing
the resulting behavior. We use a high fidelity simulator to benchmark our
actuator dynamics augmented MPC with other related approaches in terms of
metrics like inter-vehicle distance, trajectory smoothness, and velocity
overshoot.

Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs, considering bilateral actuation and sensing, i.e., at the
two boundaries of a 1-D spatial domain. First, we solve the nonlinear
trajectory generation problem for this type of PDEs, providing the necessary
feedforward actions at both boundaries. Second, in order to guarantee
trajectory tracking with an arbitrary decay rate, we construct nonlinear,
full-state feedback laws employed at the two boundary ends. Third, a nonlinear
observer is constructed, using measurements from both boundaries, which is
combined with the full-state feedback designs into an observer-based
output-feedback law. All of our designs are explicit since they are constructed
interlacing a feedback linearizing transformation (which we introduce) with
backstepping. Due to the fact that the linearizing transformation is locally
invertible, only regional stability results are established, which are,
nevertheless, accompanied with region of attraction estimates. Our stability
proofs are based on the utilization of the linearizing transformation together
with the employment of backstepping transformations, suitably formulated to
handle the case of bilateral actuation and sensing. We illustrate the developed
methodologies via application to traffic flow control and we present consistent
simulation results.

substantially. Historically, this has been treated as a local, or single-agent,
optimization problem. However, many buildings utilize the same types of thermal
equipment e.g. electric heaters and hot water vessels. During operation,
occupants in these buildings interact with the equipment differently thereby
driving them to diverse regions in the state-space. Reinforcement learning
agents can learn from these interactions, recorded as sensor data, to optimize
the overall energy efficiency. However, if these agents operate individually at
a household level, they can not exploit the replicated structure in the
problem. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem can indeed benefit
from multi-agent collaboration by making use of targeted exploration of the
state-space allowing for better generalization. We also investigate trade-offs
between integrating human knowledge and additional sensors. Results show that
savings of over 40% are possible with collaborative multi-agent systems making
use of either expert knowledge or additional sensors with no loss of occupant
comfort. We find that such multi-agent systems comfortably outperform
comparable single agent systems.

uncertainty quantification and uncertainty propagation in parameters describing

thirty-one parameters focusing on the H2O2 and HO2 reactions resulting from
conditioning on ninety-one experiments. Established literature values are used
for the remaining parameters in the mechanism. The samples are computed using
an affine invariant sampler starting with broad, noninformative priors.
Autocorrelation analysis shows that O(1M) samples are sufficient to obtain a
reasonable sampling of the posterior. The resulting distribution identifies
strong positive and negative correlations and several non-Gaussian
characteristics. Using samples drawn from the posterior, we investigate the
impact of parameter uncertainty on the prediction of two more complex flames: a
2D premixed flame kernel and the ignition of a hydrogen jet issuing into a
heated chamber. The former represents a combustion regime similar to the target
experiments used to calibrate the mechanism and the latter represents a
different combustion regime. For the premixed flame, the net amount of product
after a given time interval has a standard deviation of less than 2% whereas
the standard deviation of the ignition time for the jet is more than 10%. The
samples used for these studies are posted online. These results indicate the
degree to which parameters consistent with the target experiments constrain
predicted behavior in different combustion regimes. This process provides a
framework for both identifying reactions for further study from candidate
mechanisms as well as combining uncertainty quantification and propagation to,
ultimately, tie uncertainty in laboratory flame experiments to uncertainty in
end-use numerical predictions of more complicated scenarios.

emission. We investigate if the infall and outflow parameters vary with source
properties, exploring whether regions hosting potentially young active outflows
show similarities or differences with regions harbouring more evolved, possibly
momentum driven, ""fossil"" outflows. SiO emission is detected towards
approximately 46% of the sources. When considering sources with and without an
SiO detection (i.e. potentially active and fossil outflows respectively), only
the $^{12}$CO outflow velocity shows a significant difference between samples,
indicating SiO is more prevalent towards sources with higher outflow
velocities. Furthermore, we find the SiO luminosity increases as a function of
the Herschel 70$\mu$m to WISE 22$\mu$m flux ratio, suggesting the production of
SiO is prevalent in younger, more embedded regions. Similarly, we find
tentative evidence that sources with an SiO detection have a smaller bolometric
luminosity-to-mass ratio, indicating SiO (8-7) emission is associated with
potentially younger regions. We do not find a prevalence towards sources
displaying signatures of infall in our sample. However, the higher energy
HCO$^+$ transitions may not be the best suited tracer of infall at this spatial

that a computationally costly bandwidth selection procedure is unnecessary to
obtain an effective estimator of the error distribution, and that a simpler

can be due to changes in the magnetic field intensity and orientation (Hanle
effect), but also to spatial and temporal variations in the plasma properties.
Measuring the spatial variation of such polarization signal would allow us to
study the properties of the magnetic fields at subgranular scales, but
observations are challenging since both high spatial resolution and high
spectropolarimetric sensitivity are required.
  Aims. We aim to provide observational evidence of the polarization peak
spatial variations, and to analyze the correlation they might have with
granulation.
  Methods. Observations conjugating high spatial resolution and high
spectropolarimetric precision were performed with the Zurich IMaging
POLarimeter, ZIMPOL, at the GREGOR solar telescope, taking advantage of the
adaptive optics system and the newly installed image derotator.
  Results. Spatial variations of the scattering polarization in the Sr i 4607
{\AA} line are clearly observed. The spatial scale of these variations is
comparable with the granular size. Small correlations between the polarization
signal amplitude and the continuum intensity indicate that the polarization is
higher at the center of granules than in the intergranular lanes.

by considering diseases and drugs linked to antimicrobials, as well as
professional and layman descriptions of antimicrobial drugs, all of which we

steady-state is described by the reciprocal and the fluctuation-dissipation
relations. The so-called fluctuation theorems extended the study of
fluctuations far beyond equilibrium. All these results rely on the crucial
assumption that the observer has complete information about the system. Such a
precise control is difficult to attain, hence the following questions are
compelling: Will an observer who has marginal information be able to perform an
effective thermodynamic analysis? Given that such observer will only establish
local equilibrium amidst the whirling of hidden degrees of freedom, by
perturbing the stalling currents will he/she observe equilibrium-like
fluctuations? We model the dynamics of open systems as Markov jump processes on
finite networks. We establish that: 1) While marginal currents do not obey a
full-fledged fluctuation relation, there exist effective affinities for which
an integral fluctuation relation holds; 2) Under reasonable assumptions on the
parametrization of the rates, effective and ""real"" affinities only differ by a
constant; 3) At stalling, i.e. where the marginal currents vanish, a
symmetrized fluctuation-dissipation relation holds while reciprocity does not;
4) There exists a notion of marginal time-reversal that plays a role akin to
that played by time-reversal for complete systems, which restores the
fluctuation relation and reciprocity. The above results hold for
configuration-space currents, and for phenomenological currents provided that
certain symmetries of the effective affinities are respected - a condition
whose range of validity we deem the most interesting question left open to
future inquiry. Our results are constructive and operational: we provide an
explicit expression for the effective affinities and propose a procedure to

Pulse wave velocity (PWV) can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to
study the functioning of cardiovascular system. A stenosis in an artery can
dampen the pulse wave leading to changes in the propagating pulse. Hence, PWV
analysis can be performed to detect a stenosed region in arteries. This paper
presents a numerical study of pulse wave propagation in a stenosed artery by
means of two-way coupled fluid structure interaction (FSI). The computational
model was validated by the comparison of the simulated PWV results with
theoretical values for a healthy artery. Propagation of the pulse waves in the

between the healthy and stenosed arteries including damping of propagating

models that are capable of predicting PWV signatures associated with stenosis
changes. The knowledge gained from these models may increase utility of this
approach for managing patients at risk of stenosis occurrence.

Poincar\'{e} and inverse inequalities are proved for the proposed Galerkin

problems. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and

challenging issue. In this paper, an integrated tumor classification framework
is presented, which aims to exploit information in existing available samples,
and focuses on the small sample problem and unbalanced classification problem.
Firstly, an inverse space sparse representation based classification (ISSRC)
model is proposed by considering the characteristics of gene-based tumor data,
such as sparsity and a small number of training samples. A decision information
factors (DIF)-based gene selection method is constructed to enhance the
representation ability of the ISSRC. It is worth noting that the DIF is
established from reducing clinical misdiagnosis rate and dimension of small
sample data. For further improving the representation ability and
classification stability of the ISSRC, feature learning is conducted on the
selected gene subset. The feature learning method is constructed by
complementing the advantages of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and
deep learning. Without confusion, the ISSRC combined with gene selection and
feature learning is called the integrated ISSRC, whose stability, optimization
and the corresponding convergence are analyzed. Extensive experiments on six
public microarray gene expression datasets show the integrated ISSRC-based
tumor classification framework is superior to classical and state-of-the-art
methods. There are significant improvements in classification accuracy,
specificity and sensitivity, whether there is a tumor in the early diagnosis,
what kind of tumor, or whether metastasis occurs after tumor surgery.

measurements reported by Stauffer et al. (2016). The method of this derivation
is described and the results indicate that the geometric albedo was about 1% or
less at the time of the observations in 2016. Short-term mid-IR variability of
Neptune, evidenced by the Spitzer observations themselves, indicates an albedo
at 3.6 microns ranging from 0.2% to 0.6% with a mean of 0.4%. The corresponding
albedos at 4.5 microns are 0.7%, 1.3% and 0.9%. Furthermore, the 60-year
history of visible-light brightness variations, which show that Neptune was
significantly fainter a few decades ago, suggests that the mid-IR albedo during
that earlier period of time may have been much less than 1%. The albedo values
reported here can have implications for models of Neptune's atmosphere.
However, the mid-IR brightness of Neptune cannot contribute very strongly to
its total albedo because the Sun emits only about 2% of its flux long-ward of 3
micron. By contrast, the Sun emits 42% of its flux at visible and near-UV
wavelengths where the planet's albedo is in the tens of percents.

symmetries of $N=2$, $d=4$ Fayet-Iliopoulos-gauged supergravity discovered in
arXiv:1606.05160 to the domain wall seed leads, after uplifting, to a dyonic

both momentum along the string and rotation along $\phi$. This is the first
instance of using solution-generating techniques in gauged supergravity to add
rotation to a given seed. These solutions all have constant scalar fields. As
was shown in hep-th/0302218, the construction of supersymmetric static magnetic

pairs that are likely to result in major adverse drug reactions (ADR)---with

patients aged 70-79 years have a 34\% risk of DDI when they are dispensed two

demonstrates that age- and female-specific risks from increased polypharmacy
fail by far to explain the observed DDI risks in those populations, suggesting

distribution which is the distribution of the future realization of the asset

distributions are functions of the observed data values and, consequently, the
solution of the optimization problem is expressed in terms of data only and

the traditional approach is based on unknown quantities which are estimated in
the second step leading to a suboptimal solution. We also derive a very useful
stochastic representation of the posterior predictive distribution whose
application leads not only to the solution of the considered optimization

portfolio return used to construct a prediction interval. A Bayesian efficient
frontier, a set of optimal portfolios obtained by employing the posterior

form an ecosystem, creating links from one website to another, and by `liking'

user traffic internally within the ecosystem in a highly partisan manner, with
right-leaning sites linking to and liking other right-leaning sites and
similarly left-leaning sites linking to other sites on the left, thus forming a
filter bubble amongst news producers similar to the filter bubble which has
been widely observed among consumers of partisan news. Whereas there is
activity along both left- and right-leaning sites, right-leaning sites are more
evolved, accounting for a disproportionate number of abandoned websites and
partisan internal links. We also examine demographic characteristics of
consumers of hyper-partisan news and find that some of the more populous

types are also combined to enable the application of specifically trained
motion predictors based on a continuously updated pseudo probabilistic state
classification. Furthermore, the architecture is used to evaluate
motion-specific physical models for starting and stopping and video-based
pedestrian motion classification. A comprehensive dataset consisting of 1068
pedestrian and 494 cyclist scenes acquired at an urban intersection is used for
optimization, training, and evaluation of the different models. The results
show substantial higher classification rates and the ability to earlier
recognize motion state changes with the machine learning approaches compared to
interacting multiple model (IMM) Kalman Filtering. The trajectory prediction
quality is also improved for all kinds of test scenes, especially when starting
and stopping motions are included. Here, 37\% and 41\% lower position errors
were achieved on average, respectively.

  The moduli space of singular flat metrics having unit area on the sphere with
prescribed curvature data can be locally parametrized by certain spaces of
polygons. This can be done by cutting singular flat spheres through length
minimizing geodesics from a fixed singular point to the others. In that case
the space of polygons is a complex vector space of dimension $n-1$ when there
are $n+1$ singular points. Also there is natural area Hermitian form of
signature $(1,n-2)$ on this vector space. In this chapter we calculate the
signature of the area Hermitian form on some spaces of polygons which locally
parametrize the moduli space of singular flat metrics having unit area on the

to the Planck scale domain. The classical/semiclassical gravity (G) domain is
dual (in the precise sense of the classical-quantum duality) to the quantum (Q)
elementary particle domain through the Planck scale. This duality is universal.
From the gravity and quantum variables (G, Q), we define new (QG) quantum
gravity variables QG = (1/2) (G + Q) which include all (classical,
semiclassical and quantum gravity) domains and the elementary particle domain
passing by the Planck scale. Two values of G or Q variables are necessary for
each variable QG. The complete analytic extension of the QG variables is
performed. This allows us to reveal the classical-quantum duality of the
Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time: The exterior regions are
classical/semiclassical while the interior is totally quantum, its boundaries
being the Planck scale. Exterior and interior lose their difference near the
horizon which turns to be quantum dressed, "" l'horizon habille' "". QG variables
are naturally invariant under G --> Q and conversely. Space-time reflections,
antipodal symmetry and PT or CPT symmetry are contained in the QG symmetry,
which also shed insight into the global properties of the Kruskal manifold and
its present renewed interest...(Abridged)

aerial vehicle (UAV) based communication network is a promising solution to
enhance its spectral efficiency. However, for realistic deployment of such a
network, identifying a practical user feedback scheme for NOMA is essential. In
this paper, considering two practical feedback schemes we introduce NOMA
transmission to UAVs acting as aerial base stations (BS) to provide coverage at
a large stadium. In particular, a UAV-BS generates directional beams, and
multiple users are served simultaneously within the same beam employing NOMA
transmission. Each user is considered to have a target rate based on its
quality of service (QoS) requirements. In order to relieve the burden of
tracking and feeding back full channel state information, we consider two
limited feedback schemes as practical alternatives: 1) user distance, and 2)
user angle with respect to beamforming direction under different user region
geometries. Our evaluation results show that NOMA with limited feedback can
provide better sum rates compared to its orthogonal counterpart. Further, based
on the geometry of user region we identify that there is an optimal feedback
scheme and user ordering criteria for NOMA transmission which can maximize sum
rates.

concentration and the formation of delta shock waves are analyzed and
identified in the flux approximation limit of Riemann solutions to the extended

be seen as the model of the magnetogasdynamics with Coulomb-like friction.
Firstly, by introducing a transformation, the Riemann problem for the extended
Chaplygin gas equations with Coulomb-like friction is solved completely.
Secondly, we rigorously show that, as the pressure vanishes, any two-shock
Riemann solution to the nonhomogeneous extended Chaplygin gas equations tends
to a {\delta}-shock solution to the corresponding nonhomogeneous transportation
equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a
weighted {\delta}-measure that forms the {\delta}-shock; any
two-rarefaction-wave Riemann solution to the nonhomogeneous extended Chaplygin
gas equations tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the
correspongding nonhomogeneous transportation equations, and the nonvacuum
intermediate state between the two rarefaction waves tends to a vacuum state.
At last, we also show that, as the pressure approaches the generalized
Chaplygin pressure, any two-shock Riemann solution to the nonhomogeneous
extended Chaplygin gas equations tends to a delta-shock solution to the
correspongding nonhomogeneous generalized Chaplygin gas equations. In a word,
we have generalized all the results about the vanishing pressure limit now
available for homogeneous equations to the nonhomogeneous case.

models for predicting the flow field downstream of a constricted pipe. This
geometry is relevant to arterial stenosis in patients with vascular diseases.
More specifically, the results of Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes

Eddy Simulation (LES) and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) were compared with
experimental measurements. Comparisons included the mean flow and fluctuations
downstream of the constriction. Results showed that the LES model was in better
agreement with the velocity measurements performed using a Laser Doppler
Anemometry (LDA). In addition, although URANS models predicted a wake region
size and mean flow velocities comparable to SRS turbulence models, no
small-scale vortical structures can be observed in the URANS solution due to
the nature of these models. Modeling of these structures would, however, be
helpful when more detailed flow behavior is needed such as in studies of
acoustic sources. Hence, LES would be an optimal turbulence model for the flow
under consideration, especially when sound generation would be of interest.

with the flicker of swapped face in video sequence. This framework contains two
main innovations: 1) the technique of image registration is exploited to align
the source and target video faces for eliminating the flicker or jitter of the
segmented video face sequence; 2) a fast subpixel image registration method is
proposed for farther accuracy and efficiency. Unlike the priori works, it
minimizes the overlapping region and takes spatiotemporal coherence into
account. Flicker in resulted videos is usually caused by the frequently changed
bound of the blending target face and unregistered faces between and along
video sequences. The subpixel image registration method is proposed to solve
the flicker problem. During the alignment process, integer pixel registration
is formulated by maximizing the similarity of images with down sampling
strategy speeding up the process and sub-pixel image registration is a
single-step image match via analytic method. Experimental results show the
proposed algorithm reduces the computation time and gets a high accuracy when
conducting experiments on different data sets.

equal to zero. Besides the Riemannian line element, also Riemann's residual
hypotheses of homogeneity and symmetry are dropped. Surprisingly, the
infinitesimal Pythagorean distance formula reemerges, without the need of being
postulated, as a first approximation to $almost$ $every$ geometry that is
invariant with respect to direction reversal. More in general, the first
approximation to $almost$ $every$ geometry is a one-parameter family of
homogeneous Riemann-Randers line elements, naturally providing the geometrical
framework for a unified theory of the classical electromagnetic and
gravitational fileds. Geometry naturally accounts for the hierarchy between
electromagnetic and gravitational interactions, their different
attractive/repulsive nature, electric charge, CPT symmetry, Maxwell and
Einstein equations. Within this framework higher order terms could describe new
spacetime degrees of freedom of possible large-scale relevance.

  molecular systems","26 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A class of preconditioners is introduced to enhance geometry optimisation and
transition state search of molecular systems. We start from the Hessian of
molecular mechanical terms, decompose it and retain only its positive definite
part to construct a sparse preconditioner matrix. The construction requires
only the computation of the gradient of the corresponding molecular mechanical
terms that are already available in popular force field software packages. For
molecular crystals, the preconditioner can be combined straightforwardly with
the exponential preconditioner recently introduced for periodic systems. The
efficiency is demonstrated on several systems using empirical, semiempirical
and ab initio potential energy surfaces.

  Learning","This is a report on an ongoing project",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain computer interface is the current area of research to provide
assistance to disabled persons. To cope up with the growing needs of BCI
applications, this paper presents an automated classification scheme for
handgrip actions on objects by using Electroencephalography (EEG) data. The
presented approach focuses on investigation of classifying correct and
incorrect handgrip responses for objects by using EEG recorded patterns. The
method starts with preprocessing of data, followed by extraction of relevant
features from the epoch data in the form of discrete wavelet transform (DWT),
and entropy measures. After computing feature vectors, artificial neural
network classifiers used to classify the patterns into correct and incorrect
handgrips on different objects. The proposed method was tested on real dataset,
which contains EEG recordings from 14 persons. The results showed that the
proposed approach is effective and may be useful to develop a variety of BCI
based devices to control hand movements.
