sources, in particular the strong winds from the surrounding accretion disk.
Numerical investigations of the disk wind launching - the simulation of the
accretion-ejection transition - have so far almost only been done for
non-relativistic systems. From these simulations we know that resistivity, or
magnetic diffusivity, plays an important role for the launching process. Here,
we extend this treatment to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GR-MHD)
applying the resistive GR-MHD code rHARM. Our model setup considers a thin
accretion disk threaded by a large-scale open magnetic field. We run a series
of simulations with different Kerr parameter, field strength and diffusivity
level. Indeed we find strong disk winds with, however, mildly relativistic
speed, the latter most probably due to our limited computational domain.
Further, we find that magnetic diffusivity lowers the efficiency of accretion
and ejection, as it weakens the efficiency of the magnetic lever arm of the
disk wind. As major driving force of the disk wind we disentangle the toroidal
magnetic field pressure gradient, however,magneto-centrifugal driving may also
contribute. Black hole rotation in our simulations suppresses the accretion
rate due to an enhanced toroidal magnetic field pressure that seems to be
induced by frame-dragging. Comparing the energy fluxes from the
Blandford-Znajek-driven central spine and the surrounding disk wind, we find
that the total electromagnetic energy flux is dominated by the total matter
energy flux of the disk wind (by a factor 20). The kinetic energy flux of the
matter outflow is comparatively small and comparable to the Blandford-Znajek
electromagnetic energy flux.

called ""geometric prototype"" in Euclidean space. Given a set of patterns, where
each pattern is represented by a (weighted or unweighted) point set, the
geometric prototype can be viewed as the ""mean pattern"" minimizing the total
matching cost to them. As a general model, the problem finds many applications
in the areas like machine learning, data mining, computer vision, etc. The
dimensionality could be either constant or high, depending on the applications.
To our best knowledge, the general geometric prototype problem has yet to be
seriously considered by the theory community. To bridge the gap between theory
and practice, we first show that a small core-set can be obtained to
substantially reduce the data size. Consequently, any existing heuristic or
algorithm can run on the core-set to achieve a great improvement on the
efficiency. As a new application of core-set, it needs to tackle a couple of
challenges particularly in theory. Finally, we test our method on both 2D image

stable even if we run the algorithms on the core-sets much smaller than the

extremely energetic events have been studied in analogy to solar flares. Their
white-light (WL) continuum emission has been interpreted as being produced by
heated ribbons. In this paper we compute the WL emission from overlying flare
loops depending on their density and temperature and show that, under
conditions expected during superflares, the continuum brightening due to
extended loop arcades can significantly contribute to stellar flux detected by
Kepler. This requires electron densities in the loops $10^{12} - 10^{13}$
cm$^{-3}$ or higher. We show that such densities, exceeding those typically
present in solar flare loops, can be reached on M-dwarf and solar-type
superflare stars with large starspots and much stronger magnetic fields. Quite
importantly, the WL radiation of loops is not very sensitive to their
temperature and thus both cool as well as hot loops may contribute. We show
that the WL intensity emergent from optically-thin loops is lower than the
blackbody radiation from flare ribbons, but the contribution of loops to total
stellar flux can be quite important due to their significant emitting areas.
This new scenario for interpreting superflare emission suggests that the
observed WL flux is due to a mixture of the ribbon and loop radiation and can
be even loop-dominated during the gradual phase of superflares.

that, in addition to neutrino masses and dark matter, the scotogenic model also
allows to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via low-scale
leptogenesis. First, we consider the case of two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs)
N_{1,2}, for which we provide an analytical argument why it is impossible to
push the RHN mass scale below M_1^min ~ 10^10 GeV, which is identical to the
value in standard thermal leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw scenario with the
same washout strength. Then, we present a detailed study of the three-RHN case
based on both an analytical and a numerical analysis. In the case of three
RHNs, we obtain a lower bound on the N_1 mass of around 10 TeV. Remarkably
enough, successful low-scale leptogenesis can be achieved without any
degeneracy in the RHN mass spectrum. The only necessary condition is a
suppression in the N_1 Yukawa couplings, which results in suppressed washout
and a small active neutrino mass of around 10^-12 eV. This leads to the
fascinating realization that low-scale leptogenesis in the scotogenic model can
be tested in experiments that aim at measuring the absolute neutrino mass
scale.

quantum Monte Carlo methods allow for the application of a rigorous variational
principle to both ground and excited state wave functions. In tests that
include small, medium, and large band gap materials, optical gaps are predicted
with a mean-absolute-deviation of 3.5% against experiment, less than half the
equivalent errors for typical many-body perturbation theories. The approach is
designed to be insensitive to the choice of density functional, a property we
exploit in order to provide insight into how far different functionals are from
satisfying the assumptions of many body perturbation theory. We explore this
question most deeply in the challenging case of ZnO, where we show that
although many commonly used functionals have shortcomings, there does exist a
one particle basis in which perturbation theory's zeroth order picture is
sound. Insights of this nature should be useful in guiding the future
application and improvement of these widely used techniques.

stimulus can be used as a versatile tool to, e.g., estimate hearing thresholds
or identify subjective tinnitus percepts in rodents. These techniques are based
on the fact that the ASR amplitude can be suppressed by a pre-stimulus of
lower, non-startling intensity, an effect named pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). For
hearing threshold estimation, pure tone pre-stimuli of varying amplitudes are
presented before an intense noise burst serving as startle stimulus. The amount
of suppression of the ASR amplitude as a function of the pre-stimulus intensity
can be used as a behavioral correlate to determine the hearing ability. For
tinnitus assessment, the pure-tone pre-stimulus is replaced by a gap of silence
in a narrowband noise background, a paradigm termed GPIAS (gap-pre-pulse
inhibition of the acoustic startle response). A proper application of these
paradigms depend on a reliable measurement of the ASR amplitudes, an exact
stimulus presentation in terms of frequency and intensity. Here we introduce a
novel open source solution for the construction of a low-cost ASR setup for the
above mentioned purpose. The complete software for data acquisition and
stimulus presentation is written in Python 3.6 and is provided as an anaconda
package. Furthermore, we provide a construction plan for the sensory system
based on low-cost hardware components. Exemplary data show that the ratios
(1-PPI) of the pre and post trauma ASR amplitudes can be well described by a
lognormal distribution being in good accordance to previous studies with
already established setups. Hence, the open access solution described here will
help to further establish the ASR method in many laboratories and thus

the gradual development of the internal stress profile with flexible pressure
sensors distributed along the raft surface. Surprisingly, we observe that the
surface stress screening builds up much more slowly than previously thought and
that the typical screening distance later dramatically decreases. We explain
this behavior in terms of progressive friction mobilization, where the full

displacement. At further stages of compression, rafts of large length-to-width

and passengers maximize their utilities subject to these prices. We study two
related models: a continuous passenger-taxicab setting, similar to the Wardrop

every location is occupied by a set of infinitesimal strategic taxicabs and a
set of infinitesimal non-strategic passengers. In the discrete setting every
location is occupied by a set of strategic agents, taxicabs and passengers,
passengers have differing values for service. We expand the continuous model to
a time-dependent setting and study the corresponding online environment.
  Surge prices are in passenger-taxicab equilibrium if there exists a min cost
flow that moves taxicabs about such that (a) every taxicab follows a best
response, (b) all strategic passengers at $v$ with value above the surge price
$r_v$ for $v$, are served and (c) no strategic passengers with value below

  This paper computes surge prices such that resulting passenger-taxicab
equilibrium maximizes social welfare, and the computation of such surge prices
is in poly time. Moreover, it is a dominant strategy for passengers to reveal
their true values.
  We seek to maximize social welfare in the online environment, and derive
tight competitive ratio bounds to this end. Our online algorithms make use of
the surge prices computed over time and geographic location, inducing

Wannier states with odd-parity phase, while SLG has the $d+id$-wave symmetry

geometry of a suitable target set, which is compact and attractive for the zero
dynamics. On this set, circuit-theoretic aspects come into play, giving rise to
a network potential function which relates the electrical circuit variables to
the machine rotor angles. As it turns out, this energy function is convex in
the edge variables, concave in the node variables and, most importantly, can be
optimized via an intrinsic gradient flow, with its global minimum corresponding
to angle synchronization. The third step consists of explicitly deriving the
steady-state-inducing control action by further refining this sequence of
control-invariant sets. Analogously to solving the so called regulator
equations, we obtain an impedance-based network flow map leading to novel error
coordinates and a shifted energy function. The final step amounts to decoupling
the rotor current dynamics via feedback-linearziation resulting in a cascade
which is used to construct an energy-based controller hierarchically.

density gaussian modes, which are evolved into the observed nonlinear LSS. The
posterior surface of the modes is convex in the linear regime, leading to a
unique global maximum (MAP), but this is no longer guaranteed in the nonlinear
regime. In this paper we investigate the nature of posterior surface using the
recently developed MAP reconstruction method, with a simplified but realistic
N-body simulation as the forward model. The reconstruction method uses
optimization with analytic gradients from back-propagation through the
simulation. For low noise cases we recover the initial conditions well into the
nonlinear regime ($k\sim 1$ h/Mpc) nearly perfectly. We show that the large
scale modes can be recovered more precisely than the linear expectation, which
we argue is a consequence of nonlinear mode coupling. For noise levels
achievable with current and planned LSS surveys the reconstruction cannot
recover very small scales due to noise. We see some evidence of non-convexity,
specially for smaller scales where the non-injective nature of the mappings:
several very different initial conditions leading to the same near perfect
final data reconstruction. We investigate the nature of these phenomena further
using a 1-d toy gravity model, where many well separated local maximas are
found to have identical data likelihood but differ in the prior. We also show
that in 1-d the prior favors some solutions over the true solution, though no
clear evidence of these in 3-d. Our main conclusion is that on very small
scales and for a very low noise the posterior surface is multi-modal and the
global maximum may be unreachable with standard methods, while for realistic
noise levels in the context of the current and next generation LSS surveys MAP
optimization method is likely to be nearly optimal.

enable this operation, each time slot is partitioned into charging and
information reception phases. For this setup, we characterize two performance
metrics: (i) energy coverage and (ii) joint signal-to-interference-plus-noise

model that captures the spatial coupling between the locations of the IoT
devices and the nodes of the wireless network (referred henceforth as the IoT
gateways), which is often ignored in the literature. In particular, we model
the locations of the IoT devices using a Poisson cluster process (PCP) and
assume that some of the clusters have IoT gateways (GWs) deployed at their
centers while the other GWs are deployed independently of the IoT devices. The
level of coupling can be controlled by tuning the fraction of total GWs that
are deployed at the cluster centers. Due to the inherent intractability of
computing the distribution of shot noise process for this setup, we propose two
accurate approximations, using which the aforementioned metrics are
characterized. Multiple system design insights are drawn from our results. For
instance, we demonstrate the existence of optimal slot partitioning that
maximizes the system throughput. In addition, we explore the effect of the
level of coupling between the locations of the IoT devices and the GWs on this

superconformal fixed points are found in a number of contexts to be encoded in

a role is played by the BPS strings on the tensorial Coulomb branch. In this
paper we develop a uniform description of the worldsheet theories of a BPS
string for rank-one 6d SCFTs. These strings are the basic constituents of the
BPS string spectrum of arbitrary rank six-dimensional models, which they
generate by forming bound states. Motivated by geometric engineering in
F-theory, we describe the worldsheet theories of the BPS strings in terms of
topologically twisted 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the presence of $1/2$-BPS
2d $(0,4)$ defects. As the superconformal point of a 6d theory with gauge group
$G$ is approached, the resulting worldsheet theory flows to an
$\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ NLSM with target the moduli space of one $G$ instanton,
together with a nontrivial left moving bundle characterized by the matter
content of the six-dimensional model. We compute the anomaly polynomial and
central charges of the NLSM, and argue that the 6d flavor symmetry $F$ is
realized as a current algebra on the string, whose level we compute. We find
evidence that for generic theories the $G$ dependence is captured at the level
of the elliptic genus by characters of an affine Kac-Moody algebra at negative
level, which we interpret as a subsector of the chiral algebra of the BPS
string worldsheet theory. We also find evidence for a spectral flow relating
the R-R and NS-R elliptic genera. These properties of the string CFTs lead to
constraints on their spectra, which in combination with modularity allow us to
determine the elliptic genera of a vast number of string CFTs, leading also to
novel results for 6d and 5d instanton partition functions.

network is an NP-complete problem [Katz, Barrett, Dill, Julian and Kochenderfer

giving a certified lower bound of the minimum distortion is possible. Current
available methods of computing such a bound are either time-consuming or
delivering low quality bounds that are too loose to be useful. In this paper,
we exploit the special structure of ReLU networks and provide two
computationally efficient algorithms Fast-Lin and Fast-Lip that are able to
certify non-trivial lower bounds of minimum distortions, by bounding the ReLU
units with appropriate linear functions Fast-Lin, or by bounding the local
Lipschitz constant Fast-Lip. Experiments show that (1) our proposed methods
deliver bounds close to (the gap is 2-3X) exact minimum distortion found by
Reluplex in small MNIST networks while our algorithms are more than 10,000
times faster; (2) our methods deliver similar quality of bounds (the gap is
within 35% and usually around 10%; sometimes our bounds are even better) for
larger networks compared to the methods based on solving linear programming
problems but our algorithms are 33-14,000 times faster; (3) our method is
capable of solving large MNIST and CIFAR networks up to 7 layers with more than
10,000 neurons within tens of seconds on a single CPU core.
  In addition, we show that, in fact, there is no polynomial time algorithm
that can approximately find the minimum $\ell_1$ adversarial distortion of a
ReLU network with a $0.99\ln n$ approximation ratio unless
$\mathsf{NP}$=$\mathsf{P}$, where $n$ is the number of neurons in the network.

of a thermodynamic instability, as a result of the surface sublimation at a
given point due to the incidence of light scattered by surrounding features.
Here, based on existing literature, we model the time evolution of penitente
formation as a purely radiation-driven phenomenon. The physical system is
governed by a 1D diffusion equation with a nonlocal source term, which
represents the light coming in from all the line of sight accessible from that
point of the curve. For small perturbations on the initial profile, the surface
undergoes an instability which triggers the formation of spiky structures. For
solar radiation coming in the surface at a given angle, our numerical

conditional feedback. Performing these tasks repeatedly requires a system in
which measurement and feedback decision times are short compared to qubit
coherence times, where the measurement reproduces faithfully the desired
projection, and for which the measurement process has no detrimental effect on
the ability to perform further operations. Here we demonstrate up to 50
sequential measurements of correlations between two beryllium-ion qubits using
a calcium ion ancilla, and implement feedback which allows us to stabilize
two-qubit subspaces as well as Bell states. Multi-qubit mixed-species gates are
used to transfer information from qubits to the ancilla, enabling quantum state
detection with negligible crosstalk to the stored qubits. Heating of the ion
motion during detection is mitigated using sympathetic recooling. A key element
of the experimental system is a powerful classical control system, which
features flexible in-sequence processing to implement feedback control. The

action on permutations, associated to interval exchange transformations (IET)
for the Poincar\'e map on compact orientable translation surfaces. The
equivalence classes on the objects induced by the group action have been
classified by Kontsevich and Zorich in [KZ03] and correspond bijectively to the
connected components of the strata of the moduli space of abelian
differentials.
  In a paper [Boi14] Boissy proposed a Rauzy-type dynamics that acts on a
subset of the permutations (the standard permutations) and conjectured that the
Rauzy classes of this dynamics are exactly the Rauzy classes of the Rauzy
dynamics restricted to standard permutations. In this paper, we apply the
labelling method introduced in [D18] to classify this dynamics thus proving
Boissy's conjecture.

Rauzy dynamics by presenting two new results on the Rauzy classes: An quadratic
algorithm for outputting a path between two connected permutations and a tight
$\Theta(n)$ bound on the diameter of the Rauzy classes for the alternating

$\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, there is $C_2\mathcal{T}$-symmetry protected
$\mathbb{Z}$ classification of two-band subspaces that is obstructed by the
other crystalline symmetries, i.e.~forbidding the trivial phase. This accounts
for all nontrivial Wilson loop windings of split EBRs \textit{that are
independent of the parameterization of the flow of Wilson loops}.~Then, we show
that while Wilson loop winding of split EBRs can unwind when embedded in
higher-dimensional band space, two-band subspaces that remain separated by a
band gap from the other bands conserve their Wilson loop winding, hence
revealing that split EBRs are at least ""stably trivial"", i.e. necessarily
non-trivial in the non-stable (few-band) limit but possibly trivial in the
stable (many-band) limit.~This clarifies the nature of \textit{fragile}
topology that has appeared very recently.~We then argue that in the many-band
limit the stable Wilson loop winding is only determined by the Fu-Kane-Mele
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant implying that further stable topological phases must
belong to the class of higher-order topological insulators.

challenge is how to go beyond discrimination to learn about the underlying
physics. To this end, a powerful tool would be a framework for unsupervised
learning, where the machine learns the intricate high-dimensional contours of
the data upon which it is trained, without reference to pre-established labels.
In order to approach such a complex task, an unsupervised network must be
structured intelligently, based on a qualitative understanding of the data. In
this paper, we scaffold the neural network's architecture around a
leading-order model of the physics underlying the data. In addition to making
unsupervised learning tractable, this design actually alleviates existing
tensions between performance and interpretability. We call the framework
JUNIPR: ""Jets from UNsupervised Interpretable PRobabilistic models"". In this
approach, the set of particle momenta composing a jet are clustered into a
binary tree that the neural network examines sequentially. Training is
unsupervised and unrestricted: the network could decide that the data bears
little correspondence to the chosen tree structure. However, when there is a
correspondence, the network's output along the tree has a direct physical
interpretation. JUNIPR models can perform discrimination tasks, through the
statistically optimal likelihood-ratio test, and they permit visualizations of
discrimination power at each branching in a jet's tree. Additionally, JUNIPR
models provide a probability distribution from which events can be drawn,
providing a data-driven Monte Carlo generator. As a third application, JUNIPR
models can reweight events from one (e.g. simulated) data set to agree with
distributions from another (e.g. experimental) data set.

mechanics, and develop general diagrammatic tools for calculations in random

membrane' governing entanglement growth, which in 1+1D is a directed random
walk in spacetime (or a variant thereof). Using the replica trick to handle the
logarithm in the definition of the $n$th R\'enyi entropy $S_n$, we map the
calculation of the entanglement after a quench to a problem of interacting
random walks. A key role is played by effective classical spins (taking values
in a permutation group) which distinguish between different ways of pairing
spacetime histories in the replicated system. For the second R\'enyi entropy,
$S_2$, we are able to take the replica limit explicitly. This gives a mapping
between entanglement growth and a directed polymer in a random medium at finite
temperature (confirming Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling for entanglement
growth in generic noisy systems). We find that the entanglement growth rate
(`speed') $v_n$ depends on the R\'enyi index $n$, and we calculate $v_2$ and
$v_3$ in an expansion in the inverse local Hilbert space dimension, $1/q$.
These rates are determined by the free energy of a random walk, and of a bound
state of two random walks, respectively, and include contributions of
`energetic' and `entropic' origin. We give a combinatorial interpretation of
the Page-like subleading corrections to the entanglement at late times and

years. This ever increasing number of recorded neurons opens up the possibility
to address new questions and extract higher dimensional stimuli from the
recordings. Modeling neural spike trains as point processes, this task of
extracting dynamical signals from spike trains is commonly set in the context
of nonlinear filtering theory. Particle filter methods relying on importance
weights are generic algorithms that solve the filtering task numerically, but
exhibit a serious drawback when the problem dimensionality is high: they are
known to suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' (COD), i.e. the number of
particles required for a certain performance scales exponentially with the
observable dimensions. Here, we first briefly review the theory on filtering
with point process observations in continuous time. Based on this theory, we
investigate both analytically and numerically the reason for the COD of
weighted particle filtering approaches: Similarly to particle filtering with
continuous-time observations, the COD with point-process observations is due to
the decay of effective number of particles, an effect that is stronger when the
number of observable dimensions increases. Given the success of unweighted
particle filtering approaches in overcoming the COD for continuous- time
observations, we introduce an unweighted particle filter for point-process
observations, the spike-based Neural Particle Filter (sNPF), and show that it
exhibits a similar favorable scaling as the number of dimensions grows.
Further, we derive rules for the parameters of the sNPF from a maximum
likelihood approach learning. We finally employ a simple decoding task to

real-weighted graphs. Our main goal is to characterize exactly which sets of
node sequences, which we call path systems, can be realized as unique shortest
paths in a graph with arbitrary real edge weights. We say that such a path
system is strongly metrizable.
  An easy fact implicit in the literature is that a strongly metrizable path
system must be consistent, meaning that no two of its paths may intersect,
split apart, and then intersect again. Our main result characterizes strong
metrizability via some new forbidden intersection patterns along these lines.
In other words, we describe a family of forbidden patterns beyond consistency,
and we prove that a path system is strongly metrizable if and only if it is
consistent and it avoids all of the patterns in this family. We offer separate
(but closely related) characterizations in this way for the settings of
directed, undirected, and directed acyclic graphs.
  Our characterizations are based on a new connection between shortest paths
and topology; in particular, our new forbidden patterns are in natural
correspondence with two-colored topological $2$-manifolds, which we visualize
as polyhedra. We believe that this connection may be of independent interest,
and we further show that it implies some additional structural corollaries that
seem to suggest new and possibly deep-rooted connections between these areas.

($d\geq 2$), which is referred as the obstacle and $ \epsilon>0$ is
sufficiently small. We first construct a vortex free solution of the form $ u=
\rho_\epsilon (x) e^{i \frac{\Phi_\epsilon}{\epsilon}}$ with $ \rho_\epsilon
(x) \to 1-|\nabla \Phi^\delta(x)|^2, \Phi_\epsilon (x) \to \Phi^\delta (x) $

immiscible multiphase fluid flow in porous media. Later, it was extended to the
black-oil model, whereby the gas component is allowed to dissolve in the oil
phase. Most recently, the SFI approach was extended to fully compositional
isothermal displacements. SFI schemes solve the fully coupled system in two
steps: (1) Construct and solve the pressure equation (flow problem). (2) Solve
the coupled species transport equations for the phase saturations and phase
compositions. Experience indicates that complex interphase mass transfer
behaviors often lead to large numbers of SFI outer iterations compared with the
Fully Implicit (FI) method. Here, we demonstrate that the convergence
difficulties are directly related to the treatment of the coupling between the
flow and transport problems, and we propose a new SFI variant based on a
nonlinear overall-volume balance equation. The first step consists of forming
and solving a nonlinear pressure equation, which is a weighted sum of all the
component mass conservation equations. The second step of the new SFI scheme
entails introducing the overall-mass density as a degree-of-freedom, and
solving the full set of component conservation equations cast in the
natural-variables form. During the second step, the pressure and the
total-velocity fields are fixed. We analyze the `splitting errors' associated
with the compositional SFI scheme, and we show how to control these errors in
order to converge to the same solution as the Fully Implicit (FI) method. This
robust sequential-implicit solution scheme allows for designing numerical
methods and linear solvers that are optimized for the sub-problems of flow and
transport.

emission within the core of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) persisted as an
open question; the problem is to discern between near- and far-site scenarios
with respect to the distance from the super massive central engine. We
investigate this question under the light of a complete sample of low
synchrotron peak (LSP) blazars which is fully characterized along many decades
in the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio up to tens of GeV. We consider the
high-energy emission from bright radio blazars and test for synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC) scenarios in the framework of
localizing the $\gamma$-ray emission sites. Given that the inverse Compton (IC)
process under the EC regime is driven by the abundance of external seed
photons, these photons could be mainly ultraviolet (UV) to X-rays coming from
the accretion disk region and the broad-line region (BLR), therefore close to
the jet launch base; or infrared (IR) seed photons from the dust torus and
molecular cloud spine-sheath, therefore far from jet launch base. We use
enhanced SED information from recent works (including new $\gamma$-ray
detections) to refine the study of Syn to IC peak correlations, which points to
a particular $\gamma$-ray emission site. We show that SSC alone is not enough
to account for the observed SEDs. Our analysis favors an EC scenario under the
Thomson scattering regime, with a dominant IR external photon field. Therefore,
the far-site (i.e., far from the jet launch) is probably the most reasonable
scenario to account for the population properties of bright LSP blazars in
cases modeled with a pure leptonic component. We calculate the photon energy
density associated with the external field at the jet comoving frame to be $\rm
U'_{ext}=1.69 \times 10^{-2}$ erg/cm$^3$, finding good agreement to other
correlated works.

subspaces by describing each point using globally chosen landmarks. These
landmarks serve as anchor points for choosing subspaces. Our method provides a
way to select features that are relevant in the neighborhood around these

encoded in the feature matrix. The final feature representation is a union of
features from all chosen subspaces.

picking, transmission, and storing. It has six fingers that open to form a
closed space to swallow a target strawberry and push other surrounding berries
away from the target. Equipped with three IR sensors, the gripper controls a
manipulator arm to correct for positional error, and can thus pick strawberries
that are not exactly localized by the vision algorithm, improving the
robustness. Experiments show that the gripper is gentle on the berries as it
merely cuts the stem and there is no physical interaction with the berries
during the cutting process. We show that the gripper has close-to-perfect
successful picking rate when addressing isolated strawberries. By including
internal perception, we get high positional error tolerance, and avoid using
slow, high-level closed-loop control. Moreover, the gripper can store several
berries, which reduces the overall travel distance for the manipulator, and
decreases the time needed to pick a single strawberry substantially. The
experiments show that the gripper design decreased picking execution time
noticeably compared to results found in literature.

natural extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) that can
account for non-vanishing neutrino masses. We show that the lightest
right-handed sneutrino can be the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP), while
the Next-to-the LSP (NLSP) is either the lightest left-handed sneutrino or the
left-handed stau, which are natural candidates for the LLPs. We analyze the
displaced vertex signature of the neutral LLP (the lightest left-handed
sneutrino), and the charged tracks associated with the charged LLP (the
left-handed stau). We show that the production cross sections of our neutral
and charged LLPs are relatively large, namely of order ${\cal O}(1)~{\rm fb}$.
Thus, probing these particles at the LHC is quite plausible. In addition, we
find that the displaced di-lepton associated with the lightest left-handed
sneutrino has a large impact parameter that discriminates it from other SM
leptons. We also emphasize that the charged track associated with the
left-handed stau has a large momentum with slow moving charged tracks, hence it
is distinguished from the SM background and therefore it can be accessible at
the LHC.

We then show that this multi-layer construction admits a brand new

extends the usability of graphene even further beyond present experience. A
direct injection of charge carriers into the conduction or valence bands, i.e.,
doping, represents a viable way of shifting the Fermi level. In particular, the
electrochemical doping should be the method of choice, when higher doping
levels are desired and when a firm control of experimental conditions is

combination with in-situ Raman spectroscopy, i.e., the in-situ Raman

level, but it can give information also on eventual stress or disorder in the
material. However, when employing Raman spectroscopy, one of its main strengths
lies in the utilization of isotope engineering during the chemical vapor

networks, once trained, are fixed and remain the same for all test images.
However, in practice, it is highly desirable to establish a progressive
structure for deep neural networks which is able to adapt its inference process
and complexity for images with different visual recognition complexity. In this
work, we develop a multi-stage progressive structure with integrated confidence
analysis and decision policy learning for deep neural networks. This new
framework consists of a set of network units to be activated in a sequential
manner with progressively increased complexity and visual recognition power.
Our extensive experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets
demonstrate that the proposed progressive deep neural network is able to obtain
more than 10 fold complexity scalability while achieving the state-of-the-art
performance using a single network model satisfying different

a rival to the more conventional schools of statistical inference, and to show
that Fisher's intuition concerning the importance of the fiducial argument was
correct. In this regard, methodology outlined in an earlier paper is modified,
enhanced and extended to deal with general inferential problems in which
various parameters are unknown. As a key part of what is put forward, the joint
fiducial distribution of all the parameters of a given model is determined on
the basis of the full conditional fiducial distributions of these parameters by
using an analytical approach or a Gibbs sampling method, the latter of which
does not require these conditional distributions to be compatible. Although the
resulting theory is classified as being ""subjective"", this is essentially due
to the argument that all probability statements made about fixed but unknown
parameters must be inherently subjective. In particular, it is systematically
argued that, in general, there is no need to place a great emphasis on the
difference between the fiducial probabilities derived by using this theory of
inference and objective probabilities. Some important examples of the
application of this theory are presented.

finitely many colors, there is an infinite set $H \subseteq \mathbb N$ such
that all nonempty sums of distinct elements of $H$ have the same color. The
investigation of restricted versions of HT from the computability-theoretic and
reverse-mathematical perspectives has been a productive line of research
recently. In particular, HT$^{\leqslant n}_k$ is the restriction of HT to sums
of at most $n$ many elements, with at most $k$ colors allowed, and HT$^{=n}_k$
is the restriction of HT to sums of \emph{exactly} $n$ many elements and $k$
colors. Even HT$^{\leqslant 2}_2$ appears to be a strong principle, and may
even imply HT itself over RCA$_0$. In contrast, HT$^{=2}_2$ is known to be
strictly weaker than HT over RCA$_0$, since HT$^{=2}_2$ follows immediately
from Ramsey's Theorem for $2$-colorings of pairs. In fact, it was open for
several years whether HT$^{=2}_2$ is computably true.
  We show that HT$^{=2}_2$ and similar results with addition replaced by
subtraction and other operations are not provable in RCA$_0$, or even WKL$_0$.
In fact, we show that there is a computable instance of HT$^{=2}_2$ such that
all solutions can compute a function that is diagonally noncomputable relative
to $\emptyset'$. It follows that there is a computable instance of HT$^{=2}_2$
with no $\Sigma^0_2$ solution, which is the best possible result with respect
to the arithmetical hierarchy. Furthermore, a careful analysis of the proof of
the result above about solutions DNC relative to $\emptyset'$ shows that
HT$^{=2}_2$ implies RRT$^{=2}_2$, the Rainbow Ramsey Theorem for $2$-colorings
of pairs, over RCA$_0$. The most interesting aspect of our construction of
computable colorings as above is the use of an effective version of the
Lov\'asz Local Lemma due to Rumyantsev and Shen.

Multiscale transport equations occur in many geoscientific applications, which

of existing multiscale approaches use spatial multiscale basis functions or
upscaling, and there are very few works that design space-time multiscale
functions to solve the transport equation on a coarse grid. For the time
dependent problems, the use of space-time multiscale basis functions offers
several advantages as the spatial and temporal scales are intrinsically
coupled. By using the GMsFEM idea with a space-time framework, one obtains a
better dimension reduction taking into account features of the solutions in
both space and time. In addition, the time-stepping can be performed using much
coarser time step sizes compared to the case when spatial multiscale basis are
used. Our scheme is based on space-time snapshot spaces and model reduction
using space-time spectral problems derived from the analysis. We give the

of which the popular K-means algorithm constitutes a local minimizer. It is
well known that the solutions of K-means can be arbitrarily distant from the
true MSSC global optimum, and dozens of alternative heuristics have been
proposed for this problem. However, no other algorithm has been predominantly
adopted in the literature. This may be related to differences of computational
effort, or to the assumption that a near-optimal solution of the MSSC has only
a marginal impact on clustering validity. In this article, we dispute this
belief. We introduce an efficient population-based metaheuristic that uses
K-means as a local search in combination with problem-tailored crossover,
mutation, and diversification operators. This algorithm can be interpreted as a
multi-start K-means, in which the initial center positions are carefully
sampled based on the search history. The approach is scalable and accurate,
outperforming all recent state-of-the-art algorithms for MSSC in terms of
solution quality, measured by the depth of local minima. This enhanced accuracy
leads to clusters which are significantly closer to the ground truth than those
of other algorithms, for overlapping Gaussian-mixture datasets with a large
number of features. Therefore, improved global optimization methods appear to
be essential to better exploit the MSSC model in high dimension.

self-dual). The dual geometry is of tremendous role in various fields of pure

similarity between eigenfunctions that allows to reconstruct that geometry. Our
measure of 'similarity' $ \alpha(\phi_{\lambda}, \phi_{\mu})$ between

matrix polynomials used in the literature and we compare them. One of these
condition numbers is a generalization of the Wilkinson condition number for the
standard eigenvalue problem. This number has the disadvantage of only being
defined for finite eigenvalues. In order to give a unified approach to all the
eigenvalues of a matrix polynomial, both finite and infinite, two (homogeneous)
condition numbers have been defined in the literature. In their definition,
very different approaches are used. One of the main goals of this note is to
show that, when the matrix polynomial has a moderate degree, both homogeneous
numbers are essentially the same and one of them provides a geometric
interpretation of the other. We also show how the homogeneous condition numbers
compare with the ""Wilkinson-like"" eigenvalue condition number and how they
extend this condition number to zero and infinite eigenvalues.

renormalization group flow derived from the bare Yang-Mills Lagrangian, and
show that the cancellation of the vacuum energy may arise motivated both from
the renormalization group flow solutions and the effective Yang-Mills action.
In the framework of the effective Savvidy's action, two Mirror minima are
allowed, with exactly equal and hold opposite sign energy densities. At the
cosmological level, we explore the stability of the electric and magnetic
attractor solutions, both within and beyond the perturbation theory, and find
that thanks to these latter the cancellation between the electric and the
magnetic vacua components is achieved at macroscopic space and time
separations. This implies the disappearance of the conformal anomaly in the
classical limit of an effective Yang-Mills theory. In this picture, the
tunneling probability from the Mirror vacua to the other vacua is exponentially
suppressed in the quantum non-thermal state --- similarly to what happens for
electroweak instantonic tunneling solutions. Specifically, we show that, in a
dynamical Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological background,
the Nielsen-Olsen argument --- on the instability of uniform chromo-electric
and chromo-magnetic Mirror vacua --- is subtly violated. The chromo-magnetic
and chromo-electric uniform vacua are unstable only at asymptotic times, when
the attractor to a zero energy density is already reached. The two vacua can
safely decay into one anisotropic vacuum that has zero energy-density. We also
discover a new surprising pattern of solitonic and anti-solitonic space-like
solutions, which are sourced by the Yang-Mills dynamics in FLRW. We dub such
non-perturbative configurations, which are directly related to dynamical
cancellation mechanism of the vacuum energy, as {\it chronons}, or
$\chi$-solutions.

Equality Constraints (ECs) and Inequality Constraints (IECs) is proposed.
Inspired by the Lyapunov continuous-time dynamics stability theory in the
control field, the optimal solution is analogized to the stable equilibrium
point of a finite-dimensional dynamic system and it is solved in an asymptotic
manner. Under the premise that the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality
condition exists, the Dynamic Optimization Equation (DOE), which has the same
dimension to that of the optimization parameter vector, is established and its
solution will converge to the optimal solution of the NLP globally with a
theoretical guarantee. Using the matrix pseudo-inverse, the DOE is valid even
without the linearly independent regularity requirement on the nonlinear
constraints. In addition, the analytic expressions of the Lagrange multipliers
and KKT multipliers, which adjoin the ECs and the IECs respectively during the
entire optimization process, are also derived. Via the proposed method, the NLP
may be transformed to the Initial-value Problem (IVP) to be solved, with mature
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) integration methods. Illustrative examples
are solved and it is shown that the dynamic method developed may produce the
right numerical solutions with high efficiency.

December 2013. This ambitious mission has strict requirements on residual
systematic errors resulting from instrumental corrections in order to meet a
design goal of sub-10 microarcsecond astrometry. During the design and build
phase of the science instruments, various critical calibrations were studied in
detail to ensure that this goal could be met in orbit. In particular, it was
determined that the video-chain offsets on the analogue side of the
analogue-to-digital conversion electronics exhibited instabilities that could
not be mitigated fully by modifications to the flight hardware. We provide a
detailed description of the behaviour of the electronic offset levels on
microsecond timescales, identifying various systematic effects that are known
collectively as offset non-uniformities. The effects manifest themselves as
transient perturbations on the gross zero-point electronic offset level that is
routinely monitored as part of the overall calibration process. Using in-orbit
special calibration sequences along with simple parametric models, we show how
the effects can be calibrated, and how these calibrations are applied to the
science data. While the calibration part of the process is relatively
straightforward, the application of the calibrations during science data
processing requires a detailed on-ground reconstruction of the readout timing
of each charge-coupled device (CCD) sample on each device in order to predict
correctly the highly time-dependent nature of the corrections. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our offset non-uniformity models in mitigating the effects
in Gaia data. We demonstrate for all CCDs and operating instrument and modes on
board Gaia that the video-chain noise-limited performance is recovered in the
vast majority of science samples.

iteratively adapts the believed domain of the unknown offset after each

the scalar DM naturally has a leptophilic nature with a pair annihilating
mainly into the SM SU(2)$_L$ triplet Higgs scalar of Type II Seesaw which, in
turn, decay into leptons. In this work, we consider indirect signatures of this
leptophilic DM and examine the spectrum of the cosmic ray electron/positron
flux from DM pair annihilations in the Galactic halo. Given an astrophysical
background spectrum of the cosmic ray electron/positron flux, we find that the
contributions from DM annihilations can nicely fit the observed data from the
AMS-02, DAMPE and Fermi-LAT collaborations, with a multi-TeV range of DM mass
and a boost factor for the DM annihilation cross section of ${\cal O}(1000)$.
The boost factor has a slight tension with the Fermi-LAT data for gamma-ray
from dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which can be ameliorated with an enhanced local

volumetric functional and structural imaging deep in the brain continue to be a
limiting factor in neuroscience research. Towards overcoming this obstacle, we
present integrated one- and two-photon scanned oblique plane illumination
(SOPi) microscopy which uses a single front-facing microscope objective to
provide light-sheet scanning based rapid volumetric imaging capability at
subcellular resolution. Our planar scan-mirror based optimized light-sheet
architecture allows for non-distorted scanning of volume samples, simplifying
accurate reconstruction of the imaged volume. Integration of both one-photon
(1P) and two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy in the same system allows for
easy selection between rapid volumetric imaging and higher resolution imaging
in scattering media. Using SOPi, we demonstrate deep, large volume imaging
capability inside scattering mouse brain sections and rapid imaging speeds up
to 10 volumes per second in zebrafish larvae expressing genetically encoded
fluorescent proteins GFP or GCaMP6s. SOPi flexibility and steric access makes
it adaptable for numerous imaging applications and broadly compatible with
orthogonal techniques for actuating or interrogating neuronal structure and
activity.

Our first result gives asymptotic formulas for the complex moments of

been computed due to work of Andrade and Jung. Using our asymptotic formulas

In particular, we uncover an interesting feature in the distribution of large

from $M_{\rm BH}

higher than in type~1 quasars of similar redshift; the luminosities of

We developed an efficient numerical algorithm to treat the quantum master
equation for hybridized systems of many photons and a large number of two-level
atoms. By using this method, we characterize the bistability from the viewpoint
of eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the time evolution operator of the quantum
master equation. We investigate the optical bistability within the low
photon-density regime, where the hybridization of photon and atom degrees of
freedom occurs and the resonance spectrum has a double peak structure. We
compared it with the standard optical bistability between the low
photon-density regime and the high photon-density regime, where the photons can
be treated as a classical electromagnetic field and the resonance spectrum has
a single peak structure. We discuss the steady-state properties of the optical
bistability: dependencies of the photon number density on the intensity and the
double peak structure of the photon number distribution inside the bistable
region. As for the dynamical properties, we find that the relaxation timescale
shows an exponential growth with the system size, and reveal how the hysteresis
loop of the optical bistability depends on the size of the system and the
sweeping rate of the driving amplitude. Finally, by investigating the effects
of detuning frequency of the input field, we clarify the characteristic
properties of the present optical bistability within the low photon-density
regime, which are qualitatively different from the standard optical bistable
phenomena.

(SRG) transformation and show that in the on-shell and continuum limits the
pairing gap vanishes. For finite size systems the momentum is quantized and the
on-shell limit is realized for SRG cutoffs comparable to the momentum
resolution. In this case the pairing gap can be computed directly from the
scattering phase-shifts by an energy-shift formula. While the momentum grid is
usually used as an auxiliary way of solving the BCS pairing gap equation, we
show that it actually encodes some relevant physical information, suggesting
that in fact finite grids may represent the finite size of the system.

much harder than that of unlabeled data. Thus, efficient use of unlabeled data
is getting crucial for DNNs. To address the problem, we introduce unsupervised
competitive learning into the convolutional layer, and utilize unlabeled data
for effective representation learning. The results of validation experiments
using a toy model demonstrated that strong representation learning effectively
extracted bases of images into convolutional filters using unlabeled data, and
accelerated the speed of the fine-tuning of subsequent supervised back
propagation learning. The leverage was more apparent when the number of filters
was sufficiently large, and, in such a case, the error rate steeply decreased
in the initial phase of fine-tuning. Thus, the proposed method enlarged the
number of filters in CNNs, and enabled a more detailed and generalized

in computer vision tasks, but their excessive amounts of weight storage and
arithmetic operations prevent them from being adopted in embedded environments.
One of the solutions involves pruning, where certain unimportant weights are
forced to have a value of zero. Many pruning schemes have been proposed, but
these have mainly focused on the number of pruned weights. Previous pruning
schemes scarcely considered ASIC or FPGA accelerator architectures. When these
pruned networks are run on accelerators, the lack of consideration of the
architecture causes some inefficiency problems, including internal buffer
misalignments and load imbalances. This paper proposes a new pruning scheme
that reflects accelerator architectures. In the proposed scheme, pruning is
performed so that the same number of weights remain for each weight group
corresponding to activations fetched simultaneously. In this way, the pruning
scheme resolves the inefficiency problems, doubling the accelerator
performance. Even with this constraint, the proposed pruning scheme reached a
pruning ratio similar to that of previous unconstrained pruning schemes, not
only on AlexNet and VGG16 but also on state-of-the-art very deep networks such
as ResNet. Furthermore, the proposed scheme demonstrated a comparable pruning
ratio on compact networks such as MobileNet and on slimmed networks that were
already pruned in a channel-wise manner. In addition to improving the
efficiency of previous sparse accelerators, it will be also shown that the
proposed pruning scheme can be used to reduce the logic complexity of sparse

using both on-demand and live streaming, for new augmented reality (AR) and
virtual reality (VR) experiences. As in video streaming, hologram streaming
must support network adaptivity and fast startup, but must also moderate large
bandwidths, multiple simultaneously streaming objects, and frequent user
interaction, which requires low delay. In this paper, we introduce the first
system to our knowledge designed specifically for streaming volumetric media.
The system reduces bandwidth by introducing 3D tiles, and culling them or
reducing their level of detail depending on their relation to the user's view
frustum and distance to the user. Our system reduces latency by introducing a
window-based buffer, which in contrast to a queue-based buffer allows
insertions near the head of the buffer rather than only at the tail of the
buffer, to respond quickly to user interaction. To allocate bits between
different tiles across multiple objects, we introduce a simple greedy yet
provably optimal algorithm for rate-utility optimization. We introduce utility
measures based not only on the underlying quality of the representation, but on
the level of detail relative to the user's viewpoint and device resolution.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides superior quality
compared to existing video-streaming approaches adapted to hologram streaming,
in terms of utility and user experience over variable, throughput-constrained
networks.

a density from $n$ observations drawn at random from a $d$-dimensional

noisy version of the original data. Therefore, a more realistic model allows
for the observations to be contaminated with additive noise.
  In this paper, we consider estimation of convex bodies when the additive
noise is distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution, even
though our techniques could easily be adapted to other noise distributions.
Unlike standard methods in deconvolution that are implemented by thresholding a
kernel density estimate, our method avoids tuning parameters and Fourier
transforms altogether. We show that our estimator, computable in $(O(\ln

in Gaussian deconvolution problems. Part of our analysis also involves the

users to install them for various reasons such as collecting personal
information, spreading malware, or simply to increase their advertisement
revenue. Many counterfeits can be identified once installed, however even a
tech-savvy user may struggle to detect them before installation as app icons
and descriptions can be quite similar to the original app. To this end, this
paper proposes to use neural embeddings generated by state-of-the-art
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to measure the similarity between images.
Our results show that for the problem of counterfeit detection a novel approach
of using style embeddings given by the Gram matrix of CNN filter responses
outperforms baseline methods such as content embeddings and SIFT features. We
show that further performance increases can be achieved by combining style
embeddings with content embeddings. We present an analysis of approximately 1.2
million apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential
counterfeits for top-1,000 apps. Under a conservative assumption, we were able
to find 139 apps that contain malware in a set of 6,880 apps that showed high
visual similarity to one of the top-1,000 apps in Google Play Store.

of the sequence of the number of integer partitions with distinct parts (the
strict partitions) as the sequence of the strict partitions of n with at least
three parts, the three largest parts consecutive, and the smallest part at
least two. The name butterfly describes both the sequence's interpretation and
the underlying bijection between the set of strict partitions of positive
integers m with the two largest parts consecutive, and a subset of the same
kind of strict partitions of m+1. Using the cyclotomic polynomials 1-x and
1+x+x^2, we compute generating function identities o the butterfly sequence and
related sequences both as infinite products and as series filtered by the
number of parts of the corresponding partitions, and we see that the number of
partitions of positive integers n with odd parts greater than or equal to 5 is
the sum of three consecutive terms of the butterfly sequence. We also determine
a subtler merging and splitting construction of the butterfly sequence as a
sequence of some of the partitions with odd parts larger or equal to 3, and we
offer a related detailed interpretation of the butterfly sequence as a sequence
of what we define as generalized pentagonal, pentagonal with domino, and
non-pentagonal butterfly partitions. Finally, Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem
and a slightly different specialization of the Jacobi triple product lead to
recursive algorithms to compute the butterfly sequence and related sequences
using pentagonal number sequences and the series of triangular powers.

linear regime by considering the possibility of dark energy perturbations. To
do this, two popular parameterizations, CPL and BA with same number of free
parameters and different redshift dependency have been considered. We integrate
the full relativistic equations to obtain the growth of matter fluctuations for
both clustering and smooth versions of CPL and BA dark energy. The growth rate
is larger (smaller) than the $\Lambda$CDM in the smooth cases when $w<-1$
($w>-1$) but the dark energy clustering gives a larger (smaller) growth index
when $w>-1$ ($w<-1$). We measure the relative difference of the growth rate
with respect to concordance $\Lambda$CDM and study how it changes depending on
the free parameters. Furthermore, it is found that the difference of growth
rates between smooth CPL and BA is negligible, less than $0.5\%$, while for
clustering case, the difference is considerable and might be as large as 2$\%$.
Eventually, using the latest geometrical and growth rate observational data, we
perform an overall likelihood analysis and show that both smooth and clustering
cases of CPL and BA parameterizations are consistent with observations. In
particular, we find the dark energy FoM $\sim70$ for the BA and $\sim30$ for
the CPL which indicates BA model constraints relatively better than CPL one.

estimator which, in terms of the variational characterization of the zero-norm,

shown to arise from an exact penalization problem that not only has a favorable
bilinear structure but also implies a recipe to deliver equivalent DC
estimators such as the SCAD and MCP estimators. We propose a multi-stage convex
relaxation approach (GEP-MSCRA) for computing this estimator, and under a
restricted strong convexity assumption on the design matrix, establish its
theoretical guarantees which include the decreasing of the error bounds for the
iterates to the true coefficient vector and the coincidence of the iterates
after finite steps with the oracle estimator. Finally, we implement the
GEP-MSCRA with the subproblems solved by a semismooth Newton augmented
Lagrangian method (ALM) and compare its performance with that of SLEP and
MALSAR, the solvers for the weighted $\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularized estimator,

Specifically, we approach random Fourier features from a spectral matrix

matrix approximation bounds imply statistical guarantees for kernel ridge

  Qualitatively, our results are twofold: on the one hand, we show that random
Fourier feature approximation can provably speed up kernel ridge regression
under reasonable assumptions. At the same time, we show that the method is
suboptimal, and sampling from a modified distribution in Fourier space, given
by the leverage function of the kernel, yields provably better performance. We
study this optimal sampling distribution for the Gaussian kernel, achieving a
nearly complete characterization for the case of low-dimensional bounded
datasets. Based on this characterization, we propose an efficient sampling
scheme with guarantees superior to random Fourier features in this regime.

self-replication, mutation, and killing of bacteria. When mutation is not
significant, the two strains segregate and form stripe patterns along the
channel. The formed lanes are gradually rearranged, with increasing length
scales in the two-dimensional cross-sectional plane. We characterize it in
terms of coarsening and phase ordering in statistical physics. In particular,
for the simple model without mutation and killing, we find logarithmically slow
coarsening, which is characteristic of the two-dimensional voter model. With
mutation and killing, we find a phase transition from a monopolistic phase, in
which lanes are formed and coarsened until the system is eventually dominated
by one of the two strains, to an equally mixed and disordered phase without
lane structure. Critical behavior at the transition point is also studied and
compared with the generalized voter class and the Ising class. These results
are accounted for by continuum equations, obtained by applying a mean field

Chern-Simons (CS) density we call a Higgs-Chern-Simons (HCS) density. This
generalizes the construction of gravitational systems resulting from
non-Abelian CS densities in all odd dimensions. The new HCS densities employed
here are arrived at by the usual one-step descent of new
Higgs--Chern-Pontryagin (HCP) densities, the latter resulting from the
dimensional reduction of Chern-Pontryagin (CP) densities in some even
dimension, such that in any given dimension (including even) there is an
infinite tower of such models. Here, we restrict our attention to the lowest
dimension, 2+1, and to the simplest such model resulting from the dimensional
reduction of the $3$-rd CP density. We construct a black hole (BH) solution in
closed form, generalizing the familiar BTZ BH. We also study the electrically
charged BH solution of the same model augmented with a Maxwell term, and
contrast this solution with the electrically charged BTZ BH, specifically
concering their respective thermodynamic properties.

  Principle","Preprint before review",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We tackle the problem of penalty selection of regularization on the basis of
the minimum description length (MDL) principle. In particular, we consider that
the design space of the penalty function is high-dimensional. In this
situation, the luckiness-normalized-maximum-likelihood(LNML)-minimization
approach is favorable, because LNML quantifies the goodness of regularized
models with any forms of penalty functions in view of the minimum description
length principle, and guides us to a good penalty function through the
high-dimensional space. However, the minimization of LNML entails two major
challenges: 1) the computation of the normalizing factor of LNML and 2) its
minimization in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present a novel
regularization selection method (MDL-RS), in which a tight upper bound of LNML
(uLNML) is minimized with local convergence guarantee. Our main contribution is
the derivation of uLNML, which is a uniform-gap upper bound of LNML in an
analytic expression. This solves the above challenges in an approximate manner
because it allows us to accurately approximate LNML and then efficiently
minimize it. The experimental results show that MDL-RS improves the
generalization performance of regularized estimates specifically when the model
has redundant parameters.

reciprocity theorem) plays a crucial role in a wide assortment of cosmological
measurements. Attempts at confirming it observationally have met with mixed
results, though the general consensus appears to be that the data do support
its existence in nature. A common limitation with past approaches has been
their reliance on a specific cosmological model, or on measurements of the
luminosity distance to Type Ia SNe, which introduces a dependence on the
presumed cosmology in spite of beliefs to the contrary. Confirming that the CDD
is actually realized in nature is crucial because its violation would require
exotic new physics. In this paper, we study the CDD using the observed angular
size of compact quasar cores and a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the HII
galaxy Hubble diagram---without pre-assuming any particular background
cosmology. In so doing, we confirm at a very high level of confidence that the
angular-diameter and luminosity distances do indeed satisfy the CDD. We then
demonstrate the potential power of this result by utilizing it in a comparative
test of two competing cosmological models---the R_h=ct universe and LCDM---and
show that R_h=ct is favoured by the CDD data with a likelihood ~82.3% compared

been widely studied in computer science. While the problem of estimating edit
distance has been studied extensively, the equally important question of
actually producing an alignment (i.e., the sequence of edits) has received far
less attention. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that any algorithm to estimate
edit distance can be used in a black-box fashion to produce an approximate
alignment of strings, with modest loss in approximation factor and small loss
in run time. Plugging in the result of Andoni, Krauthgamer, and Onak, we obtain
an alignment that is a $(\log n)^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ approximation in time
$\tilde{O}(n^{1 + \varepsilon})$.
  Closely related to the study of approximation algorithms is the study of
metric embeddings for edit distance. We show that min-hash techniques can be
useful in designing edit distance embeddings through three results: (1) An
embedding from Ulam distance (edit distance over permutations) to Hamming space
that matches the best known distortion of $O(\log n)$ and also implicitly
encodes a sequence of edits between the strings; (2) In the case where the edit
distance between the input strings is known to have an upper bound $K$, we show
that embeddings of edit distance into Hamming space with distortion $f(n)$ can
be modified in a black-box fashion to give distortion
$O(f(\operatorname{poly}(K)))$ for a class of periodic-free strings; (3) A
randomized dimension-reduction map with contraction $c$ and asymptotically
optimal expected distortion $O(c)$, improving on the previous $\tilde{O}(c^{1 +
2 / \log \log \log n})$ distortion result of Batu, Ergun, and Sahinalp.

proposed to explain the presence of strong fields in certain classes of
magnetic stars. In the case of the high field magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs),
the site of the differential rotation has been variously thought to be the
common envelope, the hot outer regions of a merged degenerate core or an
accretion disc formed by a tidally disrupted companion that is subsequently
accreted by a degenerate core. We have shown previously that the observed
incidence of magnetism and the mass distribution in HFMWDs are consistent with
the hypothesis that they are the result of merging binaries during common
envelope evolution. Here we calculate the magnetic field strengths generated by
common envelope interactions for synthetic populations using a simple
prescription for the generation of fields and find that the observed magnetic
field distribution is also consistent with the stellar merging hypothesis. We
use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to study the correlation between the calculated
and the observed field strengths and find that it is consistent for low
envelope ejection efficiency. We also suggest that field generation by the
plunging of a giant gaseous planet on to a white dwarf may explain why
magnetism among cool white dwarfs (including DZ white dwarfs) is higher than
among hot white dwarfs. In this picture a super Jupiter residing in the outer
regions of the planetary system of the white dwarf is perturbed into a highly
eccentric orbit by a close stellar encounter and is later accreted by the white
dwarf.

Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT), it is shown that the obtained non-asymptotically
flat wormhole solution yields a topological term in the deflection angle of

the impact factor parameter. Significantly, we showed that the bumblebee

regularized (linear shrinkage) modifications of Maronna's classical

simultaneously being well-defined when the number of samples does not exceed

characterize the asymptotic performance of such estimators when the numbers of

that, when outliers are absent, many estimators of the regularized-Maronna type
share the same asymptotic performance, and for these estimators we present a
data-driven method for choosing the asymptotically optimal regularization
parameter with respect to a quadratic loss. Robustness in the presence of
outliers is then studied: in the non-regularized case, a large-dimensional
robustness metric is proposed, and explicitly computed for two particular types
of estimators, exhibiting interesting differences depending on the underlying
contamination model. The impact of outliers in regularized estimators is then
studied, with interesting differences with respect to the non-regularized case,

  Methods. The Jupiter Trojans are divided into two groups: (1) the 226 biggest
ones with absolute magnitudes $H<11$, have well determined masses and are
treated as individual bodies; (2) the remaining small ones with $H\geqslant11$,
are modeled by two discrete arcs centered at Jupiter's L4 and L5 points,
respectively. Then we derived the parameters characterizing the arcs, such as
the total mass, the mass ratio, and the spatial distributions. Uncertainties on
the fitted parameters have also been taken into account.
  Results. We find that the total mass of all the Jupiter Trojans, including
the undiscovered ones, is most likely about $1.861\times 10^{-5}$ Earth mass.

distance is numerically estimated to be about 70 m during the 2014-2114 time

one-particle reduced density matrix (1RDM) for equilibrium systems at finite
temperature. The starting point of our formulation is the grand potential
$\Omega [\mathbf{G}]$ regarded as variational functional of the Green's
function $G$ based on diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory and for which
we consider either the Klein or Luttinger-Ward form. By restricting the input
Green's function to be one-to-one related to a set on one-particle reduced
density matrices (1RDM) this functional becomes a functional of the 1RDM. To
establish the one-to-one mapping we use that, at any finite temperature and for
a given 1RDM $\mathbf{\gamma}$ in a finite basis, there exists a
non-interacting system with a spatially non-local potential
$v[\mathbf{\gamma}]$ which reproduces the given 1RDM. The corresponding set of
non-interacting Green's functions defines the variational domain of the
functional $\Omega$. In the zero temperature limit we obtain an energy
functional $E[\mathbf{\gamma}]$ which by minimisation yields an approximate
ground state 1RDM and energy. As an application of the formalism we use the
Klein and Luttinger-Ward functionals in the GW-approximation compute the
binding curve of a model hydrogen molecule using an extended Hubbard
Hamiltonian. We compare further to the case in which we evaluate the
functionals on a Hartree-Fock and a Kohn-Sham Green's function. We find that
the Luttinger-Ward version of the functionals performs the best and is able to
reproduce energies close to the GW energy which corresponds to the stationary
point.

unify (1) segmenting entity/relation phrases in individual sentences based on
local context; and (2) measuring the quality of tuples extracted from
individual sentences with a translating-based objective. Learning the two

Fay-Herriot model where covariance matrix of random effects are fully unknown.
The covariance matrix is estimated by a Prasad-Rao type consistent estimator,

area characteristics is provided. When the EBLUP is measured in terms of a mean

observable for the chiral magnetic effect - in a large class of planar strongly
correlated gauge theories with dual string description. When the effects of
anomalies are suppressed, the diffusion rate is simply given in terms of
temperature, entropy density and gauge coupling, with a universal numerical
coefficient. We show that this result holds, in fact, for all the top-down
holographic models where the calculation has been performed in the past, even
in presence of magnetic fields and anisotropy. We also extend the check to
further well known models for which the same computation was lacking. Finally
we point out some subtleties related to the definition of the Chern-Simons
diffusion rate in the presence of anomalies. In this case, the usual definition
of the rate - a late time limit of the imaginary part of the retarded
correlator of the topological charge density - would give an exactly vanishing
result, due to its relation with a non-conserved charge correlator. We confirm
this observation by explicit holographic computations on generic isotropic
black hole backgrounds. Nevertheless, a non-trivial Chern-Simons relaxation
time can in principle be extracted from a quasi-normal mode calculation.

for distributed software systems. Compared to Service-oriented Architecture
(SOA), MSA puts a stronger focus on self-containment of services. Each
microservice is responsible for realizing exactly one business or technological
capability that is distinct from other services' capabilities. Additionally, on
the implementation and operation level, microservices are self-contained in
that they are developed, tested, deployed and operated independently from each
other. Next to these characteristics that distinguish MSA from SOA, both
architectural styles rely on services as building blocks of distributed
software architecture and hence face similar challenges regarding, e.g.,
service identification, composition and provisioning. However, in contrast to
MSA, SOA may rely on an extensive body of knowledge to tackle these challenges.
Thus, due to both architectural styles being service-based, the question arises
to what degree MSA might draw on existing findings of SOA research and
practice. In this paper we address this question in the field of Model-driven
Development (MDD) for design and operation of service-based architectures.
Therefore, we present an analysis of existing MDD approaches to SOA, which
comprises the identification and semantic clustering of modeling concepts for
SOA design and operation. For each concept cluster, the analysis assesses its
applicability to MDD of MSA (MSA-MDD) and assigns it to a specific modeling
viewpoint. The goal of the presented analysis is to provide a conceptual
foundation for an MSA-MDD metamodel.

formation of a small solid embryo (nucleus), which requires surmounting an
activation barrier. This phenomenon is most easily studied by numerical
simulation, using specialized biased-sampling techniques to overcome the
limitations imposed by the rarity of nucleation events. Here, I focus on the
barrier to homogeneous ice nucleation in supercooled water, as represented by
the monatomic-water model, which in the bulk exhibits a complex interplay
between different ice structures. I consider various protocols to identify
solidlike particles on a computer, which perform well enough for the
Lennard-Jones model, and compare their respective impact on the shape and
height of the nucleation barrier. It turns out that the effect is stronger on
the nucleus size than on the barrier height. As a by-product of the analysis, I
determine the structure of the nucleation cluster, finding that the relative
amount of ice phases in the cluster heavily depends on the method used for
classifying solidlike particles. Moreover, the phase which is most favored
during the earlier stages of crystallization may happen, depending on the
nucleation coordinate adopted, to be different from the stable polymorph.
Therefore, the quality of a reaction coordinate cannot be assessed simply on
the basis of the barrier height obtained. I explain how this outcome is
possible and why it just points out the shortcoming of collective variables
appropriate to simple fluids in providing a robust method of particle
classification for monatomic water.

also confirm the previously tentative CI detection around V Hya, a carbon-rich
AGB star. As one of the main photodissociation products of parent species in
the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars, CI can be used to trace
sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in CSEs. The observed flux density
towards omi Cet can be reproduced by a shell with a peak atomic fractional
abundance of $2.4 \times 10^{-5}$ predicted based on a simple chemical model
where CO is dissociated by the interstellar radiation field. However, the CI
emission is shifted by $\sim$ 4 km/s from the stellar velocity. Based on this
velocity shift, we suggest that the detected CI emission towards omi Cet
potentially arises from a compact region near its hot binary companion. The
velocity shift could, therefore, be the result of the orbital velocity of the
binary companion around omi Cet. In this case, the CI column density is
estimated to be $1.1 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. This would imply that strong UV
radiation from the companion and/or accretion of matter between two stars is
most likely the origin of the CI enhancement. However, this hypothesis can be
confirmed by high-angular resolution observations.

gained much popularity recently. To maintain a canonical state of blockchain
data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes,
referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block
of transactions through a process of ""block mining"" by solving a cryptographic
puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g.,
mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to
offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing
servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing
service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for
efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a
proof-of-work based blockchain network. Due to the competition among miners in
the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken
into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider
two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a
fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can
submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding
scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare.
In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is
NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the
truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through
extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the
two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the
blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing
service provider.

dividing value of 0.01, which is estimated from the MIR-based bolometric
luminosity and the black hole masses. While most FRII radio galaxies have
higher Eddington ratio than FRIs, we found that there is indeed no single
correspondence between the FR morphology and accretion mode with eight FRIIs at
low accretion and two FRIs at high accretion rate. There is a significant
correlation between the VLBA core luminosity at 5 GHz and the Eddington ratio.
Various morphologies are found in our sample, including core only, single-sided
core-jet, and two-sided core-jet structures. We found that the higher accretion
rate may be more likely related with the core-jet structure, thus more extended
jet. These results imply that the higher accretion rates are likely able to
produce more powerful jets. There is a strong correlation between the MIR
luminosity at 15 $\mu$m and VLBA 5 GHz core luminosity, in favour of the tight
relation between the accretion disk and jets. In our sample, the core
brightness temperature ranges from $10^{9}$ to $10^{13.38}$ K with a median

the task of computing linear SSP coefficients of explicit one-step methods is,

quadratures with integer nodes with respect to Poisson-Charlier measures. Using
this equivalence, we provide sharp upper and lower bounds for the optimal
linear SSP coefficients in terms of the zeros of generalized Laguerre

for the optimal SSP coefficients of explicit Runge-Kutta methods. Also based on
this equivalence, we propose a highly efficient and stable algorithm for

algorithm possesses the remarkable property that its complexity depends only on
the order of the method and thus is independent of the number of stages. Our
results are achieved by adapting and extending an ingenious technique by
Bernstein in his seminal work on absolutely monotonic functions. Moreover, the
techniques introduced in this work can be adapted to solve the integer

  Cosmochimica Acta",,"10.1016/j.gca.2017.06.006",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We compare literature data for the isotopic ratios of Zr, Sr, and Ba from
analysis of single meteoritic stardust silicon carbide (SiC) grains to new
predictions for the slow neutron-capture process (the s process) in metal-rich
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The models have initial metallicities Z =
0.014 (solar) and Z = 0.03 (twice-solar) and initial masses 2 - 4.5 Msun,
selected such as the condition C/O>1 for the formation of SiC is achieved.
Because of the higher Fe abundance, the twice-solar metallicity models result
in a lower number of total free neutrons released by the 13C({\alpha},n)16O
neutron source. Furthermore, the highest-mass (4 - 4.5 Msun) AGB stars of
twice-solar metallicity present a milder activation of the 22Ne({\alpha},n)25Mg
neutron source than their solar metallicity counterparts, due to cooler
temperatures resulting from the effect of higher opacities. They also have a
lower amount of the 13C neutron source than the lower-mass models, following
their smaller He-rich region. The combination of these different effects allows
our AGB models of twice-solar metallicity to provide a match to the SiC data
without the need to consider large variations in the features of the 13C
neutron source nor neutron-capture processes different from the s process. This
raises the question if the AGB parent stars of meteoritic SiC grains were in
fact on average of twice-solar metallicity. The heavier-than-solar Si and Ti
isotopic ratios in the same grains are in qualitative agreement with an origin
in stars of super-solar metallicity because of the chemical evolution of the
Galaxy. Further, the SiC dust mass ejected from C-rich AGB stars is predicted
to significantly increase with increasing the metallicity.

approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods,
calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With
high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred
from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by
accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include
theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing ($\Delta
\nu$) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero point of the frequency of
maximum power ($\nu_{\rm max}$) relation to be consistent with masses and radii
for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by
different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from
the pipeline-predicted random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method
not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the
usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population
studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators
is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic
mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%. Median random and systematic
mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level respectively for RC stars.

and thus ostensibly has bearings on (A)dS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ holography. In this
paper we focus on the four-dimensional case, although the higher or
lower-dimensional generalization is straightforward. As is the case with pair
productions near black hole and de Sitter horizons, we show that the BT
instanton action for a membrane nucleation encodes the first law of

precisely accounts for the change of entropy of (A)dS space before and after

(1) The deployment of social honeypots for harvesting information of malicious

eigenstates, in both continuum and lattice theories, in both one (1D) and two
dimensions (2D). In the ordered phase, the presence of a confining longitudinal
field leads to a profound restructuring of the excitation spectrum, with the
low-energy two-particle continuum being replaced by discrete 'meson' modes
(linearly confined pairs of domain walls). These modes exist far into the
spectrum and are atypical, in the sense that expectation values in the state
with energy $E$ do not agree with the microcanonical (thermal) ensemble
prediction. Single meson states persist above the two meson threshold, due to a
surprising lack of hybridization with the ($n\geq4$)-domain wall continuum, a
result that survives into the thermodynamic limit and that can be understood
from analytical calculations. The presence of such states is revealed in
anomalous post-quench dynamics, such as the lack of a light cone, the
suppression of the growth of entanglement entropy, and the absence of
thermalization for some initial states. The nonthermal states are confined to
the ordered phase - the disordered (paramagnetic) phase exhibits typical
thermalization patterns in both 1D and 2D in the absence of integrability.

However, these stable matchings can have different sizes, and the problem of
finding a maximum stable matching (MAX-SPA-P) is NP-hard. There are two known

MAX-SPA-P to be solved optimally. Following this, we present results arising
from an empirical analysis that investigates how the solution produced by the
approximation algorithms compares to the optimal solution obtained from the IP
model, with respect to the size of the stable matchings constructed, on
instances that are both randomly-generated and derived from real datasets. Our
main finding is that the 3/2-approximation algorithm finds stable matchings

its low spin-orbit coupling, negligible hyperfine interaction, and high
electron mobility are obvious advantages for transporting spin information over
long distances. However, such outstanding transport properties also limit the
capability to engineer active spintronics, where strong spin-orbit coupling is
crucial for creating and manipulating spin currents. To this end, transition
metal dichalcogenides, which have larger spin-orbit coupling and good interface
matching, appear to be highly complementary materials for enhancing the
spin-dependent features of graphene while maintaining its superior charge
transport properties. In this review, we present the theoretical framework and
the experiments performed to detect and characterize the spin-orbit coupling
and spin currents in graphene/transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures.
Specifically, we will concentrate on recent measurements of Hanle precession,
weak antilocalization and the spin Hall effect, and provide a comprehensive
theoretical description of the interconnection between these phenomena.

to achieve better performance in many applications of AI. Such DNNs however
require huge amounts of memory to store weights and intermediate results (e.g.,
activations, feature maps, etc.) in propagation. This requirement makes it
difficult to run the DNNs on devices with limited, hard-to-extend memory,
degrades the running time performance, and restricts the design of network
models. We address this challenge by developing a novel profile-guided memory
optimization to efficiently and quickly allocate memory blocks during the
propagation in DNNs. The optimization utilizes a simple and fast heuristic
algorithm based on the two-dimensional rectangle packing problem. Experimenting
with well-known neural network models, we confirm that our method not only
reduces the memory consumption by up to $49.5\%$ but also accelerates training
and inference by up to a factor of four thanks to the rapidity of the memory
allocation and the ability to use larger mini-batch sizes.

  and Surgery",,"10.1007/s11548-018-1777-8",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  \textit{Purpose} Estimating the interaction forces of instruments and tissue
is of interest, particularly to provide haptic feedback during robot assisted
minimally invasive interventions. Different approaches based on external and
integrated force sensors have been proposed. These are hampered by friction,
sensor size, and sterilizability. We investigate a novel approach to estimate
the force vector directly from optical coherence tomography image volumes.
  \textit{Methods} We introduce a novel Siamese 3D CNN architecture. The
network takes an undeformed reference volume and a deformed sample volume as an
input and outputs the three components of the force vector. We employ a deep
residual architecture with bottlenecks for increased efficiency. We compare the
Siamese approach to methods using difference volumes and two-dimensional
projections. Data was generated using a robotic setup to obtain ground truth
force vectors for silicon tissue phantoms as well as porcine tissue.
  \textit{Results} Our method achieves a mean average error of 7.7 +- 4.3 mN
when estimating the force vector. Our novel Siamese 3D CNN architecture
outperforms single-path methods that achieve a mean average error of 11.59 +-
6.7 mN. Moreover, the use of volume data leads to significantly higher
performance compared to processing only surface information which achieves a
mean average error of 24.38 +- 22.0 mN. Based on the tissue dataset, our
methods shows good generalization in between different subjects.
  \textit{Conclusions} We propose a novel image-based force estimation method
using optical coherence tomography. We illustrate that capturing the
deformation of subsurface structures substantially improves force estimation.
Our approach can provide accurate force estimates in surgical setups when using
intraoperative optical coherence tomography.

equipped with weighted Lebesgue measures and norm induced metrics. Our main
result is a necessary condition saying that all such functions solve a certain
homogeneous system of elliptic PDEs. Moreover, a converse result is established
in case of analytic weights. Assuming Sobolev regularity of weight $w \in
W^{l,\infty}$ we show that strongly harmonic functions are as well in
$W^{l,\infty}$ and that they are analytic, whenever the weight is analytic.
  The analysis is illustrated by finding all mean-value harmonic functions in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ for the $l^p$-distance $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. The essential
outcome is a certain discontinuity with respect to $p$, i.e. that for all $p
\ne 2$ there are only finitely many linearly independent mean-value harmonic
functions, while for $p=2$ there are infinitely many of them. We conclude with
a remarkable observation that strongly harmonic functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$
possess the mean value property with respect to infinitely many weight
functions obtained from a given weight.

function defined in three space dimensions from its geodesic X-ray transform.
The standard X-ray transform is defined on the Euclidean metric and is given by
the integration of a function along straight lines. The geodesic X-ray
transform is the generalization of the standard X-ray transform in Riemannian
manifolds and is defined by integration of a function along geodesics. This
paper is motivated by Uhlmann and Vasy's theoretical reconstruction algorithm
for geodesic X-ray transform and mathematical formulation for traveltime
tomography to develop a novel numerical algorithm for the stated goal. Our
numerical scheme is based on a Neumann series approximation and a layer
stripping approach. In particular, we will first reconstruct the unknown
function by using a convergent Neumann series for each small neighborhood near
the boundary. Once the solution is constructed on a layer near the boundary, we
repeat the same procedure for the next layer, and continue this process until
the unknown function is recovered on the whole domain. One main advantage of
our approach is that the reconstruction is localized, and is therefore very
efficient, compared with other global approaches for which the reconstructions
are performed on the whole domain. We illustrate the performance of our method
by showing some test cases including the Marmousi model. Finally, we apply this
method to a travel time tomography in 3D, in which the inversion of the
geodesic X-ray transform is one important step, and present several numerical
results to validate the scheme.

scales linearly with the number of measured samples. Regularization is obtained
by minimizing the norms of the convolution between the reconstructed image and
a set of spatial filters, and the final reconstruction formula can be expressed
in terms of matrix pseudoinverse. At high compression this approach is an
interesting alternative to the methods of compressive sensing based on l1-norm
optimization, which are too slow for real-time applications. For instance, we
demonstrate experimental single-pixel detection with real-time reconstruction
obtained in parallel with the measurement at the frame rate of $11$ Hz for
highly compressive measurements with the resolution of $256\times 256$. For
this purpose, we preselect the sampling functions to match the average spectrum
obtained with an image database. The sampling functions are selected from the
Walsh-Hadamard basis, from the discrete cosine basis, or from a subset of
Morlet wavelets convolved with white noise. We show that by incorporating the
quadratic criterion into the closed-form reconstruction formula, we are able to
use binary rather than continuous sampling reaching similar reconstruction
quality as is obtained by minimizing the total variation. This makes it
possible to use cosine or Morlet-based sampling with digital micromirror
devices without advanced binarization methods.

are closely connected to rational functions with nonnegative coefficients. We
show that the post-selected classical query complexity of a Boolean function is
equal to the minimal degree of a rational function with nonnegative
coefficients that approximates it (up to a factor of two). For post-selected
quantum query algorithms, a similar relationship was shown by Mahadev and de
Wolf, where the rational approximations are allowed to have negative
coefficients. Using our characterisation, we find an exponentially large
separation between post-selected classical query complexity and post-selected
quantum query complexity, by proving a lower bound on the degree of rational
approximations (with nonnegative coefficients) to the Majority function. This
lower bound can be generalised to arbitrary symmetric functions, and allows us
to find an unbounded separation between non-deterministic quantum and
post-selected classical query complexity. All lower bounds carry over into the
communication complexity setting.
  We show that the zero-error variants of post-selected query algorithms are
equivalent to non-deterministic classical query algorithms, which in turn are
characterised by nonnegative polynomials, and for some problems require
exponentially more queries to the input than their bounded-error counterparts.
Finally, we describe a post-selected query algorithm for approximating the
Majority function, and an efficient query algorithm for approximate counting.

account, a new generalized symmetric metric connection was attained upon

provided through calculation of tensors belonging to Kenmotsu manifold

coincircular curvature tensor. Ultimately, an original example was presented.

  Zhang, Ajmal Mian","Deep Keyframe Detection in Human Action Videos",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting representative frames in videos based on human actions is quite
challenging because of the combined factors of human pose in action and the
background. This paper addresses this problem and formulates the key frame
detection as one of finding the video frames that optimally maximally
contribute to differentiating the underlying action category from all other
categories. To this end, we introduce a deep two-stream ConvNet for key frame
detection in videos that learns to directly predict the location of key frames.
Our key idea is to automatically generate labeled data for the CNN learning
using a supervised linear discriminant method. While the training data is
generated taking many different human action videos into account, the trained
CNN can predict the importance of frames from a single video. We specify a new
ConvNet framework, consisting of a summarizer and discriminator. The summarizer
is a two-stream ConvNet aimed at, first, capturing the appearance and motion
features of video frames, and then encoding the obtained appearance and motion
features for video representation. The discriminator is a fitting function
aimed at distinguishing between the key frames and others in the video. We
conduct experiments on a challenging human action dataset UCF101 and show that
our method can detect key frames with high accuracy.

the process noise in the block-oriented model for accurate nonlinear modeling.
To this end, the response of a Wiener-Hammerstein system is theoretically
analyzed, the disturbance component in the output, caused by the process noise
preceding the static nonlinearity, is shown to be dependent on the input
signal. Inspired by such theoretical observation, a simple and new protocol is
developed to determine the location of the process noise with respect to the
static nonlinearity by using an input signal that is periodic, but
nonstationary within one period. In addition, the proposed technique is
promising to detect the type of certain static nonlinearity (e.g., dead-zone,
saturation). Finally, it is validated on a simulated example and a real-life

The method is a novel extension of the regularization methods that have been
developed for impulse response estimates of linear time invariant systems. To
avoid the excessive memory needs in case of long measurements or large number
of estimated parameters, a practical gradient-based estimation method is also
provided, leading to the same numerical results as the proposed Volterra
estimation method. Moreover, the transient effects in the simulated output are
removed by a special regularization method based on the novel ideas of
transient removal for Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems. Combining the proposed
methodologies, the nonparametric Volterra models of the cascaded water tanks
benchmark are presented in this paper. The results for different scenarios
varying from a simple Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model to a 3rd degree
Volterra series with and without transient removal are compared and studied. It
is clear that the obtained models capture the system dynamics when tested on a
validation dataset, and their performance is comparable with the white-box

the LSE to be optimal in the minimum mean-square-error sense. This occurs if
the input signal is characterized by a large signal-to-noise ratio resulting in
the deterministic component of the quantization error dominating the random

that the LSE applied to quantized data does not perform as expected when the

sequence similarities. In the second step, to align remaining unmatched nodes,
the MULTIPLEPERCOLATION algorithm uses network structures and the seed tuples
generated from the first step. We show that, with respect to different

addition, we guarantee the performance of MPGM under certain classes of network

multi-connectivity in millimeter-wave cellular networks. The considered

$\lambda$1549, Al III $\lambda$1860 and Mg II $\lambda$2800. No clear evidence
for the presence of absorption features is found in addition to the already
known, prominent BAL associated to C IV, which supports a high-ionization BAL
classification for APM 08279+5255. We also study the properties of the [O III],
H$\beta$ and Mg II emission lines. We find that [O III] is intrinsically weak
($F_{\rm [OIII]}/F_{\rm H\beta} \lesssim 0.04$), as it is typically found in
luminous quasars with a strongly blueshifted C IV emission line ($\sim$2500 km
s$^{-1}$ for APM 08279+5255). We compute the single-epoch black hole mass based
on Mg II and H$\beta$ broad emission lines, finding $M_{\rm BH} = (2 \div 3)
\times 10^{10}\mu^{-1}$ M$_\odot$, with the magnification factor $\mu$ that can
vary between 4 and 100 according to CO and rest-frame UV-to-mid-IR imaging
respectively. Using a Mg II equivalent width (EW)-to-Eddington ratio relation,
the EW$_{\rm MgII} \sim 27$ \AA\ measured for APM 08279+5255 translates into an
Eddington ratio of $\sim$0.4, which is more consistent with $\mu=4$. This

with recent reverberation-mapping measurements derived from C IV and Si IV.

transportation, market oligopolies, data networks, and various other
applications. An atomic splittable routing game is played on a network where
the edges have traffic-dependent cost functions, and player strategies
correspond to flows in the network. A player can thus split it's traffic
arbitrarily among different paths. While many properties of equilibria in these
games have been studied, efficient algorithms for equilibrium computation are
known for only two cases: if cost functions are affine, or if players are
symmetric. Neither of these conditions is met in most practical applications.
We present two algorithms for routing games with general convex cost functions
on parallel links. The first algorithm is exponential in the number of players,
while the second is exponential in the number of edges; thus if either of these
is small, we get a polynomial-time algorithm. These are the first algorithms
for these games with convex cost functions. Lastly, we show that in general

Recently, a promising unsupervised paradigm termed self-supervised learning has
emerged, which explores inherent supervisory signals implied in massive data
for feature learning via solving auxiliary tasks. However, existing methods in
this regard suffer from two limitations when extended to video classification.
First, they focus only on a single task, whereas ignoring complementarity among
different task-specific features and thus resulting in suboptimal video
representation. Second, high computational and memory cost hinders their
application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a graph-based
distillation framework to address these problems: (1) We propose logits graph
and representation graph to transfer knowledge from multiple self-supervised
tasks, where the former distills classifier-level knowledge by solving a
multi-distribution joint matching problem, and the latter distills internal
feature knowledge from pairwise ensembled representations with tackling the
challenge of heterogeneity among different features; (2) The proposal that
adopts a teacher-student framework can reduce the redundancy of knowledge
learnt from teachers dramatically, leading to a lighter student model that
solves classification task more efficiently. Experimental results on 3 video
datasets validate that our proposal not only helps learn better video
representation but also compress model for faster inference.

audio recordings by the presence of active sound sources. SED is typically
posed as a supervised machine learning problem, requiring strong annotations
for the presence or absence of each sound source at every time instant within
the recording. However, strong annotations of this type are both labor- and
cost-intensive for human annotators to produce, which limits the practical
scalability of SED methods.
  In this work, we treat SED as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem,
where training labels are static over a short excerpt, indicating the presence
or absence of sound sources but not their temporal locality. The models,
however, must still produce temporally dynamic predictions, which must be
aggregated (pooled) when comparing against static labels during training. To
facilitate this aggregation, we develop a family of adaptive pooling
operators---referred to as auto-pool---which smoothly interpolate between
common pooling operators, such as min-, max-, or average-pooling, and
automatically adapt to the characteristics of the sound sources in question. We
evaluate the proposed pooling operators on three datasets, and demonstrate that
in each case, the proposed methods outperform non-adaptive pooling operators
for static prediction, and nearly match the performance of models trained with
strong, dynamic annotations. The proposed method is evaluated in conjunction
with convolutional neural networks, but can be readily applied to any
differentiable model for time-series label prediction.

brighter and more compact than ellipticals. We refer to them as ""Bright,
Compact Bulges"" (BCBs) - they resemble neither classical nor pseudo-bulges and
constitute $\sim12$% of the total bulge population at these redshifts.
Examining free-bulge $+$ disc decomposition sample and elliptical galaxy sample
from Simard et al. (2011), we find that only $\sim0.2$% of the bulges can be
classified as BCBs in the local Universe. Bulge to total ratio $(B/T)$ of disc
galaxies with BCBs is (at $\sim0.4$) a factor of $\sim2$ and $\sim4$ larger

times more massive than classical and pseudo bulges. Although disc galaxies
with BCBs host the most massive and dominant bulge type, their specific star
formation rate is $1.5-2$ times higher than other disc galaxies. This is
contrary to the expectations that a massive compact bulge would lead to lower
star formation rates. We speculate that our BCB host disc galaxies are
descendant of massive, compact and passive elliptical galaxies observed at
higher redshifts. Those high redshift ellipticals lack local counterparts and
possibly evolved by acquiring a compact disc around them. The overall
properties of BCBs supports a picture of galaxy assembly in which younger discs

multi-level semantic inference to boost video feature synthesis, which captures

cells (LCs). To understand the cause and the mechanism of cell transformation
of a LC, we studied the potential sources of cell injuries of LCs and analyzed
how DNA changes are generated and accumulate in LCs. I. The DNA changes that
contribute to cell transformation of a LC can be generated in the LCs in
marrow, thymus, lymph nodes (LNs), and/or lymphoid tissues (LTs). In LNs/LTs,
pathogen-infections may be the main cause for cell injuries of LCs. In marrow
cavity, repeated bone-remodeling during bone-growth and bone-repair, by
producing toxic substances, may be a source of damage to hematopoietic cells,
including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and developing LCs. In thymus, thymic
involution and death of stromal cells may be a damaging factor for the
developing T-cells. II. Point DNA mutation (PDM) and chromosome change (CC) are
the two major types of DNA changes. CCs include numerical CCs (NCCs) and
structural CCs (SCCs). Generation of a PDM/SCC may be a result of Misrepair of
DNA on DNA breaks. Generation of NCC is rather a consequence of dysfunction of
cell division. III. Repeated cell injuries and cell proliferation drive the
accumulation of DNA changes in LCs and HSCs. However, long-term accumulation of
DNA changes occurs mainly in long-living stem cells including HSCs and memory
cells. In conclusion, the DNA changes in LCs are generated and accumulate as a
consequence of repeated cell injuries and repeated cell proliferation; and
three potential sources of cell injuries of LCs may be: repeated
bone-remodeling, long-term thymic involution, and repeated pathogen-infections.

One can identify a specific element among $N$ unsorted elements by a
probability of the order of unity after $k\sim N$ steps of classical
amplification, which is realized by a combination of Grover's unitary operation
and rapid dephasing, in contrast to $k\sim \pi \sqrt{N}/4$ steps in quantum

unbalanced existence probabilities, which is realized by a chosen specific

is crucial in the present analysis of classical amplification. This analysis
illustrates Grover's algorithm in extremely noisy circumstances. A similar
increase from $k\sim \sqrt{N}$ to $k\sim N$ steps due to the loss of quantum
coherence takes place in the {\em analog} model of Farhi and Gutmann where the
entanglement does not play an obvious role. This supports a view that

controversial. While studies, focusing on its mechanistic consequences in
attentional tasks, suggest that synchronization dynamically boosts sensory
processing, others failed to find significant synchronization levels in such
tasks. We attempt to understand both lines of evidence within a coherent
theoretical framework. We conceptualize synchronization as an independent
control parameter to study how the postsynaptic neuron transmits the average
firing activity of a presynaptic population, in the presence of
synchronization. We apply the Berger-Levy theory of energy efficient
information transmission to interpret simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type
postsynaptic neuron model, where we varied the firing rate and synchronization
level in the presynaptic population independently. We find that for a fixed
presynaptic firing rate the simulated postsynaptic interspike interval
distribution depends on the synchronization level and is well-described by a
generalized extreme value distribution. For synchronization levels of 15% to
50%, we find that the optimal distribution of presynaptic firing rate,
maximizing the mutual information per unit cost, is maximized at ~30%
synchronization level. These results suggest that the statistics and energy
efficiency of neuronal communication channels, through which the input rate is
communicated, can be dynamically adapted by the synchronization level.

we test this hypothesis by limiting ourselves to the case of diffuse clouds and
assuming that the average cosmic ray spectrum inside the Galaxy is equal to the
one at the position of the Sun as measured by Voyager 1 and AMS-02. To
calculate the cosmic ray spectrum inside the clouds, we solve the
one-dimensional transport equation taking into account advection, diffusion and
energy losses. While outside the cloud particles diffuse, in its interior they
are assumed to gyrate along magnetic field lines because ion-neutral friction
is effective in damping all the magnetic turbulence. We show that ionization
losses effectively reduce the CR flux in the cloud interior for energies below
$\approx 100$ MeV, especially for electrons, in such a way that the ionization
rate decreases by roughly 2 order of magnitude with respect to the case where
losses are neglected. As a consequence, the predicted ionization rate is more

nonlinearities including hardware-friendly implementations that compressively
acquire entire datasets. This idea is exemplified in a Quantized Compressive

tool to study cosmic rays in different regions of the Galaxy, because the
energy and angular distributions of the photons encode information about the
density and spectral shape of relativistic particles in the entire Milky Way.
  An open problem of fundamental importance is whether cosmic rays in distant
regions of the Milky Way have the same spectral shape observed at the Earth or
not. If the spectral shape of protons and nuclei is equal in all the Galaxy,
the dominant, hadronic component of the diffuse gamma ray flux must have an
angular distribution that, after correcting for absorption effects, is energy
independent.
  To study experimentally the validity of this factorization of the energy and
angular dependence of the diffuse flux it is necessary to compare observations
in a very broad energy range. The extension of the observations to energies
$E_\gamma \simeq 0.1$--10~PeV is of great interest, because it allows the study
of the cosmic ray spectra around the feature known as the ""knee"".
  The absorption probability for photons in this energy range is not
negligible, and distorts the energy and angular distributions of the diffuse
flux, therefore a precise calculation of the absorption effects is necessary
for the interpretation of the data.
  In this work we present predictions of the diffuse gamma ray flux at very
high energy, constructed under different hypothesis for the space dependence of
the cosmic ray energy spectra, and discuss the potential of the observations
for present and future detectors.

speaker-independent multi-speaker speech separation, where time-frequency (T-F)
masking, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and its inverse are
represented as layers within a deep network. Previous approaches, rather than
computing a loss on the reconstructed signal, used a surrogate loss based on
the target STFT magnitudes. This ignores reconstruction error introduced by
phase inconsistency. In our approach, the loss function is directly defined on
the reconstructed signals, which are optimized for best separation. In
addition, we train through unfolded iterations of a phase reconstruction
algorithm, represented as a series of STFT and inverse STFT layers. While mask
values are typically limited to lie between zero and one for approaches using
the mixture phase for reconstruction, this limitation is less relevant if the
estimated magnitudes are to be used together with phase reconstruction. We thus
propose several novel activation functions for the output layer of the T-F

of a binary star by the supermassive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic Centre
(GC). However, HE0437-5439, a $9$ M$_\odot$ B-type main-sequence star moving
with a heliocentric radial velocity of about $720$ km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of
$\sim 60$ kpc, and the recent discovered hypervelocity binary candidate (HVB),
traveling at $\sim 570$ km s$^{-1}$, challenge this standard scenario.
Recently, Fragione & Gualandris (2018) have demonstrated that the tidal breakup
of a triple star leads to an insufficient rate. Observations show that
quadruple stars made up of two binaries orbiting their common center of mass
(the so-called 2+2 quadruples) are $\approx 4\%$ of the stars in the solar
neighborhood. Although rarer than triples, 2+2 quadruple stars may have a role
in ejecting HVBs as due to their larger energy reservoir. We present a
numerical study of 2+2 quadruple disruptions by the MBH in the GC and find that
the production of HVBs has a probability $\lesssim 2-4\%$, which translates
into an ejection rate of $\lesssim 1$ Gyr$^{-1}$, comparable to the triple
disruption scenario. Given the low ejection rate, we suggest that alternative
mechanisms are responsible for the origin of HVBs, as the ejection from the
interaction of a young star cluster with the MBH in the GC and the origin in
the Large Magellanic Cloud.

whether each particular saddle found actually contributes. In principle, this
must be done for each propagation time considered. The method derived here

algebraic geometry, best known as a procedure to enable Quantifier Elimination

exponential in the size of the input, which is often encountered in practice.
It has been observed that for many problems a change in algorithm settings or
problem formulation can cause huge differences in runtime costs, changing
problem instances from intractable to easy. A number of heuristics have been
developed to help with such choices, but the complicated nature of the
geometric relationships involved means these are imperfect and can sometimes
make poor choices. We investigate the use of machine learning (specifically
support vector machines) to make such choices instead.
  Machine learning is the process of fitting a computer model to a complex
function based on properties learned from measured data. In this paper we apply
it in two case studies: the first to select between heuristics for choosing a
CAD variable ordering; the second to identify when a CAD problem instance would
benefit from Groebner Basis preconditioning. These appear to be the first such
applications of machine learning to Symbolic Computation. We demonstrate in
both cases that the machine learned choice outperforms human developed
heuristics.

homeostasis. In this study, we characterize yeast telomere chromatin structure,
phenotypic heritability, and chromatin segregation in both wild-type [MRE11]

of G+T irregular simple sequence repeats. This DNA and a portion of
subtelomeric DNA is embedded in a telosome: a MNase-resistant non-nucleosomal
particle. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows a three to four-fold lower

Telosomes containing the Mre11A470T protein confer a greater resistance to
MNase digestion than wild-type telosomes. The integration of a wild-type MRE11
allele into an ectopic locus in the genome of an mre11A470T mutant and the
introduction of an mre11A470T allele at an ectopic site in a wild-type strain
lead to unexpectedly differing results. In each case, the replicated sister
chromatids inherit telosomes containing only the protein encoded by the genomic
mre11 locus, even in the presence of protein encoded by the opposing ectopic
allele. We hypothesize that the telosome segregates by a conservative
mechanism. These data support a mechanism for the linkage between sister
chromatid replication and maintenance of either identical mutant or identical
wild-type telosomes after replication of sister chromatids. These data suggest
the presence of an active mechanism for chromatin segregation in yeast.

generative steganography by sampling (GSS) is proposed. Unlike in traditional
modification-based steganography, in our method the stego image is directly
sampled by a powerful generator: no explicit cover is used. Both parties share
a secret key used for message embedding and extraction. The Jensen-Shannon
divergence is introduced as a new criterion for evaluating the security of
generative steganography. Based on these principles, we propose a simple
practical generative steganography method that uses semantic image inpainting.
The message is written in advance to an uncorrupted region that needs to be
retained in the corrupted image. Then, the corrupted image with the secret
message is fed into a Generator trained by a generative adversarial network
(GAN) for semantic completion. Message loss and prior loss terms are proposed
for penalizing message extraction error and unrealistic stego image. In our
design, we first train a generator whose training target is the generation of
new data samples from the same distribution as that of existing training data.
Next, for the trained generator, backpropagation to the message and prior loss
are introduced to optimize the coding of the input noise data for the
generator. The presented experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed
framework based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the

load measurements, are often specific to a particular study design, and do not
account for complex, temporal variation. To address this issue, we propose a
set of four unambiguous computable characteristics (features) of time-varying
HIV viral load patterns, along with a novel centroid-based classification
algorithm, which we use to classify a population of 1,576 HIV positive clinic
patients into one of five different viral load patterns (clusters) often found
in the literature: durably suppressed viral load (DSVL), sustained low viral
load (SLVL), sustained high viral load (SHVL), high viral load suppression
(HVLS), and rebounding viral load (RVL). The centroid algorithm summarizes
these clusters in terms of their centroids and radii. We show that this allows
new viral load patterns to be assigned pattern membership based on the distance
from the centroid relative to its radius, which we term radial normalization
classification. This method has the benefit of providing an objective and
quantitative method to assign viral load pattern membership with a concise and
interpretable model that aids clinical decision making. This method also
facilitates meta-analyses by providing computably distinct HIV categories.
Finally we propose that this novel centroid algorithm could also be useful in
the areas of cluster comparison for outcomes research and data reduction in
machine learning.

in the framework of the Randall Sundrum type-II braneworld model. We consider
the original and generalized Chaplygin gas model in the presence of monomial
potential. The inflationary spectrum perturbation parameters are reformulated
and evaluated in the high-energy limit and we found that they depend on several
parameters. We also showed that these perturbation parameters are widely
compatible with the recent Planck data for a particular choice of the
parameters space of the model. A suitable observational central value of
$n_{s}\simeq $ $0.965$ is also obtained in the case of original and generalized
Chaplygin gas.

  to linear alternatives",,"Journal of Mathematical Biology, 1-25 (2020)",,,"q-bio.PE math.RA math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A matrix Lie algebra is a linear space of matrices closed under the operation
$ [A, B] = AB-BA $. The ""Lie closure"" of a set of matrices is the smallest
matrix Lie algebra which contains the set. In the context of Markov chain
theory, if a set of rate matrices form a Lie algebra, their corresponding
Markov matrices are closed under matrix multiplication; this has been found to
be a useful property in phylogenetics. Inspired by previous research involving
Lie closures of DNA models, it was hypothesised that finding the Lie closure of
a codon model could help to solve the problem of mis-estimation of the
non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio, $ \omega $. We propose two different
methods of finding a linear space from a model: the first is the \emph{linear
closure} which is the smallest linear space which contains the model, and the
second is the \emph{linear version} which changes multiplicative constraints in
the model to additive ones. For each of these linear spaces we then find the
Lie closures of them. Under both methods, it was found that closed codon models
would require thousands of parameters, and that any partial solution to this
problem that was of a reasonable size violated stochasticity. Investigation of
toy models indicated that finding the Lie closure of matrix linear spaces which
deviated only slightly from a simple model resulted in a Lie closure that was
close to having the maximum number of parameters possible. Given that Lie
closures are not practical, we propose further consideration of the two
variants of linearly closed models.

perspective that conversational interaction serves as a natural interface both

for efficient search and machine learning on large datasets. Given two $D$-dim
data vectors $u$, $v\in\mathbb{R}^D$, one can generate $x = \sum_{i=1}^D u_i
r_i$, and $y = \sum_{i=1}^D v_i r_i$, where $r_i\sim N(0,1)$ iid. The
""collision probability"" is ${Pr}\left(sgn(x)=sgn(y)\right) =
1-\frac{\cos^{-1}\rho}{\pi}$, where $\rho = \rho(u,v)$ is the cosine
similarity.
  We develop ""sign-full"" random projections by estimating $\rho$ from (e.g.,)
the expectation $E(sgn(x)y)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \rho$, which can be further
substantially improved by normalizing $y$. For nonnegative data, we recommend
an interesting estimator based on $E\left(y_- 1_{x\geq 0} + y_+ 1_{x<0}\right)$
and its normalized version. The recommended estimator almost matches the
accuracy of the (computationally expensive) maximum likelihood estimator. At
high similarity ($\rho\rightarrow1$), the asymptotic variance of recommended
estimator is only $\frac{4}{3\pi} \approx 0.4$ of the estimator for sign-sign
projections. At small $k$ and high similarity, the improvement would be even
much more substantial.

Recent studies have reported that water purifications systems are responsible

investigated the instantaneous effects of water-supply systems in pre-war
Japan, little is known about the chain effects of these systems. By analyzing
city-level cause-specific mortality data from 1922-1940, we find that a decline
in typhoid deaths by one per 1,000 people decreased the risk of death due to
non-waterborne diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia by 0.742-2.942 per

could have resulted in the relatively rapid decline in the mortality rate in
early twentieth-century Japan.
