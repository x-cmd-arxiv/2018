bilayer graphene system [Nature Nanotechnol. 11, 1060 (2016)], we
systematically studied the influence of a magnetic field on ZLMs and
demonstrated the physical origin of the enhanced robustness by employing
nonequilibrium Green's functions and the Landauer-Buttiker formula. We found
that a perpendicular magnetic field can separate the wavefunctions of the
counter-propagating kink states into opposite directions. Specifically, the
separation vanishes at the charge neutrality point. The separation increases as
the Fermi level deviates from the charge neutrality point and can reach a
magnitude comparable to the wavefunction spread at a moderate field strength.
Such spatial separation of oppositely propagating ZLMs effectively suppresses
backscattering. Moreover, the presence of a magnetic field enlarges the bulk
gap and suppresses the bound states, thereby further reducing the scattering.
These mechanisms effectively increase the mean free paths of the ZLMs to
approximately 1 micron in the presence of a disorder.

mixed time-series signals into a sum of spatiotemporal modes, with the
constraint that the temporal components are intrinsic mode functions (IMF's).
The key motivation is that IMF's allow the computation of meaningful Hilbert
transforms of non-stationary data, from which instantaneous time-frequency
representations may be derived. Our spatiotemporal intrinsic mode decomposition
(STIMD) method leverages spatial correlations to generalize the extraction of
IMF's from one-dimensional signals, commonly performed using the empirical mode
decomposition (EMD), to multi-dimensional signals. Further, this data-driven
method enables future-state prediction. We demonstrate STIMD on several
synthetic examples, comparing it to common matrix factorization techniques,
namely singular value decomposition (SVD), independent component analysis
(ICA), and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). We show that STIMD outperforms
these methods at reconstruction and extracting interpretable modes. Next, we
apply STIMD to analyze two real-world datasets, gravitational wave data and
neural recordings from the rodent hippocampus.

robust under composition and mixing, features that largely improve the
effectiveness of quantum speed limits for open evolution of mixed states. We

success in many applications like speech recognition and neural machine
translation. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is one of the most popular RNN units
in deep learning applications. LSTM transforms the input and the previous
hidden states to the next states with the affine transformation, multiplication
operations and a nonlinear activation function, which makes a good data
representation for a given task. The affine transformation includes rotation
and reflection, which change the semantic or syntactic information of
dimensions in the hidden states. However, considering that a model interprets
the output sequence of LSTM over the whole input sequence, the dimensions of
the states need to keep the same type of semantic or syntactic information
regardless of the location in the sequence. In this paper, we propose a simple
variant of the LSTM unit, persistent recurrent unit (PRU), where each dimension
of hidden states keeps persistent information across time, so that the space
keeps the same meaning over the whole sequence. In addition, to improve the
nonlinear transformation power, we add a feedforward layer in the PRU
structure. In the experiment, we evaluate our proposed methods with three
different tasks, and the results confirm that our methods have better
performance than the conventional LSTM.

strong radiative feedback on the stars' natal environments from their high
luminosities ($10^4 \sim 10^6 L_\odot$). Given that massive stars contract to
main-sequence-like radii before accretion finishes, one form this feedback
takes is UV line-acceleration, resulting in outflows much like those expected
from main-sequence massive stars. As shown by the prior papers in this series,
in addition to driving stellar winds, such line forces also ablate the surface
layers off of circumstellar discs within a few stellar radii of the stellar
photosphere. This removal of material from an accretion disc in turn results in
a decreased accretion rate onto the forming star. Quantifying this, however,
requires accounting for the continuum optical depth of the disc along the
non-radial rays required for the three-dimensional line-acceleration
prescription used in this paper series. We introduce the ""thin disc
approximation"", allowing these continuum optical depths arising from an
optically thick but geometrically thin disc to be dynamically treated in the
context of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Using this approximation in
full dynamical simulations, we show that such continuum optical depth effects
only reduce the disc ablation by 30 percent or less relative to previous

pure-slow and pure-fast subsystems. Locally optimal decentralized tracking
sub-controllers are synthesized respectively to asymptotically synchronize each
subsystem of follower. A composite control protocol is proposed to synchronize
the original dynamics of each follower with the leader's dynamics. Both
analogous and digital flight control systems for aircraft formation flying are
utilized to verify the effectiveness of the control schemes.

enough so that each mode adiabatically follows the decrease of the mean
density. The theory is valid for any loss process whose rate is proportional to
the $j$th power of the density, but otherwise spatially uniform. We cover both
homogeneous gases and systems confined in a smooth potential. For a
low-dimensional gas, we can take into account the modified equation of state
due to the broadening of the cloud width along the tightly confined directions,
which occurs for large interactions. We find that at large times, the
temperature decreases proportionally to the energy scale $mc^2$, where $m$ is
the mass of the particles and $c$ the sound velocity. We compute the asymptotic
ratio of these two quantities for different limiting cases: a homogeneous gas
in any dimension and a one-dimensional gas in a harmonic trap.

of bits themselves generated by QRNGs, despite the absence of empirical tests
supporting this. Nonetheless, one may expect sequences of bits generated by
QRNGs to have properties that pseudo-random sequences do not; indeed,
pseudo-random sequences are necessarily computable, a highly nontypical
property of sequences.
  In this paper, we discuss the differences between QRNGs and PRNGs and the
challenges involved in certifying the quality of QRNGs theoretically and
testing their output experimentally. While QRNGs are often tested with standard
suites of statistical tests, such tests are designed for PRNGs and only verify
statistical properties of a QRNG, but are insensitive to many supposed
advantages of QRNGs. We discuss the ability to test the incomputability and
algorithmic complexity of QRNGs. While such properties cannot be directly
verified with certainty, we show how one can construct indirect tests that may
provide evidence for the incomputability of QRNGs. We use these tests to
compare various PRNGs to a QRNG, based on superconducting transmon qutrits and
certified by the Kochen-Specker Theorem, to see whether such evidence can be
found in practice.
  While our tests fail to observe a strong advantage of the quantum random
sequences due to algorithmic properties, the results are nonetheless
informative: some of the test results are ambiguous and require further study,
while others highlight difficulties that can guide the development of future
tests of algorithmic randomness and incomputability.

not always the case. In particular, we show that for Young elections for
dichotomous preferences the winner problem is easy, while determining the score

is unusual. The easiness of the winner problem for dichotomous Young crucially
uses the fact that dichotomous preferences guarantee the transitivity of the

single-peaked preferences, the most well-studied domain restriction that
guarantees the transitivity of the majority relation. We show that for the

obstacle is investigated through a generalized version of the standard multi
filaments Brownian Ratchet model in which the (de)polymerizing filaments are
treated not as rigid rods but as semi-flexible discrete wormlike chains with a
realistic value of the persistence length.
  By stochastic dynamic simulations we study the relaxation of a bundle of
$N_f$ filaments with staggered seed arrangement against a harmonic trap load in
supercritical conditions. Thanks to the time scale separation between the wall
motion and the filament size relaxation, mimiking realistic conditions, this
set-up allows us to extract a full load-velocity curve from a single experiment
over the trap force/size range explored. We observe a systematic evolution of
steady non-equilibrium states over three regimes of bundle lengths $L$. A first
threshold length $\Lambda$ marks the transition between the rigid dynamic
regime ($L<\Lambda$), characterized by the usual rigid filament load-velocity
relationship $V(F)$, and the flexible dynamic regime ($L>\Lambda$), where the
velocity $V(F,L)$ is an increasing function of the bundle length $L$ at fixed
load $F$, the enhancement being the result of an improved level of work sharing
among the filaments induced by flexibility. A second critical length
corresponds to the beginning of an unstable regime characterized by a high
probability to develop escaping filaments which start growing laterally and
thus do not participate anymore to the generation of the polymerization force.
This phenomenon prevents the bundle from reaching at this critical length the
limit behavior corresponding to Perfect Load Sharing.

its integrity, is considered. We show that elastic interactions keeping the
nucleus in the same quantum state lead to a quadratic enhancement of the
corresponding cross-section in terms of the number of nucleons. Meanwhile, the
cross-section of inelastic processes in which the quantum state of the nucleus
is changed, essentially has a linear dependence on the number of nucleons.
These two classes of processes are referred to as coherent and incoherent,
respectively. The coherent and incoherent cross-sections are driven by factors
$|F_{p/n}|^2$ and $(1-|F_{p/n}|^2)$, where $|F_{p/n}|^2$ is a proton/neutron
form-factor of the nucleus, averaged over its initial states. The coherent
cross-section formula used in the literature is revised and corrections
depending on kinematics are estimated. As an illustration of the importance of
the incoherent channel we considered three experimental setups with different
nuclei. Experiments attempting to measure coherent neutrino scattering by
solely detecting the recoiling nucleus, as is typical, might be including an
incoherent background that is indistinguishable from the signal if the
excitation gamma eludes its detection. However, as is shown here, the
incoherent component can be measured directly by searching for photons released
by the excited nuclei inherent to the incoherent channel. For a beam experiment
these gammas should be correlated in time with the beam, and their higher
energies make the corresponding signal easily detectable at a rate governed by
the ratio of incoherent to coherent cross-sections. The detection of signals
due to the nuclear recoil and excitation gammas provides a more sensitive
instrument in studies of nuclear structure and possible signs of new physics.

inflaton induces a tachyonic instability for one of the two helicities of the

to the production of chiral fermions by deforming their Fermi sphere into
discrete Landau levels. The population of the lowest Landau level leads to a
chiral asymmetry as inferred from the chiral anomaly, while the higher levels
are populated symmetrically through pair production. From the backreaction of
the fermions on the gauge field production we derive a conservative but
stringent upper bound on the magnitude of the gauge fields. Consequently, we
find that the scalar perturbations sourced by these helical gauge fields,
responsible for enhanced structure formation on small scales, get reduced
significantly. We also discuss the fate of the primordial chiral asymmetry and
of the helical gauge fields after inflation, and show that the instability in
the chiral plasma tends to erase these primordial asymmetries. This result may
impact scenarios where the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is connected to

wireless medium is paramount. Although wireless channel characteristics and
dynamics have been extensively studied, it is important to revisit these
concepts in the context of the strict demands of low latency and
ultra-reliability. In this paper, we bring a modeling approach from robust
control to wireless communication -- the wireless channel characteristics are
given a nominal model around which we allow for some quantified uncertainty. We
propose certain key ""directions"" along which to bound model uncertainty that
are relevant to URLLC. For the nominal model, we take an in-depth look at
wireless channel characteristics such as spatial and temporal correlations
based on Jakes' model. Contrary to what has been claimed in the literature, we
find that standard Rayleigh fading processes are not bandlimited. This has
significant implications on the predictability of channels. We also find that
under reasonable conditions the spatial correlation of channels provide a
fading distribution that is not too far off from an independent spatial fading
model. Additionally, we look at the impact of these channel models on
cooperative communication based systems. We find that while
spatial-diversity-based techniques are necessary to combat the adverse effects
of fading, time-diversity-based techniques are necessary to be robust against
unmodeled errors. Robust URLLC systems need to operate with both an SNR margin
and a time/repetition margin.

subtle interplay of quantum coherence and environmental noise. Probing the
noise-induced current can be detrimental to the tunneling-induced current and
vice versa. We derive a general theory for the probability current in quantum
systems arbitrarily interacting with their environment that overcomes this
difficulty. We show that the current can be experimentally measured by
performing a sequence of weak and standard quantum measurements. We exemplify
our theory by analyzing a simple Smoluchowski-Feynman-type ratchet consisting
of two particles, operating deep in the quantum regime. Fully incorporating
both thermal and quantum effects, the current generated in the model can be
used to detect the onset of ""genuine quantumness"" in the form of quantum
contextuality. The model can also be used to generate steady-state entanglement
in the presence of arbitrarily hot environment.

this work, we establish a new link between concepts of quantum information
theory and condensed matter physics by presenting a unified understanding of
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order protected by subsystem symmetries
and its relation to measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). The key
unifying ingredient is the concept of quantum cellular automata (QCA) which we
use to define subsystem symmetries acting on rigid lower-dimensional lines or
fractals on a 2D lattice. Notably, both types of symmetries are treated
equivalently in our framework. We show that states within a non-trivial SPT
phase protected by these symmetries are indicated by the presence of the same
QCA in a tensor network representation of the state, thereby characterizing the
structure of entanglement that is uniformly present throughout these phases. By
also formulating schemes of MBQC based on these QCA, we are able to prove that
most of the phases we construct are computationally universal phases of matter,
in which every state is a resource for universal MBQC. Interestingly, our
approach allows us to construct computational phases which have practical
advantages over previous examples, including a computational speedup. The
significance of the approach stems from constructing novel computationally
universal phases of matter and showcasing the power of tensor networks and
quantum information theory in classifying subsystem SPT order.

amplitude function of a quantum state is computed by a neural network. The
resulting multipartite entanglement structure captured by this ansatz has
proven rich enough to describe the ground states and unitary dynamics of
various physical systems of interest. In the present paper, we initiate the
study of neural network states in quantum information-processing tasks. We
demonstrate that neural network states are capable of efficiently representing
quantum codes for quantum information transmission and quantum error
correction, supplying further evidence for the usefulness of neural network
states to describe multipartite entanglement. In particular, we show the
following main results: a) Neural network states yield quantum codes with a
high coherent information for two important quantum channels, the generalized
amplitude damping channel and the dephrasure channel. These codes outperform
all other known codes for these channels, and cannot be found using a direct
parametrization of the quantum state. b) For the depolarizing channel, the
neural network state ansatz reliably finds the best known codes given by
repetition codes. c) Neural network states can be used to represent absolutely
maximally entangled states, a special type of quantum error-correcting codes.
In all three cases, the neural network state ansatz provides an efficient and
versatile means as a variational parametrization of these highly entangled
states.

the strong CP problem by the Nelson-Barr relaxion: the relaxion field is
identified with the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of an abelian symmetry with no
QCD anomaly. The Nelson-Barr sector generates the ""rolling"" potential and the
relaxion vacuum expectation value at the stopping point is mapped to the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase. An abelian symmetry accounts for the Standard
Model's mass hierarchies and flavor textures through the Froggatt-Nielsen
mechanism. We show how the ""backreaction"" potential of the relaxion can be
induced by a sterile neutrino sector, without any extra state with electroweak
quantum numbers. The same construction successfully explains neutrino masses
and mixings. The only light field in our construction is the relaxion, which we
call the hierarchion because it is essentially linked to our construct that
accounts for all the Standard Model hierarchies. Given its interplay with
flavor symmetries, the hierarchion can be probed in flavor-violating decays of
the Standard Model fermions, motivating a further experimental effort in
looking for new physics in rare decays of leptons and mesons.

strong MgII 2796 absorption (with equivalent width W_2796>0.1 Ang) with a
near-unity covering fraction. To characterize the spatial coherence of this
absorption, we analyze the W_2796 distribution in the CGM of 27 star-forming
galaxies detected in deep spectroscopy of bright background (b/g) galaxies
first presented in Rubin et al. (2018). The sample foreground (f/g) systems
have redshifts 0.35<z<0.8 and stellar masses 9.1<log M_*/M_sun<11.1, and the
b/g galaxies provide spatially-extended probes with half-light radii 1.0
kpc<R_eff<7.9 kpc at projected distances R_perp<50 kpc. Our analysis also draws
on literature W_2796 values measured in b/g QSO spectroscopy probing the halos
of f/g galaxies with a similar range in M_* at z ~ 0.25. By making the
assumptions that (1) samples of like galaxies exhibit similar circumgalactic
W_2796 distributions; and that (2) the quantity log W_2796 has a Gaussian
distribution with a dispersion that is constant with M_* and R_perp, we use
this QSO-galaxy pair sample to construct a model for the log W_2796
distribution in the CGM. We then demonstrate the dependence of this
distribution on the ratio of the surface area of the b/g probe to the projected
absorber surface area (x_A=A_G/A_A), finding that distributions which assume
x_A>=15 are statistically inconsistent with that observed toward our b/g
galaxies at a 95% confidence level. This limit, in combination with the b/g
galaxy sizes, requires that the length scale over which W_2796 does not vary
(the ""coherence scale"" of MgII absorption) is l_A>1.9 kpc. This novel
constraint on the morphology of cool, photoionized structures in the inner CGM
suggests that either these structures each extend over kiloparsec scales, or
that the numbers and velocity dispersion of these structures are spatially
correlated over the same scales.

debris disc under the influence of a system of two coplanar planets interior to
the disc, showing that the secular resonances of the system can produce a
depleted region in the disc by exciting the eccentricities of planetesimals.
Using Laplace-Lagrange theory, we consider how the two exterior secular
resonance locations, time-scales and widths depend on the masses, semi-major
axes and eccentricities of the planets. In particular, we find that unless the
resonances are very close to each other, one of them is very narrow and
therefore unimportant for determining the observable structure of the disc. We
apply these considerations to the debris disc of HD 107146, identifying
combinations of the parameters of a possible unobserved two-planet system that
could configure the secular resonances appropriately to reproduce the depletion
observed in the disc. By performing N-body simulations of such systems, we find
that planetesimal eccentricities do indeed become large near the theoretical
secular resonance locations. The N-body output is post-processed to set the
initial surface density profile of the disc, and to include the possible
effects of collisional depletion. We find that it is possible to obtain a
double-ringed disc in these simulations but not an axisymmetric one, with the
inner ring having an offset whose magnitude depends on the eccentricities of
the planets, and the outer ring showing spiral structure.

architectures in an end-to-end fashion. DiffPool learns a differentiable soft
cluster assignment for nodes at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a
set of clusters, which then form the coarsened input for the next GNN layer.
Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN methods with DiffPool
yields an average improvement of 5-10% accuracy on graph classification
benchmarks, compared to all existing pooling approaches, achieving a new

between systems and can be traced back to the 1957 Introduction to Cybernetics
by Ross Ashby. We argue that complexity can be expressed in terms of crucial
events, which are generated by the processes of spontaneous self-organization.
Complex processes, ranging from biological to sociological, must satisfy the
homeodynamic condition and host crucial events that have recently been shown to
drive the information transport between complex systems. We adopt a
phenomenological approach, based on the subordination to periodicity that makes
it possible to combine homeodynamics and self-organization induced crucial
events. The complexity of crucial events is defined by the waiting-time
probability density function (PDF) of the intervals between consecutive crucial
events, which have an inverse power law (IPL) PDF $\psi (\tau )\propto 1/(\tau
)^{\mu }$ with $1<\mu <3$. We show that the action of crucial events has an
effect compatible with the shared notion of complexity-induced entropy
reduction, while making the synchronization between systems sharing the same
complexity different from chaos synchronization. We establish the coupling
between two temporally complex systems using a phenomenological approach
inspired by models of swarm cognition and prove that complexity matching,
namely sharing the same IPL index $\mu $, facilitates the transport of
information, generating perfect synchronization. This new form of complexity
matching is expected to contribute significantly to progress in understanding
and improving biofeedback therapies.

reproducing these views often comes at the cost of increased surgical time and
radiation dose to both patient and staff. This work proposes a marker-free

equipped with a head-mounted display capable of recording desired C-arm poses
in 3D via an integrated infrared sensor. For C-arm repositioning to a
particular target view, the recorded C-arm pose is restored as a virtual object
and visualized in an AR environment, serving as a perceptual reference for the
technician. We conduct experiments in a setting simulating orthopedic trauma
surgery. Our proof-of-principle findings indicate that the proposed system can
decrease the 2.76 X-ray images required per desired view down to zero,
suggesting substantial reductions of radiation dose during C-arm repositioning.
The proposed AR solution is a first step towards facilitating communication
between the surgeon and the surgical staff, improving the quality of surgical
image acquisition, and enabling context-aware guidance for surgery rooms of the
future. The concept of technician-in-the-loop design will become relevant to
various interventions considering the expected advancements of sensing and

respective limits of sparse versus dense problems, as well as high-degeneracy

gas has led to the {\it cooling flow problem} at the cores of clusters of
galaxies. A variety of models have been proposed to model the observed X-ray
spectra and resolve the cooling flow problem, which involves heating the cold
gas through different mechanisms. As a result, realistic models of X-ray
spectra of galaxy clusters need to involve both heating {\it and} cooling
mechanisms. In this paper, we argue that the heating time-scale is set by the
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent viscous heating for the Intracluster
plasma, parametrised by the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter, $\alpha$.
Using a cooling+heating flow model, we show that a value of $\alpha\simeq 0.05$
(with 10\% scatter) provides improved fits to the X-ray spectra of cooling
flow, while at the same time, predicting reasonable cooling efficiency,
$\epsilon_{cool} = 0.33^{+0.63}_{-0.15}$. Our inferred values for $\alpha$
based on X-ray spectra are also in line with direct measurements of turbulent
pressure in simulations and observations of galaxy clusters. This simple
picture unifies astrophysical accretion, as a balance of MHD turbulent heating
and cooling, across more than 16 orders of magnitudes in scale, from neutron
stars to galaxy clusters.

PhD thesis",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Familiar formulations of classical and quantum mechanics are shown to follow
from a general theory of mechanics based on pure states with an intrinsic
probability structure. This theory is developed to the stage where theorems
from quantum logic enable expression of the state geometry in Hilbert space.
Quantum and classical mechanics are then elaborated and applied to subsystems
and the measurement process. Consideration is also given to space-time geometry
and the constraints this places on the dynamics. Physics and Mathematics, it is
argued, are growing apart; the inadequate treatment of approximations in
general and localisation in quantum mechanics in particular are seen as
contributing factors. In the description of systems, the link between
localisation and lack of knowledge shows that quantum mechanics should reflect
the domain of applicability. Restricting the class of states provides a means
of achieving this goal. Localisation is then shown to have a mathematical
expression in terms of compactness, which in turn is applied to yield a
topological theory of bound and scattering states. Finally, the thesis
questions the validity of classical limits and quantisations in intertheoretic
reduction, and demonstrates that a widely accepted classical limit does not
constitute a proof of reduction. It proposes a procedure for determining
whether classical and quantum mechanics are weakly equivalent over a domain of
applicability, and concludes that, in this restricted sense, classical
mechanics reduces to quantum mechanics.

well known Frenet frame. Later, we show that the curvature function is a lower
bound for the scalar angular velocity of any other orthonormal moving frame,
from which one defines Rotation Minimizing (RM) frames as the ones that achieve
this minimum. Remarkably, RM frames are ideal to study spherical curves and
allow us to characterize them through a simple linear equation. We also apply
these ideas to curves that lie on level surfaces, by reinterpreting the problem
in the context of a metric induced by a Hessian, which may fail to be positive
or non-degenerate and naturally leads us to a Lorentz-Minkowski
$\mathbb{E}_1^3$ or isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$ space. Here we develop a
systematic approach to construct RM frames and characterize spherical curves in
$\mathbb{E}_1^3$ and $\mathbb{I}^3$ and furnish a criterion for a curve to lie
on a level surface. Finally, we extend these tools to characterize geodesic
spherical curves in hyperbolic and spherical spaces. In the 2nd part we apply
the previous ideas in the quantum dynamics of a constrained particle. After
describing the confining potential formalism, from which emerges a
geometry-induced potential (GIP), we devote our attention to tubular surfaces
to model curved nanotubes. The use of RM frames offers a simpler description
for the constrained dynamics and allows us to show that the torsion of the
centerline of a tube gives rise to a geometric phase. Later, we study the
problem of prescribed GIP for surfaces. Here we explore the GIP for surfaces
invariant by a 1-parameter group of isometries, i.e., cylindrical, revolution,

methodology first constructs a library of candidate probing vectors by sampling
over the feasible set of inverter injections. Leveraging a linearized grid
model and a robust approach, the candidate probing vectors violating voltage
constraints for any anticipated load value are subsequently rejected. Among the
qualified candidates, the design finally identifies the probing vectors

constants and populations of reactant and product bimolecular geometric
orientations for the reactions were obtained by using density functional theory
for the energies, transition state theory for the rates and matrix
exponentiation as well as the hybrid tau-leaping algorithm for the population
dynamics. The role of including the solvent explicitly versus implicitly was
also investigated. We found that adding water or hydrogen sulfide molecules
explicitly lowers the activation energy barrier and leads to a more efficient
reaction pathway. In particular, hydrogen sulfide was a better proton donor.
Further, when adding the solvent explicitly a synchronous reaction mechanism
was observed while a concerted reaction mechanism was seen when using an
implicit solvent model. Finally, we studied the role of including more than one
reactant and product bimolecular orientation geometry in the dynamics.
Including all pathways, reactant to reactant, product to product, reactant to
product and product to reactant reduced the reaction half-time by two orders of
magnitude and was therefore determined to be fundamental for an accurate
description of the dynamics. Overall, we found that most reactions which
involve formalcyanohydrin occur more rapidly or at the same speed as reactions
which involve acetone cyanohydrin at room temperature.

over the whole dimming event, including the dimming between the dips and the
brightening event (the `blip') which occurs after the dips. We find that a
single wavelength dependence does not fit the entire light curve and the
dimming occurring between the dips is non-gray and varies in time. Because of
the non-gray dimming between the dips, we measure the wavelength dependence of
the dips separately and without the extra depth from this dimming. Such
measurements yield a different estimate of the wavelength dependence the
wavelength dependence of the dips but remains consistent with the previous
measurement except for Elsie (the first dip), which is surrounded by dimming
with strong wavelength dependence. We find the range of the wavelength

optically-thin dust with an average radius of $r<1\,\mu$m and the dust causing

evaders performing random walks on digraphs. There exist several bounds on the
expected meeting time between random walkers on graphs in the literature,
however, closed-form expressions are limited in scope. By utilizing the notion
that multiple random walks on a common graph can be understood as a single
random walk on the Kronecker product graph, we are able to provide the first
analytic expression for the meeting time in terms of the transition matrices of
the random walkers when modeled by either discrete-time Markov chains or
continuous-time Markov chains. We further extend the results to the case of
multiple pursuers and multiple evaders performing independent random walks. We
present various sufficient conditions for pairs (or tuples) of transition
matrices that satisfy certain conditions on the absorbing classes for which
finite meeting times are guaranteed to exist.

the breaking of the chiral symmetry. Quantizing the energy function for a given

In addition an unexpectedly large azimuthal anisotropy was observed for the

challenges to the theoretical understanding of the coupling between heavy
quarks and the quark-gluon plasma produced in these collisions. Transport
models for the evolution of heavy quarks in a QCD medium offer the opportunity
to study these effects - two of the most successful approaches are based on the
linearized Boltzmann transport equation and the Langevin equation. In this
work, we develop a hybrid transport model that combines the strengths of both

matrix-elements calculated in perturbative QCD, while between these discrete
hard scatterings they evolve using a Langevin equation with empirical transport
coefficients to capture the non-perturbative soft part of the interaction. With

$f\left(R,\nabla_{\mu}R,\nabla_{\mu_{1}}\nabla_{\mu_{2}}R,\dots,\nabla_{\mu_{1}}\dots\nabla_{\mu_{n}}R\right)$
theories of gravity, are equivalent to scalar-multitensorial theories in the
Jordan frame. In particular, in the metric and Palatini formalisms, this
scalar-multitensorial equivalent scenario shows a structure that resembles that
of the Brans-Dicke theories with a kinetic term for the scalar field with
$\omega_{0}=0$ or $\omega_{0}=-3/2$, respectively. In the present work, the
aforementioned analysis is extended to the Einstein frame. The conformal
transformation of the metric characterizing the transformation from Jordan's to
Einstein's frame is responsible for decoupling the scalar field from the scalar
curvature and also for introducing a usual kinetic term for the scalar field in
the metric formalism. In the Palatini approach, this kinetic term is absent in
the action. Concerning the other tensorial auxiliary fields, they appear in the
theory through a generalized potential. As an example, the analysis of an
extension of the Starobinsky model (with an extra term proportional to
$\nabla_{\mu}R\nabla^{\mu}R$) is performed and the fluid representation for the
energy-momentum tensor is considered. In the metric formalism, the presence of
the extra term causes the fluid to be an imperfect fluid with a heat flux
contribution; on the other hand, in the Palatini formalism the effective
energy-momentum tensor for the extended Starobinsky gravity is that of a
perfect fluid type. Finally, it is also shown that the extra term in the
Palatini formalism represents a dynamical field which is able to generate an
inflationary regime without a graceful exit.

  Our main result is a generalization of the Aronszajn--Donoghue theorem about
the mutual singularity of the singular parts of the spectrum for rank one
perturbations to the case of finite rank perturbations. Simple direct sum type
examples indicate that an exact generalization is not possible. However, in
this paper we introduce the notion of \emph{vector mutual singularity} for the
matrix-valued measures and show that if we use this notion, the mutual
singularity still holds for the finite rank perturbations.
  As for the scalar spectral measures and the classical mutual singularity, we
show that the singular parts are mutually singular for almost all
perturbations. One of the ways to prove that is to use a generalization of the
Aleksandrov's spectral averaging to the matrix-valued measures, which is also
one of the main results of this paper.
  Finally, the spectral representation of the perturbed operator is obtained.
The matrix Muckenhoupt $A_2$ condition appears naturally there, and it plays an
important role in establishing the vector mutual singularity of the spectral
measures.

Casimir force, which we obtain based on the generalized force exerted by the
order parameter field on the confining walls. We identify various asymptotic
regimes concerning the time evolution of the order parameter and the critical
Casimir force and we provide, within our approach, exact expressions of the

requiring twice the qubit resources ($2n$ copies of $| \psi \rangle$) but with
a depth that is independent of both $k$ and $n$. Surprisingly this depth is
only two gates. Our numerical simulations show that this short depth leads to
an increased robustness to noise.

Server. The indexing was applied to the 2MASS All-Sky Catalog and to the Hubble
Source Catalog, which approximate the diversity of catalogs common in
astronomy. On each server, the study compared indexing performance by
submitting 1 million queries at each index level with random sky positions and
random cone search radius, which was computed on a logarithmic scale between 1
arcsec and 1 degree, and measuring the time to complete the query and write the
output. These simulated queries, intended to model realistic use patterns, were
run in a uniform way on many combinations of indexing method and indexing
depth. The query times in all simulations are strongly I/O-bound and are linear
with number of records returned for large numbers of sources. There are,
however, considerable differences between simulations, which reveal that
hardware I/O throughput is a more important factor in managing the performance
of a DBMS than the choice of indexing scheme. The choice of index itself is
relatively unimportant: for comparable index levels, the performance is
consistent within the scatter of the timings. At small index levels (large
cells; e.g. level 4; cell size 3.7 deg), there is large scatter in the timings
because of wide variations in the number of sources found in the cells. At
larger index levels, performance improves and scatter decreases, but the
improvement at level 8 (14 arcmin) and higher is masked to some extent in the
timing scatter caused by the range of query sizes. At very high levels (20;
0.0004 arsec), the granularity of the cells becomes so high that a large number
of extraneous empty cells begin to degrade performance.

boundary can forbid close encounters between the two planets for infinite time.
A system is said Hill stable if it verifies this topological condition. Hill
stability is widely used in the study of extra solar planets dynamics. However
people often use the coplanar and circular orbits approximation.
  In this paper, we explain how the Hill stability can be understood in the
framework of Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD). In the secular approximation, the
AMD allows to discriminate between a priori stable systems and systems for
which a more in depth dynamical analysis is required. We show that the general
Hill stability criterion can be expressed as a function of only the semi major
axes, the masses and the total AMD of the system. The proposed criterion is
only expanded in the planets-to-star mass ratio $\epsilon$ and not in the
semi-major axis ratio, in eccentricities nor in the mutual inclination.
Moreover the expansion in $\epsilon$ remains excellent up to values of about
$10^{-3}$ even for two planets with very different mass values.
  We performed numerical simulations in order to highlight the sharp change of
behaviour between Hill stable and Hill unstable systems. We show that Hill
stable systems tend to be very regular whereas Hill unstable ones often lead to
rapid planet collisions. We also remind that Hill stability does not protect
from the ejection of the outer planet.

product system where the Perron-Frobenius cocycle has infinitely many distinct
Lyapunov exponents, but where arbitrarily small natural perturbations cause a
complete collapse of the Lyapunov spectrum, except for the exponent 0
associated with the absolutely continuous invariant measure. That is, under
perturbations, the Lyapunov exponents become 0 with multiplicity 1, and
$-\infty$ with infinite multiplicity. This is superficially similar to the
finite-dimensional phenomenon, discovered by Bochi \cite{Bochi-thesis}, that
away from the uniformly hyperbolic setting, small perturbations can lead to a
collapse of the Lyapunov spectrum to zero. In this paper, however, the cocycle
and its perturbation are explicitly described; and further, the mechanism for
collapse is quite different.

random Blaschke products. We give a necessary and sufficient criterion for
stability of the Lyapunov spectrum in terms of the derivative of the random

micro-channels. A micro-mixer has two input channels and two output channels;
it receives two fluid droplets, one from each input, mixes them perfectly, and
produces two droplets of the mixed fluid on its output channels. Such a mixing
graph converts a set I of input droplets into a set T of output droplets, where
the droplets are specified by their reactant concentrations. The most
fundamental algorithmic question related to mixing graphs is to determine,
given an input set I and a target set T, whether there is a mixing graph that

FUors or FUor-like have very similar near-IR spectra. We use this spectral
similarity to determine the extinction to each source, and correlate the
extinction to the depth of the 3 micron ice band. All bona fide FUors still
today maintain the spectrum of a FUor, despite the eruption occurring up to 80
years ago. Most FUors and FUor-like objects occupy a unique space on a plot of
Na+Ca vs. CO equivalent widths, whereas the peculiar objects tend to be found
mostly elsewhere. Since most FUors show a reflection nebula, we also present an
atlas of K-band images of each target. We found that the near-IR spectra of
FUors and young brown dwarfs can be extremely similar, a distinguishing feature
being the Paschen beta absorption in the spectra of FUors. Although V1647 Ori,
AR 6a, and V346 Normae had been previously classified as candidate FUors, we
classify them as peculiar objects with some FUor-like properties since their
spectra now differ significantly from bona fide FUors. We confirm two new
FUor-like objects that were initially identified as candidates based on their
near-IR morphology.

such $\beta_{\parallel p}$-dependent limits on $R_p$ in Earth's magnetosheath.
The distribution of these data across the $(\beta_{\parallel p},R_p)$-plane

compute contours of constant growth-rate for the ion-cyclotron, mirror,

$1.6\,\rm{\mu m}$ with a wide-field camera instrument, the Multi-purpose
Infra-Red Imaging System (MIRIS) onboard the Korean satellite STSAT-3. The DGL
brightness is measured by correlating the near-IR images with a far-IR
$100\,\rm{\mu m}$ map of interstellar dust thermal emission. The wide-field
observation of DGL provides the most accurate DGL measurement achieved to date.
We also find a linear correlation between optical and near-IR DGL in the MBM32
field. To study interstellar dust properties in MBM32, we adopt recent dust
models with or without $\rm{\mu m}$-sized very large grains and predict the DGL
spectra, taking into account reddening effect of interstellar radiation field.
The result shows that observed color of the near-IR DGL is closer to the model

  Selection between SZ and ZFP","14 pages, 9 figures, first revision",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With ever-increasing volumes of scientific data produced by HPC applications,
significantly reducing data size is critical because of limited capacity of
storage space and potential bottlenecks on I/O or networks in writing/reading
or transferring data. SZ and ZFP are the two leading lossy compressors
available to compress scientific data sets. However, their performance is not
consistent across different data sets and across different fields of some data
sets: for some fields SZ provides better compression performance, while other
fields are better compressed with ZFP. This situation raises the need for an
automatic online (during compression) selection between SZ and ZFP, with a
minimal overhead. In this paper, the automatic selection optimizes the
rate-distortion, an important statistical quality metric based on the
signal-to-noise ratio. To optimize for rate-distortion, we investigate the
principles of SZ and ZFP. We then propose an efficient online, low-overhead
selection algorithm that predicts the compression quality accurately for two
compressors in early processing stages and selects the best-fit compressor for
each data field. We implement the selection algorithm into an open-source
library, and we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solution against
plain SZ and ZFP in a parallel environment with 1,024 cores. Evaluation results
on three data sets representing about 100 fields show that our selection
algorithm improves the compression ratio up to 70% with the same level of data
distortion because of very accurate selection (around 99%) of the best-fit
compressor, with little overhead (less than 7% in the experiments).

for the ML model, we use an auto-encoder type convolutional neural network

time series of instantaneous velocity fields in a single cross-section obtained
by direct numerical simulation (DNS) so as to output the cross-sectional
velocity field at a specified future time instant. From the a priori test in
which the output from the trained ML model are recycled to the input, the
spatio-temporal evolution of cross-sectional structure is found to be
reasonably well reproduced by the proposed method. The turbulence statistics
obtained in the a priori test are also, in general, in reasonable agreement
with the DNS data, although some deviation in the flow rate was found. It is
also found that the present machine-learned inflow generator is free from the
spurious periodicity, unlike the conventional driver DNS in a periodic domain.
As an a posteriori test, we perform DNS of inflow-outflow turbulent channel
flow with the trained ML model used as a machine-learned turbulent inflow
generator (MLTG) at the inlet. It is shown that the present MLTG can maintain
the turbulent channel flow for a long time period sufficient to accumulate
turbulent statistics, with much lower computational cost than the corresponding
driver simulation. It is also demonstrated that we can obtain accurate
turbulent statistics by properly correcting the deviation in the flow rate.

one vertex. However, it is pervasive that a character is denoted by two or more
vertices with different names, thus it is usually considered as multiple,
different characters. This problem causes incorrectness of results in network
analysis and mining. The factual challenge is that character uniqueness is hard
to correctly confirm due to lots of complicated factors, e.g. name changing and
anonymization, leading to character duplication. Early, limited research has
shown that previous methods depended overly upon supplementary attribute
information from databases. In this paper, we propose a novel method to merge
the character vertices which refer to as the same entity but are denoted with
different names. With this method, we firstly build the relationship network
among characters based on records of social activities participated, which are
extracted from multimedia sources. Then define temporal activity paths (TAPs)
for each character over time. After that, we measure similarity of the TAPs for
any two characters. If the similarity is high enough, the two vertices should
be considered to the same character. Based on TAPs, we can determine whether to
merge the two character vertices. Our experiments shown that this solution can
accurately confirm character uniqueness in large-scale social network.

arbitrarily small spatial extent, that there is a minimum width approximately
equal to the Compton wavelength. Our argument is in four parts. First, the
scalar function used by Newton and Wigner as a measure of localization is not a
position probability amplitude. The correct relativistic position probability
amplitude becomes a delta function for a state vector localized according to
the criteria of Newton and Wigner. Second, the possibility of Lorentz
contraction as observed from a boosted frame means that the wavepacket width in
the boost direction can take arbitrarily small values. Third, we refer to the
work of Almeida and Jabs (Am. J. Phys. 52, 921 (1984)) who show that the long
time wavepacket spreading rate for relativistic position probability amplitudes
is always less than the speed of light no matter how small the initial width of

de Sitter space by quantum metrological techniques. By exploring the dynamics
of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt detector, which interacts with a scalar field
coupling to curvature, we calculate the Fisher information (FI) and quantum
Fisher information (QFI) for the detector, which bound the highest precision of
the estimation on Hubble parameter. In standard Bunch-Davies vacuum, we show
that the maxima of FI/QFI are located for particular initial state of probe.
Beside its dependence on the evolving time of detector and the energy spacing
of atom $\omega$, we show that the maxima of FI/QFI can be significantly
enhanced once a proper coupling of scalar field to curvature is chosen. For
instance, we show numerically that the estimation in the scenario with
minimally/nearly minimally coupling scalar field can always outperform that
with conformally coupling scalar field, corresponding to a higher FI/QFI in
estimation. Moreover, we find that for general $\alpha-$vacua of de Sitter
space, a further improvement of estimation can be achieved, attributed to the
squeezed nature of $\alpha-$vacua that heavily constrains the measurement
uncertainty. Some implications of our results are also discussed.

evaluating CHSH inequality on a localized two-atom system. We show that quantum
nonlocality can be generated through the Markovian evolution of two-atom,
witnessed by a violation of CHSH inequality on its final equilibrium state. We
find that the upper bound of inequality violation is determined by different
choices of de Sitter-invariant vacua sectors. In particular, with growing
Gibbons-Hawking temperature, the CHSH bound degrades monotonously for
Bunch-Davies vacuum sector. Due to the intrinsic correlation of
non-Bunch-Davies vacua, we find that the related violation of inequality can
however drastically increase after certain turning point, and may persist for
arbitrarily large environment decoherence. This implies that the CHSH
inequality is useful to classify the initial quantum state of the Universe.
Finally, we clarify that the witnessed intrinsic correlation of
non-Bunch-Davies vacua can be utilized for quantum information applications,
e.g., surpassing the Heisenberg uncertainty bound of quantum measurement in de

can be largely addressed by the recent network architecture known as mobile
edge computing (MEC), which enables caching and computing capabilities at the
edge of wireless networks. This paper presents a novel MEC-based mobile VR
delivery framework that is able to cache parts of the field of views (FOVs) in
advance and run certain post-processing procedures at the mobile VR device. To
optimize resource allocation at the mobile VR device, we formulate a joint
caching and computing decision problem to minimize the average required
transmission rate while meeting a given latency constraint. When FOVs are
homogeneous, we obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal joint policy
which reveals interesting communications-caching-computing tradeoffs. When FOVs
are heterogeneous, we obtain a local optima of the problem by transforming it
into a linearly constrained indefinite quadratic problem then applying concave
convex procedure. Numerical results demonstrate great promises of the proposed
mobile VR delivery framework in saving communication bandwidth while meeting
low latency requirement.

two-dimensional Hubbard model by mean-field calculations. The focus falls on
Van Hove filling and the the hopping amplitude t'/t=0.341. The fRG data suggest
a quantum critical point (QCP) in this region and in its vicinity a singular
fermionic self-energy, Im $\Sigma(\omega)/\omega \sim |\omega|^{-\gamma}$ with
$\gamma\approx 0.26$. Here we start a more detailed investigation of this QCP
using a bosonic formulation for the effective action, where the bosons couple
to the order parameter fields. To this end, we use the channel decomposition of
the fermionic effective action developed in [Phys. Rev. B 79, 195125 (2009)],
which allows to perform Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations for all relevant
order parameter fields at any given energy scale. We stop the flow at a scale
where the correlations of the order parameter field are already pronounced, but
the flow is still regular, and derive the effective boson theory. It contains
d-wave superconducting, magnetic, and density-density interactions. We analyze
the resulting phase diagram in the mean-field approximation. We show that the
singular fermionic self-energy suppresses gap formation both in the
superconducting and magnetic channel already at the mean-field level, thus
rounding a first-order transition (without self-energy) to a quantum phase
transition (with self-energy). We give a simple effective model that shows the
generality of this effect. In the two-dimensional Hubbard model, the effective
density-density interaction is peaked at a nonzero frequency, so that solving
the mean-field equations already involves a functional equation instead of
simply a matrix equation (on a technical level, similar to incommensurate
phases). Within a certain approximation, we show that such an interaction leads
to a short quasiparticle lifetime.

(in each time step) if they have at least $r$ already-infected neighbours.
Motivated by its close connections to models from statistical physics, such as
the Ising model of ferromagnetism, and kinetically constrained spin models of
the liquid-glass transition, the most extensively-studied case is the
two-neighbour bootstrap process on the two-dimensional grid $[n]^2$. Around 15
years ago, in a major breakthrough, Holroyd determined the sharp threshold for
percolation in this model, and his bounds were subsequently sharpened further
by Gravner and Holroyd, and by Gravner, Holroyd and Morris.
  In this paper we strengthen the lower bound of Gravner, Holroyd and Morris by
proving that the critical probability $p_c\big( [n]^2,2 \big)$ for percolation
in the two-neighbour model on $[n]^2$ satisfies \[p_c\big( [n]^2,2 \big) =
\frac{\pi^2}{18\log n} - \frac{\Theta(1)}{(\log n)^{3/2}}\,.\] The proof of
this result requires a very precise understanding of the typical growth of a
critical droplet, and involves a number of technical innovations. We expect
these to have other applications, for example, to the study of more general
two-dimensional cellular automata, and to the $r$-neighbour process in higher
dimensions.

Probabilistic Software Modeling provides increased comprehension for engineers
without changing the level of abstraction. The approach relies on the recursive
decomposition principle of object-oriented programming to build hierarchies of
probabilistic models that are fitted via observations collected at runtime of a
software system. This leads to a network of models that mirror the static
structure of the software system while modeling its dynamic runtime behavior.
The resulting models can be used in applications such as test-case generation,

multi-antenna macro base station (MBS), multiple multi-antenna small base
stations (SBSs) and multiple single-antenna user equipment (UEs). The SBSs are
empowered by edge clouds offering limited computing services for UEs, whereas
the MBS provides high-performance central cloud computing services to UEs via a
restricted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) backhaul to their associated
SBSs. With processing latency constraints at the central and edge networks, we
aim to minimize the system energy consumption used for task offloading and
computation. The problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the cloud
selection, the UEs' transmit powers, the SBSs' receive beamformers, and the
SBSs' transmit covariance matrices, which is {a mixed-integer and non-convex
optimization problem}. Based on methods such as decomposition approach and
successive pseudoconvex approach, a tractable solution is proposed via an
iterative algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed solution can
achieve great performance gain over conventional schemes using edge or central
cloud alone. Also, with large-scale antennas at the MBS, the massive MIMO
backhaul can significantly reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm and
obtain even better performance.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented rising of time series from
almost all kindes of academic and industrial fields. Various types of deep
neural network models have been introduced to time series analysis, but the
important frequency information is yet lack of effective modeling. In light of
this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure called
multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware
deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of
multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables
the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based
on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual
Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for
time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take
all or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input,
and resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters
globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis
into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a
real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our
time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance
analysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those
time-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time
series analysis. This indeed indicates the interpretability advantage of mWDN,
and can be viewed as an indepth exploration to interpretable deep learning.

resistive contacts due to formation of large Schottky barriers and considerably

important issues in monolayer $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ Field-Effect transistors

Nitride (h-BN), using bilayer h-BN at the metal/SC interface. The bilayer h-BN
eliminates the metal/$\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ chemical interactions, preserves the
electrical properties of $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ and reduces the contact resistances
by prevention of Fermi-level pinning. We investigate electrical transport in
the monolayer $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ FETs that yields close to intrinsic electron
mobilities ($\approx 26\ \mathrm{cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}}$) even at room
temperature. Moreover, we experimentally study the charge transport through
Metal/h-BN/$\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ tunnel contacts and we explicitly show that the
dielectric bilayer of h-BN provides highly efficient gating (tuning the Fermi
energy) of the $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ channel at the contact regions even with small
biases. Also we provide a theoretical model that allows to understand and
reproduce the experimental $I-V$ characteristics of the contacts. These
observations give an insight into the electrical behavior of the metal/h-BN/2D

resonance of a small dielectric particle embedded in a lossy surrounding
medium. The optimal resonance at any given frequency is defined by the complex
valued dielectric constant that maximizes the absorption of the particle under
the quasistatic approximation and a passivity constraint. In particular, for an
ellipsoid aligned along the exciting field, the optimal material property is
given by the complex conjugate of the pole position associated with the
polarizability of the particle. In this paper, we employ classical Mie theory
to analyze this approximation for spherical particles in a lossy surrounding
medium. It turns out that the quasistatic optimal plasmonic resonance is valid
provided that the electrical size of the particle is sufficiently small at the
same time as the external losses are sufficiently large. Hence, it is important
to note that this approximation can not be used for a lossless medium, and
which is also obvious since the quasistatic optimal dipole absorption becomes
unbounded for this case. Moreover, it turns out that the optimal normalized
absorption cross section area of the small dielectric sphere has a very subtle
limiting behavior, and is in fact unbounded even in full dynamics when both the
electrical size as well as the exterior losses tend to zero at the same time. A
detailed analysis is carried out to assess the validity of the quasistatic
estimation of the optimal resonance and numerical examples are included to
illustrate the asymptotic results.

'importance' of actors in social networks. Current measures scrutinize either
local or global connectivity of the nodes and have been found to be inadequate
for social networks. Ignoring hierarchy and community structure, which are
inherent in all human social networks, is the primary cause of this inadequacy.
Positional hierarchy and embeddedness of an actor in the community are
intuitively crucial determinants of his importance. The theory of social
capital asserts that an actor's importance is derived from his position in
network hierarchy as well as from the potential to mobilize resources through
intra-community (bonding) and inter-community (bridging) ties. Inspired by this
idea, we propose a novel centrality measure SC (Social Centrality) for actors
in social networks. Our measure accounts for - i) an individual's propensity to
socialize, and ii) his connections within and outside the community. These two
factors are suitably aggregated to produce social centrality score. Comparative
analysis of SC measure with classical and recent centrality measures using
large public networks shows that it consistently produces a more realistic
ranking of nodes. The inference is based on the available ground truth for each
tested networks. Extensive analysis of rankings delivered by SC measure and
mapping with known facts in well-studied networks justifies its effectiveness
in diverse social networks. Scalability evaluation of SC measure justifies its
efficacy for real-world large networks.

The present paper develops an approach for analog-to-digital conversion that
aims at minimizing the number of bits per sample at the output of the
converter. This is attained by reducing the dynamic range of the analog signal
by performing a modulo operation on its amplitude, and then quantizing the
result. While the converter itself is universal and agnostic of the statistics
of the signal, the decoder operation on the output of the quantizer can exploit
the statistical structure in order to unwrap the modulo folding. The
performance of this method is shown to approach information theoretical limits,
as captured by the rate-distortion function, in various settings. An
architecture for modulo analog-to-digital conversion via ring oscillators is
suggested, and its merits are numerically demonstrated.

SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, and H7N9 in 2013, have become the critical threat
to the public health and a hunting nightmare to the government. Understanding
the propagation in large-scale metapopulations and predicting the future
outbreaks thus become crucially important for epidemic control and prevention.
In the literature, there have been a bulk of studies on modeling intra-city
epidemic propagation but with the single population assumption (homogeneity).
Some recent works on metapopulation propagation, however, focus on finding
specific human mobility physical networks to approximate diseases transmission
networks, whose generality to fit different diseases cannot be guaranteed. In
this paper, we argue that the intra-city epidemic propagation should be modeled
on a metapopulation base, and propose a two-step method for this purpose. The
first step is to understand the propagation system by inferring the underlying
disease infection network. To this end, we propose a novel network inference
model called D$^2$PRI, which reduces the individual network into a
sub-population network without information loss, and incorporates the power-law
distribution prior and data prior for better performance. The second step is to
predict the disease propagation by extending the classic SIR model to a
metapopulation SIR model that allows visitors transmission between any two
sub-populations. The validity of our model is testified on a real-life clinical
report data set about the airborne disease in the Shenzhen city, China. The
D$^2$PRI model with the extended SIR model exhibit superior performance in
various tasks including network inference, infection prediction and outbreaks
simulation.

affirmative reactions from other Twitter users via Retweets. Retweet count is
thus considered as a surrogate measure for positive crowd-sourced reactions -
high number of retweets of a tweet aid in making its topic trending. This in
turn bolsters the social reputation of the author of the tweet. Since social
reputation/impact of users/tweets influences many decisions (such as promoting
brands, advertisement etc.), several blackmarket syndicates have actively been
engaged in producing fake retweets in a collusive manner. Users who want to
boost the impact of their tweets approach the blackmarket services, and gain
retweets for their own tweets by either paying money (Premium Services) or by
retweeting other customers' tweets. Thus they become customers of blackmarket
syndicates and engage in fake activities. Interestingly, these customers are
neither bots, nor even fake users - they are usually normal human beings; they
express a mix of organic and inorganic retweeting activities, and there is no
synchronicity across their behaviors. In this paper, we make a first attempt to
investigate such blackmarket customers engaged in producing fake retweets. We
collected and annotated a novel dataset comprising of customers of many
blackmarket services and show how their social behavior differs from genuine
users. We then use state-of-the-art supervised models to detect three types of
customers (bots, promotional, normal) and genuine users. We achieve a Macro

further design a browser extension, SCoRe which, given the link of a tweet,
spots its fake retweeters in real-time. We also collected users' feedback on
the performance of SCoRe and obtained 85% accuracy.

interferometer, two different dynamical regimes of light modulation are
experimentally studied: (a) modulation of the input light by the rotating
quarter-wave plate (QWP); and (b) modulation of the testing beam by a
birefringent plate with electrically controlled anisotropy represented by the
deformed-helix ferroelectric liquid crystal (DHFLC) cell. In the setup with the
rotating QWP, the interferometric phase is found to be equal to the relative
Uhlmann phase. Experimental and theoretical results being in excellent
agreement both show that this phase is an oscillating function of the QWP angle
and increases with the degree of polarization. For modulation by the DHFLC
cell, the data derived from our electro-optic measurements are fitted using the
theory of the orientational Kerr effect in FLCs. This theory in combination
with the results of fitting is used to evaluate electric field dependencies of
the interferometric and the Uhlmann phases.

how to use the time budget most efficiently arises. We propose to first start
k>=1 independent runs of the algorithm during an initialization budget t1<t,
pausing these runs, then apply a decision maker D to choose 1<=m<=k runs from
them (consuming t2>=0 time units in doing so), and then continuing these runs
for the remaining t3=t-t1-t2 time units. In previous Bet-and-Run strategies,
the decision maker D=currentBest would simply select the run with the best-
so-far results at negligible time. We propose using more advanced methods to
discriminate between ""good"" and ""bad"" sample runs, with the goal of increasing
the correlation of the chosen run with the a-posteriori best one. We test
several different approaches, including neural networks trained or polynomials
fitted on the current trace of the algorithm to predict which run may yield the
best results if granted the remaining budget. We show with extensive

to that estimated from dust-corrected UV data. We use a sample of $\sim$200
galaxies and AGN at $1.40<z<2.61$ with 24 $\mu$m detections (rest-frame
8$\mu$m) from MIPS/\textit{Spitzer}. We find that the identification of
MIR-excess galaxies strongly depends on the methodologies used to estimate IR
luminosity ($\rm L_{IR}$) and to correct the UV light for dust attenuation. We
find that extrapolations of the SFR from the observed 24 $\mu$m flux, using
luminosity-dependent templates based on local galaxies, substantially
overestimate $\rm L_{IR}$ in $z\sim2$ galaxies. By including \textit{Herschel}
observations and using a stellar mass-dependent, luminosity-independent $\rm
L_{IR}$, we obtain more reliable estimates of the SFR and a lower fraction of
MIR-excess galaxies. Once stellar mass selection biases are taken into account,
we identify $\sim24\%$ of our galaxies as MIR-excess. However, $\rm
SFR_{H\alpha}$ is not elevated in MIR-excess galaxies compared to MIR-normal
galaxies, indicating that the intrinsic fraction of MIR-excess may be lower.
Using X-ray, IR, and optically-selected AGN in MOSDEF, we do not find a higher
prevalence for AGN in MIR-excess galaxies relative to MIR-normal galaxies. A
stacking analysis of X-ray undetected galaxies does not reveal a harder
spectrum in MIR-excess galaxies relative to MIR-normal galaxies. Our analysis
indicates that AGN activity does not contribute substantially to the MIR excess
and instead implies that it is likely due to the enhanced PAH emission.

at room temperature and varying confining pressures up to 150 MPa. Ultrasonic
velocity measurements, at varying directions to the compression axis, were
combined with mechanical measurements of axial and volumetric strain, during
direct loading and cyclic loading triaxial deformation tests. An additional
deformation experiment was conducted on a specimen of Westerly granite for
comparison. At all confining pressures, brittle deformation in antigorite is
associated with a spectacular absence of stress-induced anisotropy and with no
noticeable dependence of wave velocities on axial compressive stress, prior to
rock failure. The strength of antigorite samples is comparable to that of
granite, but the mechanical behaviour is elastic up to high stress
($\gtrsim80$\% of rock strength) and non-dilatant. Microcracking is only
observed in antigorite specimens taken to failure and not in those loaded even
at $90-95$\% of their compressive strength. Microcrack damage is extremely
localised near the fault and consists of shear microcracks that form
exclusively along the cleavage plane of antigorite crystals. Our observations
demonstrate that brittle deformation in antigorite occurs entirely by ""mode II""
shear microcracking. This is all the more remarkable than the preexisting
microcrack population in antigorite is comparable to that in granite. The
mechanical behaviour and seismic signature of antigorite brittle deformation
thus appears to be unique within crystalline rocks.

appropriate exposure values, and moreover, it is difficult to set appropriate

proposed method, the luminance of the input multi-exposure images is adjusted
on the basis of the relationship between exposure values and pixel values,
where the relationship is obtained by assuming that a digital camera has a
linear response function. The use of a local contrast enhancement method is
also considered to improve input multi-exposure images. The compensated images
are finally combined by one of existing multi-exposure image fusion methods. In

particular, a computationally-convenient system is presented to combat two
major research problems in sensor networks. First is the conventionally-tackled
resource optimization problem which triggers the drainage of battery at a
faster rate within a network. Such drainage promotes inefficient resource usage
thereby causing sudden death of the network. The second main bottleneck for
such networks is that of data degradation. This is because the nodes in such
networks communicate via a wireless channel, where the inevitable presence of
noise corrupts the data making it unsuitable for practical applications.
Therefore, we present a layer-adaptive method via 3-tier communication
mechanism to ensure the efficient use of resources. This is supported with a
mathematical coverage model that deals with the formation of coverage holes. We

  Time","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1802.05137",,,,"math.NA math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an adaptive space-time mesh refinement approach based a domain
decomposition approach (Singh and Wheeler, 2018) that allows different
time-step sizes and mesh refinements in different subdomains. Our numerical
experiments indicate that non-linear solvers fail to converge, to the desired
tolerance, due to large non-linear residuals in a smaller subdomain. We exploit
this feature to identify subdomains where smaller time-step sizes are necessary
while using large time-step sizes in the rest of the reservoir domain. The
three key components of our approach are: (1) a space-time, enhanced velocity,
domain decomposition approach that allows different mesh refinements and
time-step sizes in different subdomains while preserving local mass
conservation, (2) a residual based error estimator to identify or mark regions
(or subdomains) that pose non-linear convergence issues, and (3) a fully
coupled monolithic solver is also presented that solves the coarse and fine
subdomain problems, both in space and time, simultaneously. This solution
scheme is fully implicit and is therefore unconditionally stable. The proposed
space-time domain decomposition approach, with smaller time-step sizes in a
subdomain and large time-step sizes everywhere else, circumvents the non-linear
convergence issue without adding computational costs. Additionally, a
space-time monolithic solver renders a massively parallel, time concurrent
framework for solving flow and transport problems in subsurface porous media.
Since the proposed approach is similar to the widely used finite difference
scheme, it can be easily integrated in any existing legacy reservoir simulator.

polycrystals as alternative to the Finite Element method (FEM). The variational
FFT approach is used with a crystal plasticity model for the cyclic behavior of
the grains introduced through a FEM material subroutine, in particular an
Abaqus umat. The framework also includes an alternative projection operator
based on discrete differentiation to improve the microfield fidelity allowing
to include second phases. The accuracy and efficiency of the FFT framework for
microstructure sensitive fatigue prediction are assessed by comparing with FEM.
The macroscopic cyclic response of a polycrystal obtained with both methods
were indistinguishable, irrespective of the number of cycles. The microscopic
fields presented small differences that decrease when using the discrete
projection operator, which indeed allowed simulating accurately microstructures
containing very stiff particles. Finally, the maximum differences in the
fatigue life estimation from the microfields respect FEM were around 15% . In
summary, this framework allows predicting fatigue life with a similar accuracy
than using FEM but strongly reducing the computational cost.

estimation and uncertainty quantification of unknown parameters in geo-physical
inversion problems. Badlands is a basin and landscape evolution forward model
for simulating topography evolution at a large range of spatial and time
scales. Our previous work presented Bayeslands that used the Bayesian paradigm
to make inference for unknown parameters in the Badlands model using Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Bayeslands faced challenges in convergence
due to multi-modal posterior distributions in the selected parameters of
Badlands. Parallel tempering is an advanced MCMC method suited for irregular
and multi-modal posterior distributions. In this paper, we extend Bayeslands
using parallel tempering (PT-Bayeslands) with high performance computing to
address previous limitations in parameter space exploration in the context of
the computationally expensive Badlands model. Our results show that
PT-Bayeslands not only reduces the computation time, but also provides an
improvement of the sampling for multi-modal posterior distributions. This
provides an improvement over Bayeslands which used single chain MCMC that face
difficulties in convergence and can lead to misleading inference. This
motivates its usage in large-scale basin and landscape evolution models.

  Quantification of Partially Observed and Unobserved States in Power Grids",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a physics-informed Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to
predict the phase angle, angular speed, and wind mechanical power from a
limited number of measurements. In the traditional data-driven GPR method, the
form of the Gaussian Process covariance matrix is assumed and its parameters
are found from measurements. In the physics-informed GPR, we treat unknown
variables (including wind speed and mechanical power) as a random process and
compute the covariance matrix from the resulting stochastic power grid
equations. We demonstrate that the physics-informed GPR method is significantly
more accurate than the standard data-driven one for immediate forecasting of
generators' angular velocity and phase angle. We also show that the
physics-informed GPR provides accurate predictions of the unobserved wind
mechanical power, phase angle, or angular velocity when measurements from only
one of these variables are available. The immediate forecast of observed
variables and predictions of unobserved variables can be used for effectively
managing power grids (electricity market clearing, regulation actions) and
early detection of abnormal behavior and faults. The physics-based GPR forecast
time horizon depends on the combination of input (wind power, load, etc.)
correlation time and characteristic (relaxation) time of the power grid and can
be extended to short and medium-range times.

patients are treated with a fixed beamline and in two gantries for ocular and
non-ocular malignancies, respectively. For the installation of a third gantry a
new patient safety system (PaSS) was developed and is sequentially being rolled
out to update the existing areas. The aim of PaSS is to interrupt the treatment
whenever any sub-system detects a hazardous condition. To ensure correct
treatment delivery, this system needs to be thoroughly tested as part of the
regular quality assurance (QA) protocols as well as after any upgrade. In the
legacy safety systems, unit testing required an extensive use of resources: two
weeks of work per area in the laboratory in addition to QA beam time. In order
to significantly reduce the time, an automated PaSS test stand for unit testing
was developed based on a PXI chassis with virtually unlimited IOs that are
synchronously stimulated or sampled at 1 MHz. It can emulate the rest of the
facility using adapters to connect each type of interface. With it PaSS can be
tested under arbitrary conditions. A VHDL-based formal language was developed
to describe stimuli, expected behaviour and specific measurements, interpreted
by a LabView runtime environment. This article describes the tools and
methodology being applied for unit testing and QA release tests for the new
PaSS. It shows how automation and formalization made possible an increase in
test coverage while significantly cutting down the laboratory testing time and
facility's beam usage.

re-compressed by the social network providers. Because of such a situation, a
new image identification scheme for double-compressed JPEG images is proposed
in this paper. The aim is to detect single-compressed images that have the same
original image as that of a double-compressed one. In the proposed scheme, the
signs of only DC coefficients in DCT coefficients and one threshold value are
used for the identification. The use of them allows us to robustly avoid errors
caused by double-compression, which are not considered in conventional schemes.
The proposed scheme has applications not only to find uploaded images
corresponding to double-compressed ones, but also to detect some image
integrity. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed one outperforms
conventional ones including state-of-art image hashing one in terms of the
querying performance.
