Very stiff equations of state are ruled out by the upper limit on the average
tidal deformability, $\tilde\Lambda \lesssim 800$, imposed by the detected
gravitational wave signal. A lower limit, $\tilde\Lambda \gtrsim 400$, can also
be extracted by considering the large amount of ejected matter which powers the
kilonova AT2017gfo. By using several microscopic nucleonic equations of state,
we first confirm the existence of a monotonic relation between $R_{1.5}$ (the
radius of the $1.5M_{\odot}$ configuration) and $\tilde\Lambda$. This
translates the limits on $\tilde\Lambda$ into limits on the radius:
$11.8\,\text{km} \lesssim R_{1.5} \lesssim 13.1\,$km. We then show that the
monotonic relation is violated, if a second branch of compact stars composed of
quark matter exists, as in the two-families or the twin-stars scenarios. In
particular, it is possible to fulfill the limits on $\tilde\Lambda$ while
having $R_{1.5}$ significantly smaller than $12\,$km. In both those scenarios
the event GW170817/AT2017gfo originates from the merger of a hadronic star and
a star containing quark matter.

the possible abundance of primordial black holes. Depending on uncertainties

a neural embedding function and a memory module filled with diverse reference

large volumes of data, labeling costs and difficulty make it hard to build a

from health care to astronomy, and include climate modelling, financial trading
and monitoring of critical engineering equipment. To offer value over this
range of activities, models must not only provide accurate forecasts, but also
quantify and adjust their uncertainty over time. In this work, we directly
tackle this task with a novel, fully end-to-end deep learning method for time
series forecasting. By recasting time series forecasting as an ordinal
regression task, we develop a principled methodology to assess long-term
predictive uncertainty and describe rich multimodal, non-Gaussian behaviour,
which arises regularly in applied settings.
  Notably, our framework is a wholly general-purpose approach that requires
little to no user intervention to be used. We showcase this key feature in a
large-scale benchmark test with 45 datasets drawn from both, a wide range of
real-world application domains, as well as a comprehensive list of synthetic
maps. This wide comparison encompasses state-of-the-art methods in both the
Machine Learning and Statistics modelling literature, such as the Gaussian
Process. We find that our approach does not only provide excellent predictive
forecasts, shadowing true future values, but also allows us to infer valuable
information, such as the predictive distribution of the occurrence of critical
events of interest, accurately and reliably even over long time horizons.

moving infinite wall is revisited in the context of dense granular flows of
mono-dispersed beads using the recently proposed $\mu(I)$--rheology. In
Newtonian fluids, molecular diffusion brings about a self-similar velocity
profile and the boundary layer in which the fluid motion takes place increases
indefinitely with time $t$ as $\sqrt{\nu t}$, where $\nu$ is the kinematic
viscosity. For a dense granular visco-plastic liquid, it is shown that the
local shear stress, when properly rescaled, exhibits self-similar behaviour at
short-time scales and it then rapidly evolves towards a steady-state solution.
The resulting shear layer increases in thickness as $\sqrt{\nu_g t}$ analogous
to a Newtonian fluid where $\nu_g$ is an equivalent granular kinematic
viscosity depending not only on the intrinsic properties of the granular media
such as grain diameter $d$, density $\rho$ and friction coefficients but also
on the applied pressure $p_w$ at the moving wall and the solid fraction $\phi$
(constant). In addition, the $\mu(I)$--rheology indicates that this growth
continues until reaching the steady-state boundary layer thickness $\delta_s =
\beta_w (p_w/\phi \rho g )$, independent of the grain size, at about a finite
time proportional to $\beta_w^2 (p_w/\rho g d)^{3/2} \sqrt{d/g}$, where $g$ is
the acceleration due to gravity and $\beta_w = (\tau_w - \tau_s)/\tau_s$ is the
relative surplus of the steady-state wall shear-stress $\tau_w$ over the
critical wall shear stress $\tau_s$ (yield stress) that is needed to bring the
granular media into motion... (see article for a complete abstract).

our experimental findings to the calculated interband optical conductivity, we
can assign the features observed in the measured conductivity to certain
interband transitions. In particular, we find that transitions between the
electronic bands spilt by spin-orbit coupling dominate the interband
conductivity of NbP below 100 meV. At low temperatures, the momentum-relaxing
scattering rate of the itinerant carriers in NbP is very small, leading to
macroscopic characteristic length scales of the momentum relaxation of
approximately 0.5 $\mu$m.

  Systems and IoT","11 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is a growing need
for access control and data protection on low-power, pervasive devices.
Biometric-based authentication is promising for IoT due to its convenient
nature and lower susceptibility to attacks. However, the costs associated with
biometric processing and template protection are nontrivial for smart cards,
key fobs, and so forth. In this paper, we discuss the security, cost, and
utility of biometric systems and develop two major frameworks for improving
them. First, we introduce a new framework for implementing biometric systems
based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and hardware obfuscation that,
unlike traditional software approaches, does not require nonvolatile storage of
a biometric template/key. Aside from reducing the risk of compromising the
biometric, the nature of obfuscation also provides protection against access
control circumvention via malware and fault injection. The PUF provides
non-invertibility and non-linkability. Second, a major requirement of the
proposed PUF/obfuscation approach is that a reliable (robust) key be generated
from the users input biometric. We propose a noiseaware biometric quantization
framework capable of generating unique, reliable keys with reduced enrollment
time and denoising costs. Finally, we conduct several case studies. In the
first, the proposed noise-aware approach is compared to our previous approach
for multiple biometric modalities, including popular ones (fingerprint and
iris) and emerging cardiovascular ones (ECG and PPG). The results show that ECG
provides the best tradeoff between reliability, key length, entropy, and cost.
In the second and third case studies, we demonstrate how reliability, denoising
costs, and enrollment times can be simultaneously improved by modeling subject
intra-variations for ECG.

system depend on the specific input data, cost assumptions and system
constraints. Here this influence is studied using a techno-economic
optimisation model for a networked system of 30 European countries, taking into
account the capacity investment and operation of wind, solar, hydroelectricity,
natural gas power generation, transmission, and different storage options. A
considerable robustness of total system costs to the input weather data and to
moderate changes in the cost assumptions is observed. Flat directions in the
optimisation landscape around cost-optimal configurations often allow system
planners to choose between different technology options without a significant
increase in total costs, for instance by replacing onshore with offshore wind
power capacity in case of public acceptance issues. Exploring a range of carbon
dioxide emission limits shows that for scenarios with moderate transmission
expansion, a reduction of around 57% compared to 1990 levels is already cost
optimal. For stricter carbon dioxide limits, power generated from gas turbines
is at first replaced by generation from increasing renewable capacities.
Non-hydro storage capacities are only built for low-emission scenarios, in
order to provide the necessary flexibility to meet peaks in the residual load.

mechanics. The sim- plest interacting particle process is the Symmetric
Exclusion Process (SEP), a 1D lattice gas of particles that hop symmetrically
and cannot overlap. Combining the two gives a model for sticky particle
diffusion, SPM, which is described here. SPM dynamics are based on SEP with
short-range interaction, allowing flow due to non-equilibrium boundary
conditions. We prove that SPM is also a detailed-balance respecting,
particle-conserving, Monte Carlo (MC) description of the Ising model. Neither
the Ising model nor SEP have a phase transition in 1D, but the SPM exhibits a
non-equilibrium transition from a diffusing to a blocked state as stickiness
increases. This transition manifests in peaks in the MC density fluctuation, a
change in the dependency of flow-rate on stickiness, and odd structure in the
eigenspectrum of the transition rate matrix. We derive and solve a fully
non-linear, analytic, mean-field solution, which has a crossover from a
positive to a negative diffusion constant where the MC shows the transition.
The negative diffusion constant in fact indicates a breakdown of the mean-field
approximation, with close to zero flow and breaking into a two-phase mixture,
and thus the mean field theory successfully predicts its own demise. We also
present an analytic solution for the flow via direct analysis of the transition
rate matrix. The simplicity of the model suggest a wide range of possible
applications.

we prove that a mutation-based evolutionary algorithm with a large enough
population size, and a phenotypic distance function always succeeds in
optimising all functions of unitation for small niches in polynomial time,
while a genotypic distance function requires exponential time. Finally, we
prove that with phenotypic and genotypic distances clearing is able to find
both optima for Twomax and several general classes of bimodal functions in
polynomial expected time. We use empirical analysis to highlight some of the
characteristics that makes it a useful mechanism and to support the theoretical
results.

Problem of linear codes over $\mathbb F_2$, which can be stated as follows:
given a generator matrix $\mathbf A$ and an integer $k$, determine whether the
code generated by $\mathbf A$ has distance at most $k$. Here, $k$ is the
parameter of the problem. The question of whether $k$-Even Set is fixed
parameter tractable (FPT) has been repeatedly raised in literature and has
earned its place in Downey and Fellows' book (2013) as one of the ""most
infamous"" open problems in the field of Parameterized Complexity.
  In this work, we show that $k$-Even Set does not admit FPT algorithms under
the (randomized) Gap Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) [Dinur'16,
Manurangsi-Raghavendra'16]. In fact, our result rules out not only exact FPT
algorithms, but also any constant factor FPT approximation algorithms for the
problem. Furthermore, our result holds even under the following weaker
assumption, which is also known as the Parameterized Inapproximability
Hypothesis (PIH) [Lokshtanov et al.'17]: no (randomized) FPT algorithm can
distinguish a satisfiable 2CSP instance from one which is only
$0.99$-satisfiable (where the parameter is the number of variables).
  We also consider the parameterized $k$-Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), in
which we are given a lattice whose basis vectors are integral and an integer
$k$, and the goal is to determine whether the norm of the shortest vector (in
the $\ell_p$ norm for some fixed $p$) is at most $k$. Similar to $k$-Even Set,
this problem is also a long-standing open problem in the field of Parameterized
Complexity. We show that, for any $p > 1$, $k$-SVP is hard to approximate (in
FPT time) to some constant factor, assuming PIH. Furthermore, for the case of
$p = 2$, the inapproximability factor can be amplified to any constant.

employed by several recent methods that have shown its effectivenes in
characterizing gene sets associated to cancer. Mutual exclusivity arises
because of the complementarity, at the functional level, of alterations in
genes which are part of a group (e.g., a pathway) performing a given function.
The availability of quantitative target profiles, from genetic perturbations or
from clinical phenotypes, provides additional information that can be leveraged
to improve the identification of cancer related gene sets by discovering groups
with complementary functional associations with such targets.
  In this work we study the problem of finding groups of mutually exclusive

evidence of the effectiveness of UNCOVER in finding high-quality solutions and
show experimentally that UNCOVER finds sets of alterations significantly

framework, which distills the 3D human pose structures learned from the fully

of defining hard-coded rules to constrain the pose estimation results, we
design a novel multi-source discriminator to distinguish the predicted 3D poses
from the ground-truth, which helps to enforce the pose estimator to generate
anthropometrically valid poses even with images in the wild. We also observe
that a carefully designed information source for the discriminator is essential
to boost the performance. Thus, we design a geometric descriptor, which
computes the pairwise relative locations and distances between body joints, as
a new information source for the discriminator. The efficacy of our adversarial
learning framework with the new geometric descriptor has been demonstrated
through extensive experiments on widely used public benchmarks. Our approach
significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art

Noteworthy are the conversion of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) into a
proton-antiproton collider, the Tevatron collider, as well as the abandoned SSC
in the United States. Hadron colliders are likely to determine the pace of
particle-physics progress also during the next hundred years. Discoveries at
past hadron colliders were essential for establishing the so-called Standard
Model of particle physics. The world's present flagship collider, the LHC,
including its high-luminosity upgrade HL-LHC, is set to operate through the
second half of the 2030's. Further increases of the energy reach during the
21st century require another, still more powerful hadron collider. Three
options for a next hadron collider are presently under investigation. The
Future Circular Collider (FCC) study, hosted by CERN, is designing a 100 TeV
collider, to be installed inside a new 100 km tunnel in the Lake Geneva basin.
A similar 100 km collider, called SppC, is being pursued by CAS-IHEP in China.
In either machine, for the first time in hadron storage rings, synchrotron
radiation damping will be significant. In parallel, the synchrotron-radiation
power emitted inside the cold magnets becomes an important design constraint.
One important difference between FCC and SppC is the magnet technology. FCC
uses 16 Tesla magnets based on Nb3Sn superconductor, while SppC magnets shall
be realized with cables made from iron-based high-temperature superconductor.
Initially the SppC magnets are assumed to provide a more moderate dipole field
of 12 T, but they can later be pushed to a final ultimate field of 24 T. A
third collider presently under study is the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC), which is
a higher energy collider in the existing LHC tunnel, exploiting the FCC magnet
technology in order to double the LHC energy at significantly higher
luminosity.

robots get attacked, their communication channels get jammed, and their sensors
may fail, resulting in the withdrawal of robots from the collective task, and
consequently the inability of the remaining active robots to coordinate with

in contrast, resilient designs against system-wide failures and attacks become
important. In general, resilient design problems are hard, and even though they
often involve objective functions that are monotone or submodular, scalable

minimal communication, i.e., the algorithm is executed by the robots based only
on minimal communication between them; system-wide resiliency, i.e., the

interpreted as evidence that the diffusion of high-energy electrons and
positrons within pulsar wind nebulae is highly inefficient compared to the rest
of the interstellar medium. If the diffusion coefficient well outside the
nebula is close to the value inferred for the region inside the nebula,
high-energy electrons and positrons produced by the two observed pulsars could
not contribute significantly to the local measured cosmic-ray flux. The HAWC
Collaboration thus concluded that, under the assumption of isotropic and
homogeneous diffusion, the two pulsars are ruled out as sources of the
anomalous high-energy positron flux. Here, we argue that since the diffusion
coefficient is likely not spatially homogeneous, the assumption leading to this
conclusion is flawed. We solve the diffusion equation with a radially dependent
diffusion coefficient, and show that the pulsars observed by HAWC produce
potentially perfect matches to the observed high-energy positron fluxes. We
also study the implications of inefficient diffusion within pulsar wind nebulae

constraints spanning a wide range of epochs in cosmological history, from
pre-recombination distortions to the blackbody spectrum and anisotropies of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB), to modifications to the intergalactic medium
temperature and the resulting 21cm signal, and discuss the allowed signals in
the latter channels given the constraints from the former. We improve previous
constraints on DM-baryon scattering from the CMB anisotropies, demonstrate via
principal component analysis that the effect on the CMB can be written as a
simple function of DM mass, and map out the redshifts dominating this signal.
We show that given high-redshift constraints on DM-baryon scattering, a
$v^{-4}$ scaling of the cross section for light DM would be sufficient to
explain the deep 21cm absorption trough recently claimed by the EDGES
experiment, if 100% of the DM scatters with baryons. For millicharged DM models
proposed to explain the observation, where only a small fraction of the DM

generalized linear models is developed. The proposed algorithm scales to
situations in which the number of putative explanatory variables is very large,
possibly much larger than the number of responses. The coefficients in the
linear predictor are modeled as a three-component mixture allowing the
explanatory variables to have a random positive effect on the response, a
random negative effect, or no effect. A key assumption is that only a small
(but unknown) fraction of the candidate variables have a non-zero effect. This
assumption, in addition to treating the coefficients as random effects
facilitates an approach that is computationally efficient. In particular, the
number of parameters that have to be estimated is small, and remains constant
regardless of the number of explanatory variables. The model parameters are
estimated using a Generalized Alternating Maximization algorithm which is
scalable, and leads to significantly faster convergence compared with
simulation-based fully Bayesian methods.

additional effects that lower the gas temperature can substantially weaken the

the Mott insulator, origin of superconductivity and an effective low energy

coherence that spontaneously breaks U(1) valley symmetry, and describe a
mechanism that selects this order over the competing magnetically ordered
states favored by the Hunds coupling. We also identify symmetry related
features of the nearly flat band that are key to understanding the strong
correlation physics and constrain any tight binding description. First,
although the charge density is concentrated on the triangular lattice sites of
the moir$\text{\'e }$ pattern, the Wannier states of the tight-binding model
must be centered on different sites which form a honeycomb lattice. Next,
spatially localizing electrons derived from the nearly flat band necessarily
breaks valley and other symmetries within any mean-field treatment, which is
suggestive of a valley-ordered Mott state, and also dictates that additional
symmetry breaking is present to remove symmetry-enforced band contacts.
Tight-binding models describing the nearly flat mini-band are derived, which
highlight the importance of further neighbor hopping and interactions. We
discuss consequences of this picture for superconducting states obtained on
doping the valley ordered Mott insulator. We show how important features of the
experimental phenomenology may be explained and suggest a number of further
experiments for the future. We also describe a model for correlated states in

present a comprehensive assessment of the uncertainties associated with the

simulations from the source plane to the final LF that account for all lensing
effects and systematic uncertainties by comparing several mass models. In
addition to the size distribution, the choice of lens model leads to large
differences at magnitudes fainter than $M_{UV} = -15~$ AB mag, where the
magnification factor becomes highly uncertain. We perform MCMC simulations that
include all these uncertainties at the individual galaxy level to compute the
final LF, allowing, in particular, a crossover between magnitude bins. The best
LF fit, using a modified Schechter function that allows for a turnover at faint
magnitudes, gives a faint-end slope of $\alpha = -2.01_{-0.14}^{+0.12}$, a
curvature parameter of $\beta = 0.48_{-0.25}^{+0.49}$, and a turnover magnitude

the dust location from their $B-V$ colour evolution. We find a time-variable
colour excess $E(B-V)$ for 15 supernovae in our sample and constrain dust to
distances between 0.013 and 45 pc ($4\times10^{16}-10^{20}$ cm). For the
remaining supernovae, we obtain a constant $E(B-V)$ evolution and place lower
limits on the dust distance from the explosion. In all the 48 supernovae, the
inferred dust location is compatible with an interstellar origin for the
extinction. This is corroborated by the observation that supernovae with
relatively nearby dust ($\lesssim$ 1 pc) are located close to the center of
their host galaxy, in high-density dusty regions where interactions between the
supernova radiation and interstellar clouds close by are likely to occur. For
supernovae showing time-variable $E(B-V)$, we identify a potential preference

blue-shifted and time-variable absorption features. Within the interstellar

corresponds to 1.7\% of the total mass. This excludes a high mass fraction BH

elevated dynamical $M/L$s do indicate the presence of a substantial BH. Despite
not detecting massive BHs, these systems could still be stripped nuclei. The
strong rotation ($v/\sigma$ of 0.3 to 0.4) in both UCDs and the two-component
light profile in UCD330 support the idea that these UCDs may be stripped nuclei
of low-mass galaxies where the BH occupation fraction is not yet known.

metallicity distribution of 87 red giant branch stars is peaked at
[Fe/H]=-2.11+-0.01 dex, while that derived from 30 asymptotic giant branch

compatible with a null spread, pointing out that this cluster did not retain
the ejecta of supernovae. The small iron abundance offset between the two

out the possibility that NGC5824 is the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, as
previously suggested. We also find evidence of the chemical anomalies usually

is that the semi-annihilation effects are much more prominent in dwarf-sized
halos than in the more massive halos that host galaxies and clusters, even if
the corresponding cross sections are the same. Furthermore, the preferred

ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) VLSB-B, VLSB-D, and VCC615 located in the central
regions of the Virgo cluster. We spectroscopically identify 4, 12, and 7 GC
satellites of these UDGs, respectively. We find that the three UDGs have
systemic velocities ($V_{sys}$) consistent with being in the Virgo cluster, and
that they span a wide range of velocity dispersions, from $\sim 16$ to $\sim
47$ km/s, and high dynamical mass-to-light ratios within the radius that
contains half the number of GCs ($ 407^{+916}_{-407}$, $21^{+15}_{-11}$,
$60^{+65}_{-38}$, respectively). VLSB-D shows possible evidence for rotation
along the stellar major axis and its $V_{sys}$ is consistent with that of the
massive galaxy M84 and the center of the Virgo cluster itself. These findings,
in addition to having a dynamically and spatially ($\sim 1$ kpc) off-centered
nucleus and being extremely elongated, suggest that VLSB-D could be tidally
perturbed. On the contrary, VLSB-B and VCC615 show no signals of tidal
deformation. Whereas the dynamics of VLSB-D suggest that it has a less massive
dark matter halo than expected for its stellar mass, VLSB-B and VCC615 are
consistent with a $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ dark matter halo. Although our
samples of galaxies and GCs are small, these results suggest that UDGs may be a
diverse population, with their low surface brightnesses being the result of
very early formation, tidal disruption, or a combination of the two.

a few per cent of photon events and maps the hot gas properties closer to the
nucleus than has previously been possible. Within the supermassive black hole's
gravitational sphere of influence, the hot gas is multiphase and spans
temperatures from 0.2 to 1 keV. The radiative cooling time of the lowest
temperature gas drops to only 0.1-0.5 Myr, which is comparable to its free fall
time. Whilst the temperature structure is remarkably symmetric about the
nucleus, the density gradient is steep in sectors to the N and S, with
$\rho{\propto}r^{-1.5\pm0.1}$, and significantly shallower along the jet axis
to the E, where $\rho{\propto}r^{-0.93\pm0.07}$. The density structure within
the Bondi radius is therefore consistent with steady inflows perpendicular to
the jet axis and an outflow directed E along the jet axis. By putting limits on
the radial flow speed, we rule out Bondi accretion on the scale resolved at the
Bondi radius. We show that deprojected spectra extracted within the Bondi
radius can be equivalently fit with only a single cooling flow model, where gas
cools from 1.5 keV down below 0.1 keV at a rate of 0.03 M$_{\odot}$/yr. For the
alternative multi-temperature spectral fits, the emission measures for each
temperature component are also consistent with a cooling flow model. The lowest
temperature and most rapidly cooling gas in M87 is therefore located at the
smallest radii at ~100 pc and may form a mini cooling flow. If this cooling gas
has some angular momentum, it will feed into the cold gas disk around the
nucleus, which has a radius of ~80 pc and therefore lies just inside the
observed transition in the hot gas structure.

Velocity data recorded on-line at the target periphery during the HRMT-42

that the EG matrix can adapt to such deformation, which is a positive result.
The neutron tomography successfully revealed the internal state of the tantalum

particular in the downstream rods of the core. The possible origin of such
voids is discussed while future microstructure analysis after the target

baryon budget resides in large-scale filaments in the form of a diffuse plasma
at temperatures $T \sim 10^{5} - 10^{7}$ K. However, direct observation of this
so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) has been elusive. In the
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm, galaxy clusters correspond to the nodes of the cosmic
web at the intersection of several large-scale filamentary threads. In previous
work, we used HST/COS data to conduct the first survey of broad HI Ly$\alpha$
absorbers (BLAs) potentially produced by WHIM in inter-cluster filaments. We
targeted a single QSO, namely Q1410, whose sight-line intersects $7$
independent inter-cluster axes at impact parameters $<3$ Mpc (co-moving), and
found a tentative excess of a factor of ${\sim}4$ with respect to the field.
Here, we further investigate the origin of these BLAs by performing a blind
galaxy survey within the Q1410 field using VLT/MUSE. We identified $77$ sources
and obtained the redshifts for $52$ of them. Out of the total sample of $7$
BLAs in inter-cluster axes, we found $3$ without any galaxy counterpart to
stringent luminosity limits ($\sim 4 \times 10^{8}$ L$_{\odot}$ ${\sim} 0.01$
L$_{*}$), providing further evidence that these BLAs may represent genuine WHIM
detections. We combined this sample with other suitable BLAs from the
literature and inferred the corresponding baryon mean density for these
filaments in the range $\Omega^{\rm fil}_{\rm bar}= 0.02-0.04$. Our rough
estimates are consistent with the predictions from numerical simulations but
still subject to large systematic uncertainties, mostly from the adopted
geometry, ionization corrections and density profile.

Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) data to validate and inform cosmological parameter
estimation. When similar analysis tools are applied to both simulations and
real survey data, they provide powerful validation tests of the DES Y1
cosmological analyses presented in companion papers. We use two suites of
galaxy simulations produced using different methods, which therefore provide
independent tests of our cosmological parameter inference. The cosmological
analysis we aim to validate is presented in DES Collaboration et al. (2017) and
uses angular two-point correlation functions of galaxy number counts and weak
lensing shear, as well as their cross-correlation, in multiple redshift bins.
While our constraints depend on the specific set of simulated realisations
available, for both suites of simulations we find that the input cosmology is
consistent with the combined constraints from multiple simulated DES Y1
realizations in the $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ plane. For one of the suites, we are
able to show with high confidence that any biases in the inferred
$S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ and $\Omega_m$ are smaller than the DES Y1
$1-\sigma$ uncertainties. For the other suite, for which we have fewer
realizations, we are unable to be this conclusive; we infer a roughly 70%
probability that systematic biases in the recovered $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ are
sub-dominant to the DES Y1 uncertainty. As cosmological analyses of this kind
become increasingly more precise, validation of parameter inference using
survey simulations will be essential to demonstrate robustness.

training data. While some biases are beneficial for learning, others are
harmful. Specifically, image captioning models tend to exaggerate biases
present in training data (e.g., if a word is present in 60% of training
sentences, it might be predicted in 70% of sentences at test time). This can
lead to incorrect captions in domains where unbiased captions are desired, or
required, due to over-reliance on the learned prior and image context. In this
work we investigate generation of gender-specific caption words (e.g. man,
woman) based on the person's appearance or the image context. We introduce a
new Equalizer model that ensures equal gender probability when gender evidence
is occluded in a scene and confident predictions when gender evidence is
present. The resulting model is forced to look at a person rather than use
contextual cues to make a gender-specific predictions. The losses that comprise
our model, the Appearance Confusion Loss and the Confident Loss, are general,
and can be added to any description model in order to mitigate impacts of
unwanted bias in a description dataset. Our proposed model has lower error than
prior work when describing images with people and mentioning their gender and
more closely matches the ground truth ratio of sentences including women to
sentences including men. We also show that unlike other approaches, our model
is indeed more often looking at people when predicting their gender.

stall force to maintain the polymer fixed has been also calculated
independently, and its value confirms the force spectroscopy outcomes.

elucidating nonlinear, hierarchical representations of higher-order brain areas
during complex tasks, such as the production of speech by humans. Here, we
apply deep networks to predict produced speech syllables from cortical surface
electric potentials recorded from human sensorimotor cortex. We found that deep
networks had higher decoding prediction accuracy compared to baseline models,
and also exhibited greater improvements in accuracy with increasing dataset
size. We further demonstrate that deep network's confusions revealed
hierarchical latent structure in the neural data, which recapitulated the
underlying articulatory nature of speech motor control. Finally, we used deep
networks to compare task-relevant information in different neural frequency
bands, and found that the high-gamma band contains the vast majority of
information relevant for the speech prediction task, with little-to-no
additional contribution from lower-frequencies. Together, these results
demonstrate the utility of deep networks as a data analysis tool for
neuroscience.

have been performed with 'Sky Quality Meters' (SQMs). For some of the

we were able to find a correlation between light pollution and air pollution at
those stations. For all locations, we examined the circalunar periodicity of
the NSB, seasonal variations as well as long-term trends in the recorded light
pollution. For several remote locations, a darkening of the night sky due to
clouds by up to 1 magnitude is recorded - indicating a very low level of light
pollution -, while for the majority of the examined locations, a brightening of
the night sky by up to a factor of 15 occurs due to clouds. We present suitable
ways to plot and analyze huge long-term NSB datasets, such as mean-NSB
histograms, circalunar, annual ('hourglass') and cumulative ('jellyfish')
plots. We show that five of the examined locations reach sufficiently low
levels of light pollution - with NSB values down to 21.8 mag$_{SQM}$/arcsec$^2$
- as to allow the establishment of dark sky reserves. Based on the 'hourglass'
plots, we find a strong circalunar periodicity of the NSB in small towns and
villages (< 5.000 inhabitants), with amplitudes of of up to 5 magnitudes. Using
the 'jellyfish' plots, on the other hand, we demonstrate that the examined city
skies brighten by up to 3 magnitudes under cloudy conditions, which strongly
dominate in those cumulative data representations. The long-term development of
the night sky brightness was evaluated based on the 2012-17 data for one of our

introducing a new parameter that quantifies the deviation from general
relativity and depends on the model parameters. Since this parameter can be
expressed in terms of the scalar perturbation mode, a precise measurement of
its evolution could be used as an alternative way to impose constraints on

find unequivocally that $T_{ex}$ at 1665 MHz is greater than $T_{ex}$ at 1667
MHz. Our method exploits variations in the continuum emission from W5, and the
fact that the continuum brightness temperatures $T_C$ in this nebula are close
to the excitation temperatures of the OH lines in the foreground gas. The
result is that an OH line can appear in emission in one location and in
absorption in a neighboring location, and the value of $T_C$ where the profiles
switch from emission to absorption indicates $T_{ex}$. Absolute measurements of
$T_{ex}$ for the main lines were subject to greater uncertainty because of
unknown effects of geometry of the OH features. We also employed the
traditional ""expected profile"" method for comparison with our ""continuum
background"" method, and found that the continuum background method provided
more precise results, and was the one to definitively show the $T_{ex}$
difference. Our best estimate values are: $T^{65}_{ex} = 6.0 \pm 0.5$ K,
$T^{67}_{ex} = 5.1 \pm 0.2$ K, and $T^{65}_{ex} - T^{67}_{ex} = 0.9 \pm 0.5$ K.

formation and the three-phase interstellar medium (ISM) are self-consistently
regulated by gravity and stellar feedback. Synthetic CO maps are obtained by
post-processing the MHD simulations with chemistry and radiation transfer. We
find that CO is only an approximate tracer of H_2. On parsec scales, W_CO is
more fundamentally a measure of mass-weighted volume density, rather than H_2
column density. Nevertheless, $\langle X_\mathrm{CO}
\rangle=0.7-1.0\times10^{20}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}K^{-1}km^{-1}s}$ consistent with
observations, insensitive to the evolutionary ISM state or radiation field
strength if steady-state chemistry is assumed. Due to non-steady-state
chemistry, younger molecular clouds have slightly lower X_CO and flatter
profiles of X_CO versus extinction than older ones. The CO-dark H_2 fraction is
26-79 %, anti-correlated with the average extinction. As the observational beam
size increases from 1 pc to 100 pc, X_CO increases by a factor of ~ 2. Under
solar neighborhood conditions, X_CO in molecular clouds is converged at a
numerical resolution of 2 pc. However, the total CO abundance and luminosity

shale. The framework features a dual lattice system mimicking the mesostructure
of the material and simulates coupled mechanical and flow behavior. The
mechanical lattice model simulates the granular internal structure of shale and
describes heterogeneous deformation by means of discrete compatibility and
equilibrium equations. The network of flow lattice elements constitutes a dual
graph of the mechanical lattice system. A discrete formulation of mass balance
for the flow elements is formulated to model fluid flow along cracks. The
overall computational framework is implemented with a mixed explicit-implicit
integration scheme and a staggered coupling method that makes use of the dual
lattice topology enabling the seamless two-way coupling of the mechanical and
flow behaviors. The proposed model is used for the computational analysis of
shale fracture permeability behavior by simulating triaxial direct shear tests
on Marcellus shale specimens under various confining pressures. The simulated
mechanical response is calibrated against the experimental data, and the
predicted permeability values are also compared with the experimental
measurements. Furthermore, the paper presents the scaling analysis of both the
mechanical response and permeability measurements based on simulations
performed on geometrically similar specimens with increasing size. The
simulated stress-strain curves show a significant size effect in the post-peak
due to the presence of localized fractures. The scaling analysis of
permeability measurements enables prediction of permeability for large
specimens by extrapolating the numerical results of small ones.

automata (KCA) on quasiperiod lattices. In particular, we investigate phase
transition, magnetic entropy and propagation speed of the damage on these
lattices. Both the critical threshold parameter $p_{c}$ and the critical
exponents are estimated with good precision. In order to investigate the
increase of statistical fluctuations and the onset of chaos in the critical
region of the model, we have also defined a magnetic entropy to these systems.
It is seen that the magnetic entropy behaves in a different way when one passes
from the frozen regime ($p<p_{c}$) to the chaotic regime ($p>p_{c}$). For a
further analysis, the robustness of the propagation of failures is checked by
introducing a quenched site dilution probability $q$ on the lattices. It is
seen that the damage spreading is quite sensitive when a small fraction of the
lattice sites are disconnected. A finite-size scaling analysis is employed to
estimate the critical exponents. From these numerical estimates, we claim that
on both pure ($q=0$) and diluted ($q=0.05$) quasiperiodic lattices, the KCA
model belongs to the same universality class than on square lattices.
Furthermore, with the aim of comparing the dynamical behavior between periodic
and quasiperiodic systems, the propagation speed of the damage is also
calculated for the square lattice assuming the same conditions. It is found
that on square lattices the propagation speed of the damage obeys a power law
as $v\sim (p-p_{c})^{\alpha}$, whereas on quasiperiod lattices it follows a
logarithmic law as $v \sim \ln(p-p_{c})^\alpha$.

creating sets of evolving 3D models, the synthesized emission from which
matches the evolving observed emission. Here we investigate two contrasting

contained a single flare loop observed in both microwave and X-ray, and a more
complex flare, SOL2015-06-22T17:50, that contained at least four distinct

electrons in the dense and tenuous loops; however, both of which imply the
central role of resonant wave-particle interaction with turbulence. These

Automatic
detection of epileptic seizures can considerably improve the patients' quality

encounter many challenges in real-life situations. The EEGs are non-stationary
signals and seizure patterns vary across patients and recording sessions.
Moreover, EEG data are prone to numerous noise types that negatively affect the
detection accuracy of epileptic seizures. To address these challenges, we
introduce the use of a deep learning-based approach that automatically learns
the discriminative EEG features of epileptic seizures. Specifically, to reveal
the correlation between successive data samples, the time-series EEG data are
first segmented into a sequence of non-overlapping epochs. Second, Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to learn the high-level
representations of the normal and the seizure EEG patterns. Third, these
representations are fed into Softmax function for training and classification.
The results on a well-known benchmark clinical dataset demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed approach over the existing state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be robust in noisy and real-life
conditions. Compared to current methods that are quite sensitive to noise, the
proposed method maintains its high detection performance in the presence of
common EEG artifacts (muscle activities and eye-blinking) as well as white

the linear regime is preserved, while better following the non-linear
clustering of neutrinos on small scales. Massive neutrinos are split into
initially ""fast"" and ""slow"" components. The fast component is followed
analytically with the LRA all the way to redshift zero. The slow component is
evolved with the LRA only down to a switch-on redshift $z_\nu = 1$, below which
it is followed with the particle method, in order to fully account for its
non-linear evolution. The slow neutrino particles are initialized at $z = 99$
in order to have accurate positions and velocities at the switch-on time, but
are not used to compute the potential until $z \leq 1$, thus avoiding the worst
effect of particle shot noise. We show that our hybrid method matches (and for

exhibit an intrinsic Ising spin orbit coupling (SOC) along with a valley
contrasting Berry curvature, which can generate a purely anomalous spin and
valley Nernst signal driven by a thermal gradient. We show that a small
Bychkov-Rashba coupling, which is present in gated TMDs, can enhance the valley
Nernst signal by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude. We find that the Nernst
signal in these materials is dominated by the anomalous geometrical
contribution, and the conventional contribution is much weaker. Importantly,
the Nernst signal is also highly tunable by external gating. Although the total
Nernst signal vanishes due to time reversal (TR) symmetry, a small magnetic
coupling lifts the valley degeneracy and generates an amplified Nernst
response. Additionally, we also discuss the Nernst response of bilayer TMDs,
and show a similar enhancement and modulation of the Nernst signal due to
Rashba SOC. Our predictions are highly pertinent to ongoing experimental
studies in TMDs. The generated large anomalous Nernst signal can directly probe
the presence of a large Berry curvature in these materials, and may serve as a
promising tunable platform for caloritronics applications.

was confirmed as a gamma-ray emitter with Fermi/LAT, but it is uncertain
whether the gamma-ray emission region is the core or knots due to the low
spatial resolution of Fermi/LAT. We present an analysis of its Fermi/LAT data
in the past 9 years. Different from the radio and optical emission from the
core, it is found that the gamma-ray emission is steady without detection of
flux variation over 2 sigma confidence level. This likely implies that the
gamma-ray emission is from its knots. We collect the radio, optical, and X-ray
data of knot-A, the closest knot from the core at 1 arcsec, and compile its
spectral energy distribution (SED). Although the single-zone
synchrotron+SSC+IC/CMB model by assuming knot-A at rest can reproduce the SED
in the radio-optical-X-ray band, the predicted gamma-ray flux is lower than the
LAT observations and the derived magnetic field strength deviates the
equipartition condition with 3 orders of magnitude. Assuming that knot-A is
relativistically moving, its SED from radio to gamma-ray bands would be well
represented with the single-zone synchrotron+SSC+IC/CMB model under the
equipartition condition. These results likely suggest that the gamma-ray
emission may be from knot-A via the IC/CMB process and the knot should have
relativistical motion. The jet power derived from our model parameters is also
roughly consistent with the kinetic power estimated with the radio data.

approaches for developing classifier-based empirical trust sensor models are
presented that specifically use electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin

is used for feature extraction, feature selection, classifier training, and
model validation. The first approach considers a general set of
psychophysiological features across all participants as the input variables and
trains a classifier-based model for each participant, resulting in a trust
sensor model based on the general feature set (i.e., a ""general trust sensor
model""). The second approach considers a customized feature set for each
individual and trains a classifier-based model using that feature set,
resulting in improved mean accuracy but at the expense of an increase in
training time. This work represents the first use of real-time
psychophysiological measurements for the development of a human trust sensor.
Implications of the work, in the context of trust management algorithm design

assessment procedures for police and front-line agencies, better protect
victims of DV, and potentially prevent future re-occurrences of DV. Previous
work in DV recidivism has employed different classification techniques,
including decision tree (DT) induction and logistic regression, where the main
focus was on achieving high prediction accuracy. As a result, even the diagrams
of trained DTs were often too difficult to interpret due to their size and
complexity, making decision-making challenging. Given there is often a
trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability, in this work our aim is
to employ DT induction to obtain both interpretable trees as well as high
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we implement and evaluate different
approaches to deal with class imbalance as well as feature selection. Compared
to previous work in DV recidivism prediction that employed logistic regression,
our approach can achieve comparable area under the ROC curve results by using
only 3 of 11 available features and generating understandable decision trees
that contain only 4 leaf nodes.

his quest for a unified field theory informed his interpretation of GR. I show
that Einstein saw GR as a hybrid theory from very early on: fundamental and
correct as far as gravity was concerned but phenomenological and effective in
how it accounted for matter. As a result, Einstein saw energy-momentum tensors
and singularities in GR as placeholders for a theory of matter not yet
delivered. The reason he preferred singularities was that he hoped that their

pattern. During sweeping a mesh, computations on cells are strictly ordered by
data dependencies in given directions. Due to such a serial order,
parallelizing sweep is challenging, especially for unstructured and deforming
structured meshes. Meanwhile, recent high-fidelity multi-physics simulations of
particle transport, including nuclear reactor and inertial confinement fusion,
require {\em sweeps} on large scale meshes with billions of cells and hundreds
of directions.
  In this paper, we present JSweep, a parallel data-driven computational
framework integrated in the JAxMIN infrastructure. The essential of JSweep is a
general patch-centric data-driven abstraction, coupled with a high performance
runtime system leveraging hybrid parallelism of MPI+threads and achieving
dynamic communication on contemporary multi-core clusters. Built on JSweep, we
implement a representative data-driven algorithm, Sn transport, featuring
optimizations of vertex clustering, multi-level priority strategy and
patch-angle parallelism. Experimental evaluation with two real-world
applications on structured and unstructured meshes respectively, demonstrates
that JSweep can scale to tens of thousands of processor cores with reasonable

redundant gradients that are used by the parameter server to eliminate the

cluster jets and the bubbles they inflate cause the direction of later jets to
substantially change. Some uplifted cool clumps fall back to feed the active
galactic nucleus, in what is termed the cold feedback mechanism, but with an
average angular momentum that is largely inclined to that of the original jets.
The proposed jittering jets scenario allows, over the cooling time of the
intracluster medium (ICM), the heating by the mixing of hot jet-inflated bubble
gas with the ICM to operate in all directions. The proposed scenario further
supports the heating by mixing mechanism of the ICM. The feedback heating
mechanism of the ICM chiefly refers to the energy cycle. The cold feedback
mechanism introduces mass as another ingredient of the feedback cycle, as the
mass accretion of future activity cycles is determined by the formation of
perturbations by the present activity cycle. The jittering jets scenario that I
propose here brings angular momentum to be another ingredient of the feedback
cycle.

Major approximation approaches include pseudolikelihood and Laplace

likelihood function through first approximating the marginal likelihood
functions of individual parameters and then reconstructing the joint likelihood
function from these marginal likelihood functions. For approximating the
marginal likelihood functions, we derive a particular likelihood function from
a modified scenario of coin tossing which is useful for capturing how one
parameter interacts with the remaining parameters in the likelihood function.
For reconstructing the joint likelihood function, we use an appropriate copula
to link up these marginal likelihood functions. Numerical investigation
suggests the superior performance of our approach. Especially as the size of
the MRF increases, both the numerical performance and the computational cost of
our approach remain consistently satisfactory, whereas Laplace approximation
deteriorates and pseudolikelihood becomes computationally unbearable.

demonstrate a paucity (lower by $41\%\pm27\%$ on average) of weak X-ray sources
in most GCs relative to the field, which is represented by the Solar
neighborhood and Local Group dwarf elliptical galaxies. We also revisit the
mutual correlations among the cumulative X-ray luminosity ($L_X$), cluster mass
($M$) and stellar encounter rate ($\Gamma$), finding $L_{X}\propto M^{0.74\pm
0.13}$, $L_{X}\propto\Gamma^{0.67\pm0.07}$ and $\Gamma \propto M^{1.28 \pm

formation of CVs and ABs through stellar encounters in GCs is less dominant
than previously suggested, and that the primordial formation channel has a
substantial contribution. Taking these aspects together, we suggest that a
large fraction of primordial, soft binaries have been disrupted in
binary-single or binary-binary stellar interactions before they can otherwise
evolve into X-ray-emitting close binaries, whereas the same interactions also
have led to the formation of new close binaries. No significant correlations

This is one of the non-ideal MHD effects proposed to enable the formation of
Keplerian disks with sizes of tens of au. To observationally study ambipolar
diffusion in collapsing protostellar envelopes, we compare gas kinematics
traced by the H13CO+ (3-2) and C18O (2-1) lines in the Class 0 protostar B335
obtained with our ALMA observations. A central compact (~1""-2"") component that
is elongated perpendicular to the outflow direction and exhibits a clear
velocity gradient along the outflow direction is observed in both lines and
most likely traces the infalling flattened envelope. We constructed kinematical
models to fit the observed velocity structures and to measure the infalling
velocities of the ionized and neutral gas on a 100 au scale in B335. The
infalling velocities in the H13CO+ and C18O emission are both measured to be
0.85+/-0.2 km/s at a radius of 100 au, suggesting that the velocity drift
between the ionized and neutral gas is at most 0.3 km/s at a radius of 100 au.
The Hall parameter for H13CO+ is estimated to be >>1 on a 100 au scale in B335,
so that H13CO+ is expected to be attached to the magnetic field. Our
non-detection or upper limit of the velocity drift between ions and neutrals
could suggest that the magnetic field remains rather well coupled to the bulk
neutral material on a 100 au scale in this source, and that any significant
field-matter decoupling, if present, likely occurs only on a smaller scale,
leading to an accumulation of magnetic flux and thus efficient magnetic braking
in the inner envelope. However, because of our limited angular resolution, we
cannot rule out a significant ambipolar drift only in the midplane of the
infalling envelope. Future observations with higher angular resolutions (~0.1"")
are needed to examine this possibility and ambipolar diffusion on a smaller
scale.

supervision tightly integrates with the regression network to effectively (i)
localize keypoints using the ensemble of multi-scale features, and (ii) infer
global pose configuration by maximizing structural consistencies across
multiple keypoints and scales. The keypoint masking training enhances these
advantages to focus learning on hard occlusion samples. Our method achieves the

electron beams play an essential role for the production of high-level
non-thermal electron-cyclotron-emission (ECE) radiation. Most of the
non-thermal ECE comes from runaway electrons in the low-energy regime with
large pitch angle, which are strongly scattered by the excited whistler waves.
The power of ECE from runaway electrons is obtained using a synthetic
diagnostic model based on the reciprocity method. The electron distribution
function is calculated using a kinetic simulation model including the whistler
wave instabilities and the quasilinear diffusion effects. Simulations based on
DIII-D low-density discharge reproduces the rapid growth of the ECE signals
observed in DIII-D experiments. Unlike the thermal ECE where radiation for a
certain frequency is strongly localized inside the resonance region, the
non-thermal ECE radiation from runaway electrons is nonlocal, and the
emission-absorption ratio is higher than that of thermal electrons. The runaway
electron tail is more significant for ECE with higher frequencies, and the ECE
spectrum becomes flatter as RE population grows. The nonlinear behavior of the
kinetic instabilities is illustrated in the osculations of the ECE waves. The
good agreement with the DIII-D experimental observations after including the
kinetic instabilities clearly illustrate the significance of the scattering
effects from wave-particle interactions, which can also be important for
runaway electrons produced in disruptions.

and image segmentation, quantifies the cost of graph partitioning in a way that
biases clusters or segments that are balanced towards having lower values than
unbalanced partitionings. However, this bias is so strong that it avoids any
singleton partitions, even when vertices are very weakly connected to the rest
of the graph. Motivated by the B\""uhler-Hein family of balanced cut costs, we
propose the family of Compassionately Conservative Balanced (CCB) Cut costs,
which are indexed by a parameter that can be used to strike a compromise
between the desire to avoid too many singleton partitions and the notion that
all partitions should be balanced. We show that CCB-Cut minimization can be
relaxed into an orthogonally constrained $\ell_{\tau}$-minimization problem
that coincides with the problem of computing Piecewise Flat Embeddings (PFE)
for one particular index value, and we present an algorithm for solving the
relaxed problem by iteratively minimizing a sequence of reweighted Rayleigh
quotients (IRRQ). Using images from the BSDS500 database, we show that image
segmentation based on CCB-Cut minimization provides better accuracy with
respect to ground truth and greater variability in region size than NCut-based
image segmentation.

for its ability to selectively reduce CO$_2$ to CO with 45\% Faradaic
efficiency and a CO to H$_2$ ratio of 3:2. We employ density functional theory
(DFT) to determine the reasons behind the unusual catalytic properties of
\textbf{1} and the most likely mechanism for CO$_2$ reduction. The selectivity
for CO$_2$ over proton reduction is explained by analyzing the catalyst's
affinity for the possible ligands present under typical reaction conditions:
acetonitrile, water, CO$_2$, and bicarbonate. After reduction of the catalyst
by two electrons, formation of [Co$^\text{I}$N$_4$H]$^{+}$-CO$_{2}^{-}$ is
strongly favored. Based on thermodynamic and kinetic data, we establish that
the only likely route for producing CO from here consists of a protonation step
to yield [Co$^\text{I}$N$_4$H]$^{+}$-CO$_{2}$H, followed by reaction with
CO$_2$ to form [Co$^\text{II}$N$_4$H]$^{2+}$-CO and bicarbonate. This
conclusion corroborates the idea of a direct role of CO$_2$ as a Lewis acid to
assist in {C-O} bond dissociation, a conjecture put forward by other authors to
explain recent experimental observations. The pathway to formic acid is
predicted to be forbidden by high activation barriers, in accordance with the
products that are known to be generated by \textbf{1}. Calculated physical
observables such as standard reduction potentials and the turnover frequency
for our proposed catalytic cycle are in agreement with available experimental
data reported in the literature. The mechanism also makes a prediction that may
be experimentally verified: that the rate of CO formation should increase
linearly with the partial pressure of CO$_2$.

the energy within the Fourier measurement domain is distributed non-uniformly
is often neglected during reconstruction. As a result, more densely sampled
low-frequency information tends to dominate penalization schemes for
reconstructing MRI at the expense of high-frequency details. In this paper, we
propose a new framework for CS-MRI inversion in which we decompose the observed
k-space data into ""subspaces"" via sets of filters in a lossless way, and
reconstruct the images in these various spaces individually using off-the-shelf
algorithms. We then fuse the results to obtain the final reconstruction. In
this way we are able to focus reconstruction on frequency information within
the entire k-space more equally, preserving both high and low frequency
details. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods in CS-MRI in terms of quantitative performance, and
often improves an algorithm's results qualitatively compared with it's direct
application to k-space.

based on radiative hydrodynamic simulations in a flaring atmosphere. We employ
both a quiet-Sun atmosphere and a penumbral atmosphere as the initial one in
our simulations. We find that, in the quiet-Sun atmosphere, the line center is
obviously enhanced during an intermediate flare. The enhanced emission is
contributed from both radiative backwarming in the photosphere and particle
beam heating in the lower chromosphere. A blue asymmetry of the line profile
also appears due to an upward mass motion in the lower chromosphere. If we take
a penumbral atmosphere as the initial atmosphere, the line has a more
significant response to the flare heating, showing a central emission and an
obvious asymmetry. The low spectral resolution of HMI would indicate some loss
of information but the enhancement and line asymmetry are still kept. By
calculating polarized line profiles, we find that the Stokes I and V profiles
can be altered as a result of flare heating. Thus the distortion of this line
has a crucial influence on the magnetic field measured from this line, and one
should be cautious in interpreting the magnetic transients observed frequently

multitude of developmental processes at cellular and tissue levels. While it is
manifest that cells utilize both intracellular and intercellular mechanisms,
how the two produce the collective polarization remains an active area of
investigation. We study the role of intracellular interactions in the
large-scale spatial coherence of cell polarities, and scrutinize the role of
intracellular interactions in the emergence of tissue-wide polarization. We
demonstrate that nonlocal cytoplasmic interactions are necessary and sufficient
for the robust long-range polarization, and are essential to the faithful
detection of weak directional signals. In the presence of nonlocal
interactions, signatures of geometrical information in tissue polarity become
manifest. We investigate the deleterious effects of geometric disorder, and
determine conditions on the cytoplasmic interactions that guarantee the
stability of polarization. These conditions get progressively more stringent
upon increasing the geometric disorder. Another situation where the role of
geometrical information might be evident is elongated tissues. Strikingly, our
model recapitulates an observed influence of tissue elongation on the
orientation of polarity. Eventually, we introduce three classes of mutants:
lack of membrane proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, and local geometrical
irregularities. We adopt core-PCP as a model pathway, and interpret the model
parameters accordingly, through comparing the in silico and in vivo phenotypes.
This comparison helps us shed light on the roles of the cytoplasmic proteins in
cell-cell communication, and make predictions regarding the cooperation of
cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in long-range polarization.

the interactions with both the cluster and the nearby cluster member galaxies.
Most numerical studies, however, tend to focus on the effects of the former
with little work done on those of the latter. We thus perform a numerical study
on the evolution of a late-type galaxy interacting with neighboring early-type
galaxies at high speed, using hydrodynamic simulations. Based on the
information obtained from the Coma cluster, we set up the simulations for the
case where a Milky Way-like late-type galaxy experiences six consecutive
collisions with twice as massive early-type galaxies having hot gas in their
halos at the closest approach distances of 15-65 kpc/h at the relative
velocities of 1500-1600 km/s. Our simulations show that the evolution of the
late-type galaxy can be significantly affected by the accumulated effects of
the high-speed multiple collisions with the early-type galaxies, such as on
cold gas content and star formation activity of the late-type galaxy,
particularly through the hydrodynamic interactions between cold disk and hot
gas halos. We find that the late-type galaxy can lose most of its cold gas
after the six collisions and have more star formation activity during the
collisions. By comparing our simulation results with those of galaxy-cluster
interactions, we claim that the role of the galaxy-galaxy interactions on the
evolution of late-type galaxies in clusters could be comparable with that of
the galaxy-cluster interactions, depending on the dynamical history.

proposed millimeter-wave reconfigurable antenna architectures. To this end,
first we show that integration of the existing reconfigurable antenna systems
with the well-known non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique causes a
significant degradation in sum rate due to the inevitable power division in
reconfigurable antennas. To circumvent this fundamental limit, a new multiple
access technique is proposed. The technique which is called reconfigurable
antenna multiple access (RAMA) transmits only each user's intended signal at
the same time/frequency/code, which makes RAMA an inter-user interference-free
technique. Two different cases are considered, i.e., RAMA with partial and full
channel state information (CSI). In the first case, CSI is not required and
only the direction of arrival for a specific user is used. Our analytical
results indicate that with partial CSI and for symmetric channels, RAMA
outperforms NOMA in terms of sum rate. Further, the analytical result indicates
that RAMA for asymmetric channels achieves better sum rate than NOMA when less
power is assigned to users that experience better channel quality. In the
second case, RAMA with full CSI allocates optimal power to each user which
leads to higher achievable rates compared to NOMA for both symmetric and
asymmetric channels. The numerical computations demonstrate the analytical
findings.

strong interlayer coupling may be mainly responsible for this phenomenon,
especially in the fewer-layer region, and it could also be an essential factor
influencing other material properties of {\beta}-InSe and {\gamma}-InSe.
Existence of strong interlayer coupling manifests itself in three aspects: (i)
indirect-to-direct band gap transitions with increasing layer thickness; (ii)
fan-like frequency diagrams of the shear and breathing modes of few-layer

that multiple-layer InSe may be deserving of attention from FET-based

tackle such problems concerning LASSO, which is a widely used method for sparse

evolution phase when they are known to pulsate with varying amplitudes. The RSG
period-luminosity (PL) relation has been measured in the Milky Way, the
Magellanic Clouds and M33 for about 120 stars in total. Using over 1500 epochs
of R-band monitoring from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey over a

values of M_K for these stars, we derive the RSG PL relation in M31 and show
that it is consistent with those derived earlier in other galaxies of different
metallicities. We also detect, for the first time, a sequence of likely
first-overtone pulsations. Comparison to stellar evolution models from MESA

progenitors to Type II-P core-collapse supernovae (SNe), we also explore the
implication of their variability in the initial-mass estimates for SN

transmitter knows the values of directional angles of desired user and
eavesdropper, or their direction of arrival (DOAs) because the beamforming
vector of confidential messages and artificial noise (AN) projection matrix is
mainly determined by directional angles of desired user and eavesdropper. For a
DM transceiver, working as a receiver, the first step is to measure the DOAs of
desired user and eavesdropper. Then, in the second step, using the measured
DOAs, the beamforming vector of confidential messages and AN projection matrix
is designed. In this paper, we describe the DOA measurement methods, power
allocation, and beamforming in DM networks. A machine learning-based DOA
measurement method is proposed to make a substantial SR performance gain

inside the main beam of the desired user and may intercept the confidential

complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log\epsilon^{-1})$, which significantly
improves existing complexity bounds achieved by first-order I-AL methods for
finding an $\epsilon$-KKT solution. Our complexity analysis of the I-AL methods
is based on a sharp analysis of inexact proximal point algorithm (PPA) and the
connection between the I-AL methods and inexact PPA. It is vastly different
from existing complexity analyses of the first-order I-AL methods in the

extraction from complex-valued spectra. The proposed model, the complex-valued
restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM), is designed to deal with complex-valued
visible units as an extension of the well-known restricted Boltzmann machine
(RBM). Like the RBM, the CRBM learns the relationships between visible and
hidden units without having connections between units in the same layer, which
dramatically improves training efficiency by using Gibbs sampling or
contrastive divergence (CD). Another important characteristic is that the CRBM
also has connections between real and imaginary parts of each of the
complex-valued visible units that help represent the data distribution in the
complex domain. In speech signal processing, classification and generation
features are often based on amplitude spectra (e.g., MFCC, cepstra, and
mel-cepstra) even if they are calculated from complex spectra, and they ignore
phase information. In contrast, the proposed feature extractor using the CRBM
directly encodes the complex spectra (or another complex-valued representation
of the complex spectra) into binary-valued latent features (hidden units).
Since the visible-hidden connections are undirected, we can also recover
(decode) the complex spectra from the latent features directly. Our speech
coding experiments demonstrated that the CRBM outperformed other speech coding
methods, such as methods using the conventional RBM, the mel-log spectrum
approximate (MLSA) decoder, etc.

galaxies (DOGs) that are defined as (i-[22])_AB > 7.0. Because supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) in IR-bright DOGs are expected to be rapidly growing in the
major merger scenario, they provide useful clues for understanding the
co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However, the optical properties
of IR-bright DOGs remain unclear because the optical emission of a DOG is very
faint. By combining ~ 105 deg^2 images of the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR data
obtained from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey, the VISTA VIKING
survey, and the WISE all-sky survey, respectively, 571 IR-bright DOGs were
selected. We found that IR-bright DOGs show a redder (g-z)_AB color than other
populations of dusty galaxies, such as ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) at a
similar redshift, with a significantly large dispersion. Among the selected
DOGs, star-formation (SF) dominated DOGs show a relatively red color, while
active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated DOGs show a rather blue color in
optical. This result is consistent with the idea that the relative AGN
contribution in the optical emission becomes more significant at a later stage
in the major merger scenario. We discovered eight IR-bright DOGs showing a
significant blue excess in blue HSC bands (BluDOGs). This blue excess can be
interpreted as a leaked AGN emission that is either a directly leaking or a
scattered AGN emission, as proposed for some blue-excess Hot DOGs in earlier
studies.

mathematical problems against classical computers. Motivated by current rapid
experimental progress on quantum computing devices, various models of quantum
computation have been investigated to show quantum computational supremacy. At
a commercial side, quantum annealing machine realizes the quantum Ising model
with a transverse field and heuristically solves combinatorial optimization
problems. The computational power of this machine is closely related to
adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) with a restricted type of Hamiltonians,
namely stoquastic Hamiltonians, and has been thought to be relatively less
powerful compared to universal quantum computers. Little is known about
computational quantum speedup nor advantage in AQC with stoquastic
Hamiltonians. Here we characterize computational capability of AQC with
stoquastic Hamiltonians, which we call stoqAQC. We construct a concrete stoqAQC
model, whose lowest energy gap is lower bounded polynomially, and hence the
final state can be obtained in polynomial time. Then we show that it can
simulate universal quantum computation if adaptive single-qubit measurements in
non-standard bases are allowed on the final state. Even if the measurements are
restricted to non-adaptive measurements to respect the robustness of AQC, the
proposed model exhibits quantum computational supremacy; classical simulation
is impossible under complexity theoretical conjectures. Moreover, it is found
that such a stoqAQC model can simulate Shor's algorithm and solve the factoring
problem in polynomial time. We also propose how to overcome the measurement
imperfections via quantum error correction within the stoqAQC model and also an
experimentally feasible verification scheme to test whether or not stoqAQC is
done faithfully.

non-prehensile (e.g. pushing) and prehensile (e.g. grasping) actions: pushing
can help rearrange cluttered objects to make space for arms and fingers;
likewise, grasping can help displace objects to make pushing movements more
precise and collision-free. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to
discover and learn these synergies from scratch through model-free deep
reinforcement learning. Our method involves training two fully convolutional
networks that map from visual observations to actions: one infers the utility
of pushes for a dense pixel-wise sampling of end effector orientations and
locations, while the other does the same for grasping. Both networks are
trained jointly in a Q-learning framework and are entirely self-supervised by
trial and error, where rewards are provided from successful grasps. In this
way, our policy learns pushing motions that enable future grasps, while
learning grasps that can leverage past pushes. During picking experiments in
both simulation and real-world scenarios, we find that our system quickly
learns complex behaviors amid challenging cases of clutter, and achieves better
grasping success rates and picking efficiencies than baseline alternatives
after only a few hours of training. We further demonstrate that our method is
capable of generalizing to novel objects. Qualitative results (videos), code,

paper shows how to solve dynamic pricing by using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques so that prices are maximized while keeping a balance between revenue

fairness in dynamic pricing: on the one hand, RL is able to learn from recent
experience, adapting the pricing policy to complex market environments; on the
other hand, it provides a trade-off between short and long-term objectives,
hence integrating fairness into the model's core. Considering these two

follow a multivariate normal distribution and a link between two nodes forms if
the sum of the corresponding node parameters exceeds the latent variable. The
dependent structure among edges is induced by the covariance matrix of the
latent variables. The marginal distribution of an edge is a probit function. We
refer this model to as the \emph{Probit Network Model}. We show that the moment

outside the realm of biology. Undoubtedly, biological entities obey the

the physical foundation for understanding the origin and evolution of
complexity can be envisaged at the interface between the theory of frustrated
states resulting in pattern formation in glass-like media and the theory of
self-organized criticality (SOC). On the one hand, SOC has been shown to emerge
in spin glass systems of high dimensionality. On the other hand, SOC is often
viewed as the most appropriate physical description of evolutionary transitions
in biology. We unify these two faces of SOC by showing that emergence of
complex features in biological evolution typically if not always is triggered
by frustration that is caused by competing interactions at different
organizational levels. Competing interactions and frustrated states permeate
biology at all organizational levels and are tightly linked to the ubiquitous
competition for limiting resources. This perspective extends from the
comparatively simple phenomena occurring in glasses to large-scale events of
biological evolution, such as major evolutionary transitions. We therefore
submit that frustration caused by competing interactions in multidimensional
systems is the general driving force behind the emergence of complexity, within
and beyond the domain of biology.

function (MSF) has proven a particularly powerful tool for assessing the
stability of the synchronous state. Using tools from group theory this approach
has recently been extended to treat more general cluster states. However, the
MSF and its generalisations require the determination of a set of Floquet
multipliers from variational equations obtained by linearisation around a
periodic orbit. Since closed form solutions for periodic orbits are invariably
hard to come by the framework is often explored using numerical techniques.
Here we show that further insight into network dynamics can be obtained by
focusing on piecewise linear (PWL) oscillator models. Not only do these allow
for the explicit construction of periodic orbits, their variational analysis
can also be explicitly performed. The price for adopting such nonsmooth systems
is that many of the notions from smooth dynamical systems, and in particular
linear stability, need to be modified to take into account possible jumps in
the components of Jacobians. This is naturally accommodated with the use of
\textit{saltation} matrices. By augmenting the variational approach for
studying smooth dynamical systems with such matrices we show that, for a wide
variety of networks that have been used as models of biological systems,
cluster states can be explicitly investigated. By way of illustration we
analyse an integrate-and-fire network model with event-driven synaptic coupling
as well as a diffusively coupled network built from planar PWL nodes, including
a reduction of the popular Morris--Lecar neuron model. We use these examples to
emphasise that the stability of network cluster states can depend as much on
the choice of single node dynamics as it does on the form of network structural

the fractional Stokes Q and U parameters (qu-fitting). The systematic

Monte Carlo simulations. We find the unresolved core of 3C 273 to be 1.8%

multiple polarized components of different Faraday depth within our beam, or
internal Faraday rotation. With our limited wavelength coverage, we cannot
distinguish between the cases, and additional multifrequency and high angular
resolution observations are needed to determine the location and structure of
the magnetic field of the Faraday active region. Comparing our RM estimate with
values obtained at lower frequencies, the RM increases as a function of
observing frequency, following a power law with an index of ~2.0 consistent

resonance is formed by partially breaking a bound state in the continuum (BIC)
generated by the collective, vertical electric dipole resonances excited in the
nanopillars for sub-diffractive arrays. By opening an unprotected, diffractive
channel along one of the periods of the array one can control the
directionality of the emitted light without sacrificing the high Q associated
with the BIC mode, thus achieving directional lasing. A quality factor Q = 2750
is achieved at a controlled angle of emission of ~ 3 degrees with respect to
the normal of the array with a pumping fluence as low as 10 uJ/cm^2. We
demonstrate the possibility to control the lasing directivity and wavelength by
changing the geometrical parameters of the nanoantenna array, and by tuning the
gain spectrum of GaAs with temperature. Lasing action is demonstrated at
different wavelengths and emission at different angles, which can be as large

the zone boundary transverse optical phonon modes. In this work, we derive an
analytical expression of the Kohn anomaly parameter $\alpha_{\vec{K}}$ of these
phonons in graphene deformed by a uniaxial strain along the armchair direction.
We show that, the tilt of Dirac cones, induced by the strain, contributes to
the enhancement of the Kohn anomaly under a tensile deformation and gives rise
to a dominant contribution of the so-called {\it outer} intervalley mediated
phonon processes. Moreover, the Kohn anomaly is found to be anisotropic with
respect to the phonon wave vectors around the K point. This anisotropy may be
at the origin of the light polarization dependence of the Raman 2D band of the
strained graphene. Our results uncover, not only, the role of the Kohn anomaly

applied along the armchair and zigzag directions, but shed also light on the

two-step Aztec diamonds and similar shapes. We show that fluctuations of the
height function of a random dimer tiling on hedgehog discretizations of a
planar domain converge in the scaling limit to the Gaussian Free Field with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Interestingly enough, in this case the dimer
model coupling function satisfies the same Riemann-type boundary conditions as
fermionic observables in the Ising model. In addition, using the same
factorization of the double-dimer model coupling function as in [17], we show
that in the case of approximations by hedgehog domains the expectation of the
double-dimer height function is harmonic in the scaling limit.

these masks are used for single channel speech enhancement they severely
distort the speech signal and make them unsuitable for speech recognition. This
paper proposes a student-teacher learning paradigm for single channel speech
enhancement. The beamformed signal from multichannel enhancement is given as
input to the teacher network to obtain soft masks. An additional cross-entropy
loss term with the soft mask target is combined with the original loss, so that
the student network with single-channel input is trained to mimic the soft mask
obtained with multichannel input through beamforming. Experiments with the

Analysis (LDA) are amongst the most popular statistical learning techniques.
However, since their computation time increases cubically with the number of
features, they are inefficient in high-dimensional neuroimaging datasets.
Fortunately, for k-fold cross-validation, an analytical approach has been
developed that yields the exact cross-validated predictions in least-squares
models without explicitly training the model. Its computation time grows with
the number of test samples. Here, this approach is systematically investigated
in the context of cross-validation and permutation testing. LDA is used
exemplarily but results hold for all other least-squares methods. Furthermore,
a non-trivial extension to multi-class LDA is formally derived. The analytical
approach is evaluated using complexity calculations, simulations, and
permutation testing of an EEG/MEG dataset. Depending on the ratio between
features and samples, the analytical approach is up to 10,000x faster than the
standard approach (retraining the model on each training set). This allows for
a fast cross-validation of least-squares models and multi-class LDA in
high-dimensional data, with obvious applications in multi-dimensional datasets,
Representational Similarity Analysis, and permutation testing.

mean-field approximation of statistical physics to compute the posterior
disease probabilities for a given subset of observed signs (symptoms) in a
probabilistic model of signs and diseases. A Monte Carlo optimization algorithm
is then used to maximize an objective function of the sequence of observations,
which favors the more decisive observations resulting in more polarized disease
probabilities. We see how the observed signs change the nature of the
macroscopic (Gibbs) states of the sign and disease probability distributions.
The structure of these macroscopic states in the configuration space of the
variables affects the quality of any approximate inference algorithm (so the
diagnostic performance) which tries to estimate the sign/disease marginal
probabilities. In particular, we find that the simulation (or extrapolation) of
the diagnostic process is helpful when the disease landscape is not trivial and
the system undergoes a phase transition to an ordered phase.

the yrast state and non-yrast states can be varied on the same footing. The
orthogonality among the calculated states is automatically fulfilled by solving
the Hill-Wheeler equation. This avoids the complexity of the frequently used
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, as adopted by the excited VAMPIR method. Thanks
to the Cauchy's interlacing theorem in the matrix theory, the sum of the
calculated lowest projected energies with the same quantum numbers can be
safely minimized. Once such minimization is converged, all the calculated
energies and the corresponding states can be obtained, simultaneously. The
present VAP calculations are performed with time-odd Hartree-Fock Slater
determinants. It is shown that the calculated VAP energies (both yrast and
non-yrast) are very close to the corresponding ones from the full shell model
calculations. It looks the present algorithm is not limited to the VAP, but
should be universal, i.e., one can do the variation with different forms of the
many-body wavefunctions to calculate the excited states in different quantum
many-body systems.

magnetization parameter $\sigma_e$ and found that the large-amplitude precursor
waves are emitted for a wide range of $\sigma_e$. We found that especially at
low $\sigma_e$, the magnetic field generated by Weibel instability amplifies
the ordinary mode wave power. The amplitude is large enough to perturb the
upstream plasma, and transverse density filaments are generated as in the case
of the out-of-plane configuration investigated in the previous study. We
confirmed that our previous conclusion holds regardless of upstream magnetic

Machine learning has proved particularly useful to perform this task. Fully
automatized methods have recently gathered great popularity, even though those
methods often lack physical interpretability. In contrast, feature based
approaches can provide both well-performing models and understandable
causalities with respect to the correlations found between features and
physical processes. Efficient feature selection is an essential tool to boost
the performance of machine learning models. In this work, we propose a forward
selection method in order to compute, evaluate, and characterize better
performing features for regression and classification problems. Given the
importance of photometric redshift estimation, we adopt it as our case study.
We synthetically created 4,520 features by combining magnitudes, errors, radii,
and ellipticities of quasars, taken from the SDSS. We apply a forward selection
process, a recursive method in which a huge number of feature sets is tested
through a kNN algorithm, leading to a tree of feature sets. The branches of the
tree are then used to perform experiments with the random forest, in order to
validate the best set with an alternative model. We demonstrate that the sets
of features determined with our approach improve the performances of the
regression models significantly when compared to the performance of the classic
features from the literature. The found features are unexpected and surprising,
being very different from the classic features. Therefore, a method to
interpret some of the found features in a physical context is presented. The
methodology described here is very general and can be used to improve the
performance of machine learning models for any regression or classification

The ballistic regime occurs when electron-electron (e-e) scattering is weak

this difference, we find that vortices and a negative nonlocal resistance
believed to be quintessentially hydrodynamic are equally characteristic of the
ballistic regime. These non-Ohmic regimes cannot be distinguished in DC
transport without changing experimental conditions. Further, as our kinetic
calculations show, the hydrodynamic regime in DC transport is highly fragile
and is wiped out by even sparse disorder and e-ph scattering. We show that
microwave-frequency AC sources by contrast readily excite hydrodynamic modes
with current vortices that are robust to disorder and e-ph scattering. Indeed,
current reversals in the non-Ohmic regimes occur via repeated vortex generation
and mergers through reconnections, as in classical 2D fluids. Crucially, AC
sources give rise to strong correlations across the entire device that
unambiguously distinguish all regimes. These correlations in the form of
nonlocal current-voltage and voltage-voltage phases directly check for the
presence of a nonlocal current-voltage relation signifying the onset of
non-Ohmic behavior as well as also for the dominance of bulk interactions,
needed to confirm the presence of a hydrodynamic regime. We use these probes to
demarcate all regimes in an experimentally realizable graphene device and find
that the ballistic regime has a much larger extent in parameter space than the

accuracy of the depth estimation has been improved from conditional Markov
random fields, non-parametric methods, to deep convolutional neural networks
most recently. However, there exist inherent ambiguities in recovering 3D from
a single 2D image. In this paper, we first prove the ambiguity between the
focal length and monocular depth learning, and verify the result using
experiments, showing that the focal length has a great influence on accurate
depth recovery. In order to learn monocular depth by embedding the focal
length, we propose a method to generate synthetic varying-focal-length dataset
from fixed-focal-length datasets, and a simple and effective method is
implemented to fill the holes in the newly generated images. For the sake of
accurate depth recovery, we propose a novel deep neural network to infer depth
through effectively fusing the middle-level information on the
fixed-focal-length dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
built on pre-trained VGG. Furthermore, the newly generated varying-focal-length
dataset is taken as input to the proposed network in both learning and
inference phases. Extensive experiments on the fixed- and varying-focal-length
datasets demonstrate that the learned monocular depth with embedded focal
length is significantly improved compared to that without embedding the focal

Theoretically, it is widely accepted that short gamma-ray bursts can be
produced by two distinctly different mechanisms, binary neutron star mergers
and neutron star - black hole mergers. These two kinds of bursts should be
different observationally due to their different trigger mechanisms. Motivated
by this idea, we collect a universal data set constituted of 51 short gamma-ray
bursts observed by $Swift$/BAT, among which 14 events have extended emission
component. We study the observational features of these 51 events
statistically. It is found that our samples are consisted of two distinct
groups. They clearly show a bimodal distribution when their peak photon fluxes
at 15-150 keV band are plotted against the corresponding fluences. Most
interestingly, all the 14 short bursts with extended emission lie in a
particular region. When the fluences are plotted against the burst durations,
short bursts with extended emission again tend to concentrate in the long
duration segment. These features strongly indicate that short gamma-ray bursts
really may come from two distinct types of progenitors. We argue that those
short gamma-ray bursts with extended emission come from the coalescence of
neutron stars, while the short gamma-ray bursts without extended emission come
from neutron star - black hole mergers.

an increase in the vote-share variability of the equilibrium distributions. The
random heterogeneities in the external perturbations are shown to affect the
critical behavior of the network relative to networks without disorder. The
size of the shift in the critical behavior essentially depends on the total
fluctuation of the external influence disorder. Furthermore, the external
perturbation disorder also has the surprising effect of amplifying the expected
support of an already biased opinion. We show analytically that the vote-share
variability is directly related to the external influence fluctuations. We
extend our analysis by considering a fat-tailed multivariate lognormal

attacker typically tries to interfere with the system in the attempt to
increase its leakage of secret information. The defender, on the other hand,
typically tries to decrease leakage by introducing some controlled noise. This
noise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a
probabilistic choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of
leakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to the
attacker. In this work, we consider operators for modeling visible and hidden
choice in protocol composition, and we study their algebraic properties. We
then formalize the interplay between defender and attacker in a game-theoretic
framework adapted to the specific issues of QIF, where the payoff is
information leakage. We consider various kinds of leakage games, depending on
whether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether or not the
choices of the defender are visible to the attacker. In the case of sequential
games, the choice of the second player is generally a function of the choice of
the first player, and his/her probabilistic choice can be either over the
possible functions (mixed strategy) or it can be on the result of the function
(behavioral strategy). We show that when the attacker moves first in a
sequential game with a hidden choice, then behavioral strategies are more
advantageous for the defender than mixed strategies. This contrasts with the
standard game theory, where the two types of strategies are equivalent.
Finally, we establish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information
leakage and provide methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of
equilibrium) for both attacker and defender in the various cases.

dementia in the elderly, is characterized by multiple progressive impairments
in the brain structure and in clinical functions such as cognitive functioning
and functional disability. Until recently, these components were mostly studied
independently since no joint model for multivariate longitudinal data and time
to event was available in the statistical community. Yet, these components are
fundamentally inter-related in the degradation process towards dementia and
should be analyzed together. We thus propose a joint model to simultaneously
describe the dynamics of multiple correlated components. Each component,
defined as a latent process, is measured by one or several continuous markers
(not necessarily Gaussian). Rather than considering the associated time to
diagnosis as in standard joint models, we assume diagnosis corresponds to the
passing above a covariate-specific threshold (to be estimated) of a
pathological process which is modelled as a combination of the
component-specific latent processes. This definition captures the clinical
complexity of diagnoses such as dementia diagnosis but also benefits from
simplifications for the computation of Maximum Likelihood Estimates. We show
that the model and estimation procedure can also handle competing clinical
endpoints. The estimation procedure, implemented in a R package, is validated
by simulations and the method is illustrated on a large French population-based
cohort of cerebral aging in which we focused on the dynamics of three clinical
manifestations and the associated risk of dementia and death before dementia.

studies highlights the potential of these model membranes when addressing
questions in membrane biophysics and cell biology. Among them, phase
transitions and domain formation, dynamics and stability in raft-like mixtures
are probably some of the most intensively investigated. In doing so, many
research teams rely on standard protocols for GUV preparation and handling
involving the use of sugar solutions. Here, we demonstrate that following such
a standard approach can lead to abnormal formation of micron-sized domains in
GUVs grown from only a single phospholipid. The membrane heterogeneity is
visualized by means of a small fraction (0.1 mol%) of a fluorescent lipid dye.
For dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine GUVs, different types of membrane
heterogeneities were detected. First, an unexpected formation of micron-sized
dye-depleted domains was observed upon cooling. These domains nucleated about
10 K above the lipid main phase transition temperature, TM. In addition, upon
further cooling of the GUVs down to the immediate vicinity of TM, stripe-like
dye-enriched structures around the domains are detected. The micron-sized
domains in quasi single-component GUVs were observed also when using two other
lipids. Whereas the stripe structures are related to the phase transition of
the lipid, the dye-excluding domains seem to be caused by traces of impurities
present in the glucose. Supplementing glucose solutions with nm-sized liposomes
at millimolar lipid concentration suppresses the formation of the micron-sized
domains, presumably by providing competitive binding of the impurities to the
liposome membrane in excess. It is likely that such traces of impurities can
significantly alter lipid phase diagrams and cause differences among reported
ones.

the credibility of ""out of the blue"" findings without any prior support. A
significant result is deemed intrinsically credible if it is in conflict with a
sceptical prior derived from the very same data that would make the effect
non-significant. In this paper I propose to use Bayesian prior-predictive tail
probabilities to assess intrinsic credibility. For the standard 5% significance
level, this leads to a new p-value threshold that is remarkably close to the
recently proposed p<0.005 standard. I also introduce the credibility ratio, the
ratio of the upper to the lower limit of a standard confidence interval for the
corresponding effect size. I show that the credibility ratio has to be smaller
than 5.8 such that a significant finding is also intrinsically credible.
Finally, a p-value for intrinsic credibility is proposed that is a simple
function of the ordinary p-value and has a direct frequentist interpretation in
terms of the probability of replicating an effect.

engines powered by quantum non-thermal baths has been claimed to surpass the
thermodynamic Carnot bound. The key to understanding the performance of such
engines is a proper division of the energy supplied by the bath to the system
into heat and work, depending on the associated change in the system entropy

hybrid engines. Yet, they do not violate the principles of thermodynamics.
  An alternative means of boosting machine performance is the concept of
heat-to-work conversion catalysis by quantum non-linear (squeezed) pumping of
the piston mode. This enhancement is due to the increased ability of the
squeezed piston to store ergotropy. Since the catalyzed machine is fueled by
thermal baths, it adheres to the Carnot bound.

are on orbits that are closely aligned with the binary orbital plane, the
systems Kepler-413 and Kepler-453 exhibit small misalignments of $\sim
2.5^\circ$. One possibility is that these planets formed in a circumbinary disc
whose midplane was inclined relative to the binary orbital plane. Such a
configuration is expected to lead to a warped and twisted disc, and our aim is
to examine the inclination evolution of planets embedded in these discs. We
employed 3D hydrodynamical simulations that examine the disc response to the
presence of a modestly inclined binary with parameters that match the
Kepler-413 system, as a function of disc parameters and binary inclinations.
The discs all develop slowly varying warps, and generally display very small
amounts of twist. Very slow solid body precession occurs because a large outer
disc radius is adopted. Simulations of planets embedded in these discs resulted
in the planet aligning with the binary orbit plane for disc masses close to the
minimum mass solar nebular, such that nodal precession of the planet was
controlled by the binary. For higher disc masses, the planet maintains near
coplanarity with the local disc midplane. Our results suggest that circumbinary
planets born in tilted circumbinary discs should align with the binary orbit
plane as the disc ages and loses mass, even if the circumbinary disc remains
misaligned from the binary orbit. This result has important implications for
understanding the origins of the known circumbinary planets.

parallel programs on many-core architectures. Locks do not allow progress

synchronization, the drawbacks of locks are avoided by synchronizing access to
shared data by atomic read-modify-write operations. To incorporate non-blocking
synchronization in Ada~202x, programmers must be able to reason about the

fine-grained, optimistic synchronization mechanism. Synchronization is framed
by the semantics of concurrent entry execution. The programmer is only required

the approximation of fixed atoms, which assumes that atoms are fixed to their
equilibrium positions when light propagates in a medium and which is deeply
rooted in the conventional electrodynamics of continuous media. In many
photonic materials, the atoms carry the majority of the total momentum of light
and their motion also gives rise to net transfer of medium mass with a light
pulse. In this work, we use optoelastic continuum dynamics combining the
optical force field, elasticity theory, and Newtonian mechanics to analyze the
angular momentum carried by the MDW. We show that accounting for the MDW in the
analysis of the angular momentum gives for the field's share of the total
angular momentum of light a quantized value that is generally a fraction of
$\hbar$. In contrast, the total angular momentum of the mass-polariton (MP)
quasiparticle, which is a coupled state of the field and the MDW, and also the
elementary quantum of light in a medium, is an integer multiple of $\hbar$. The
same coupling is found for orbital and spin angular momentum components. The
physical picture of the angular momentum of light emerging from our theory is
fundamentally more general than earlier theoretical models, in which the total
angular momentum of light is assumed to be carried by the electromagnetic field
only or by an electronic polariton state, which also involves dipolar
electronic oscillations. These models cannot describe the MDW shift of atoms

accounted for by introducing a stochastic ""plastic disorder"" potential. This
scalar model is seen to be equivalent to a collection of Prandtl-Tomlinson
particles, which are coupled through an Eshelby quadrupolar kernel. Numerical
simulations of this scalar model reveal that the strain rate vs stress curve,
close to the critical stress, is of the form $\dot\gamma\sim
(\sigma-\sigma_c)^\beta$. Remarkably, we find that the value of $\beta$ depends
on details of the microscopic plastic potential used, confirming and giving
additional support to results previously obtained with the full tensorial
model. %\cite{Jagla_Yiel}. To rationalize this result, we argue that the
Eshelby interaction in the scalar model can be treated to a good approximation
in a sort of ""dynamical"" mean field, which corresponds to a Prandtl-Tomlinson
particle that is driven by the applied strain rate in the presence of a
stochastic noise generated by all other particles. The dynamics of this
Prandtl-Tomlinson particle displays different values of the $\beta$ exponent
depending on the analytical properties of the microscopic potential, thus
giving support to the results of the numerical simulations. Moreover, we find
that other critical exponents that depend on details of the dynamics show also
a dependence with the form of the disorder, while static exponents are
independent of the details of the disorder. Finally, we show how our scalar

gravitational wave. The features of such a signal provide extremely important
information about the physics of the early universe. In this paper, we focus on
several topics about warm inflation. First, we discuss the stability property
about warm inflation based on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which gives
more fundamental physical illustrations to thermal property of such model.
Then, we calculate the power spectrum of gravitational waves generated during
warm inflation, in which there are three components contributing to such
spectrum: thermal term, quantum term and cross term combining the both. We also
discuss some interesting properties about these terms and illustrate them in
different panels. As a model different from cold inflation, warm inflation
model has its individual properties in observational practice, so we finally
give a discussion about the observational effect to distinguish it from cold
inflation.

of $k$-inflation in the cold inflationary scenario, entropy perturbations
should be considered in our model. We study how the entropy perturbations
affect the evolution of curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ on the comoving
hypersurfaces and find the dissipation coefficient $\Gamma$ plays a central
role in the entropy perturbations and the evolution equation of $\mathcal{R}$.
In the weak dissipation condition, entropy perturbations on the large scale can
be neglected such that the primordial spectrum of cosmological perturbations is
due only to adiabatic perturbations. Like general warm inflationary models,
density fluctuations also mainly originated from the thermal fluctuations of
the inflaton field rather than the vacuum fluctuations in our model. Finally,
we calculate the perturbation spectra and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, then find
the tensor-to-scalar ratio is smaller than that in the $k$-inflation or the

universal, fixed feature extractors that, used as the first stage of any deep
network, work well for several tasks and domains simultaneously. Nevertheless,
such universal features are still somewhat inferior to specialized networks.
  To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose to consider instead
universal parametric families of neural networks, which still contain
specialized problem-specific models, but differing only by a small number of
parameters. We study different designs for such parametrizations, including
series and parallel residual adapters, joint adapter compression, and parameter
allocations, and empirically identify the ones that yield the highest
compression. We show that, in order to maximize performance, it is necessary to
adapt both shallow and deep layers of a deep network, but the required changes
are very small. We also show that these universal parametrization are very
effective for transfer learning, where they outperform traditional fine-tuning
techniques.

the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2012fr, which exploded in the Fornax cluster member
NGC 1365. These precise high-cadence light curves provide a dense coverage of
the flux evolution from $-$12 to $+$140 days with respect to the epoch of
$B$-band maximum (\tmax). Supplementary imaging at the earliest epochs reveals
an initial slow, nearly linear rise in luminosity with a duration of $\sim$2.5
days, followed by a faster rising phase that is well reproduced by an explosion
model with a moderate amount of $^{56}$Ni mixing in the ejecta. From an
analysis of the light curves, we conclude: $(i)$ explosion occurred $< 22$
hours before the first detection of the supernova, $(ii)$ the rise time to peak
bolometric ($\lambda > 1800 $\AA) luminosity was $16.5 \pm 0.6$ days, $(iii)$
the supernova suffered little or no host-galaxy dust reddening, $(iv)$ the peak
luminosity in both the optical and near-infrared was consistent with the bright
end of normal Type Ia diversity, and $(v)$ $0.60 \pm 0.15 M_{\odot}$ of
$^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. Despite its normal luminosity, SN
2012fr displayed unusually prevalent high-velocity \ion{Ca}{2} and \ion{Si}{2}
absorption features, and a nearly constant photospheric velocity of the
\ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 line at $\sim$12,000 \kms\ beginning $\sim$5 days
before \tmax. Other peculiarities in the early phase photometry and the
spectral evolution are highlighted. SN 2012fr also adds to a growing number of
Type Ia supernovae hosted by galaxies with direct Cepheid distance
measurements.

that the universe remains charge-neutral but the electron and proton numbers

an earlier decoupling of the baryon gas temperature from that of the CMB. This
implies a smaller ratio of the gas and CMB temperature at $z\sim 17$. The
parameter space of the mechanism where the 21 cm absorption signal is
significantly enhanced is probed by the CMB spectrum, cooling of stars and

vision tasks. However, existing object proposal generation methods often suffer
from the problems of motion blur, low contrast, deformation, etc., when they
are applied to video related tasks. In this paper, we propose an effective and
highly accurate target-specific object proposal generation (TOPG) method, which
takes full advantage of the context information of a video to alleviate these
problems. Specifically, we propose to generate target-specific object proposals
by integrating the information of two important objectness cues: colors and
edges, which are complementary to each other for different challenging
environments in the process of generating object proposals. As a result, the
recall of the proposed TOPG method is significantly increased. Furthermore, we
propose an object proposal ranking strategy to increase the rank accuracy of
the generated object proposals. The proposed TOPG method has yielded
significant recall gain (about 20%-60% higher) compared with several
state-of-the-art object proposal methods on several challenging visual tracking
datasets. Then, we apply the proposed TOPG method to the task of visual
tracking and propose a TOPG-based tracker (called as TOPGT), where TOPG is used
as a sample selection strategy to select a small number of high-quality target
candidates from the generated object proposals. Since the object proposals
generated by the proposed TOPG cover many hard negative samples and positive
samples, these object proposals can not only be used for training an effective
classifier, but also be used as target candidates for visual tracking.
Experimental results show the superior performance of TOPGT for visual tracking
compared with several other state-of-the-art visual trackers (about 3%-11%
higher than the winner of the VOT2015 challenge in term of distance precision).

tidal disruption events (TDEs). Since the resulting stellar debris can produce
an electromagnetic flare, TDEs are believed to probe the presence of single
SMBHs in galactic nuclei, which otherwise remain dark. In this paper, we show
how stars orbiting an IMBH secondary are perturbed by an SMBH primary. We find
that the evolution of the stellar orbits are severely affected by the primary
SMBH due to secular effects and stars orbiting with high inclinations with
respect to the SMBH-IMBH orbital plane end their lives as TDEs due to
Kozai-Lidov oscillations, hence illuminating the secondary SMBH/IMBH. Above a
critical SMBH mass of $\approx 1.15 \times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$, no TDE can occur
for typical stars in an old stellar population since the Schwarzschild radius
exceeds the tidal disruption radius. Consequently, any TDEs due to such massive
SMBHs will remain dark. It follows that no TDEs should be observed in galaxies
with bulges more massive than $\approx 4.15\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, unless
a lower-mass secondary SMBH or IMBH is also present. The secular mechanism for
producing TDEs considered here therefore offers a useful probe of
SMBH-SMBH/IMBH binarity in the most massive galaxies. We further show that the
TDE rate can be $\approx 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, and that most TDEs occur
on $\approx 0.5$ Myr. Finally, we show that stars may be ejected with
velocities up to thousands of km s$^{-1}$, which could contribute to the
observed population of Galactic hypervelocity stars.

Introduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally
high-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities.
Argon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the
purge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses
through materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact
with the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a
modulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These
impurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting
a 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in
DAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron
flux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a
seasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions
$^{40}\textrm{Ca}(\textrm{n,}\alpha)^{37}\textrm{Ar}$ and
$^{36}\textrm{Ar}(\textrm{n,}\gamma)^{37}\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is
also in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the
current DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the
resulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be
ionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting
in characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from
radon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to
a small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar
within the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test
through assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of
the DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation.

tradeoffs is of interest in the design of quantum repeater protocols. Here, we
present a number of methods to assess and optimize entanglement distillation
schemes. We start by giving a numerical method to compute upper bounds on the
maximum achievable fidelity for a desired probability of success. We show that
this method performs well for many known examples by comparing it to well-known
distillation protocols. This allows us to show optimality for many well-known
distillation protocols for specific states of interest. As an example, we
analytically prove optimality of the distillation protocol utilized within the

fibrant objects in the sense of Brown satisfying two additional properties and
as such provide a context in which one can interpret many notions from homotopy

can identify a class of discrete fibrations which is closed under push forward
along arbitrary fibrations (in other words, this class is polymorphic or closed
under impredicative quantification) and satisfies propositional resizing. This
class does not have a univalent representation, but if one restricts to those
discrete fibrations whose fibres are propositions in the sense of Homotopy Type
Theory, then it does. This means that, modulo the usual coherence problems, it
can be seen as a model of the Calculus of Constructions with a univalent type
of propositions. We will also build a more complicated path category in which
the class of discrete fibrations whose fibres are sets in the sense of Homotopy

Organic molecules are attractive for this application because they can have

generate a photon with high probability, a laser must excite the molecule
efficiently. We develop a simple model for that efficiency and discuss how to
optimise it. We demonstrate the validity of our model through experiments on a

the excitation probability cannot exceed 75\% at room temperature, but can
increase to over 99\% if the sample is cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature.
The possibility of high photon generation efficiency with only modest cooling

Fourier-modes of the periodic condensate and to expand the EAA in functional
Taylor-series around the periodic background. The RG flow equations are derived
in the next-to-next-to-leading order of the gradient expansion (GE). No
field-dependence of the derivative couplings have been taken into account and
$Z_2$ symmetry of the EAA is preserved. Preliminary numerical results have been
obtained under various additional simplifying assumptions. The characteristics
of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point and the phase structure of the model have been
determined numerically in the local potential approximation and in the
next-to-leading order of the GE, when the periodic condensate has been modelled
by a single cosine mode in one spatial direction. From the preliminary results
important information is gained on further possibilities to improve the

spatiotemporal trajectory of shape changes at the group level, and the
individual variations of this trajectory both in terms of geometry and time
dynamics. First, we formulate a non-linear mixed-effects statistical model as
the combination of a generic statistical model for manifold-valued longitudinal

finite-dimensional set of diffeomorphisms with a manifold structure, and an
efficient numerical scheme to compute parallel transport on this manifold.
Second, we introduce a MCMC-SAEM algorithm with a specific approach to shape

proposed to characterise the weight of forensic evidence using the Bayes factor

the magnitude of support is equally as important as determining which model is

likelihood-based inference impossible. In this paper, we use an Approximate
Bayesian Computation model selection algorithm to quantify the weight of
fingerprint evidence. We supplement the ABC algorithm using a Receiver

it easier to monitor convergence as the number of simulations increase. We use

for modelling the new flow of information $\mathbb G$ that incorporates both

this problem has been addressed by considering adaptive design methodology that
allows for the re-estimation of the required sample size during a trial. Here,
we propose and compare several approaches for this in multi-treatment crossover
trials. Specifically, regulators favour re-estimation procedures to maintain
the blinding of the treatment allocations. We therefore develop blinded
estimators for the within and between person variances, following simple or
block randomisation. We demonstrate that, provided an equal number of patients
are allocated to sequences that are balanced for period, the proposed
estimators following block randomisation are unbiased. We further provide a
formula for the bias of the estimators following simple randomisation. The
performance of these procedures, along with that of an unblinded approach, is
then examined utilising three motivating examples, including one based on a
recently completed four-treatment four-period crossover trial. Simulation
results show that the performance of the proposed blinded procedures is in many
cases similar to that of the unblinded approach, and thus they are an
attractive alternative.

interactions and communication in the digital world. Yet, surprisingly,
metadata are often still catergorized as non-sensitive. Indeed, in the past,
researchers and practitioners have mainly focused on the problem of the
identification of a user from the content of a message.
  In this paper, we use Twitter as a case study to quantify the uniqueness of
the association between metadata and user identity and to understand the
effectiveness of potential obfuscation strategies. More specifically, we
analyze atomic fields in the metadata and systematically combine them in an
effort to classify new tweets as belonging to an account using different
machine learning algorithms of increasing complexity. We demonstrate that
through the application of a supervised learning algorithm, we are able to
identify any user in a group of 10,000 with approximately 96.7% accuracy.
Moreover, if we broaden the scope of our search and consider the 10 most likely
candidates we increase the accuracy of the model to 99.22%. We also found that
data obfuscation is hard and ineffective for this type of data: even after
perturbing 60% of the training data, it is still possible to classify users
with an accuracy higher than 95%. These results have strong implications in
terms of the design of metadata obfuscation strategies, for example for data
set release, not only for Twitter, but, more generally, for most social media
platforms.

with no indication of an excess of emission at millimeter/sub-millimeter

the global emission curve is highly degenerate with the constituent curves
representing the sub-regions of M33. We also found gradients in
$T_\mathrm{dust}$ and $\beta_\mathrm{eff}$ across the disk of M33, with both
quantities decreasing with increasing radius. Comparing the M33 dust emissivity
with that of other Local Group members, we find that M33 resembles the
Magellanic Clouds rather than the larger galaxies, i.e., the Milky Way and M31.
In the Local Group sample, we find a clear correlation between global dust
emissivity and metallicity, with dust emissivity increasing with metallicity. A
major aspect of this analysis is the investigation into the impact of
fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) on the integrated flux
density spectrum of M33. We found that failing to account for these CMB
fluctuations would result in a significant over-estimate of $T_\mathrm{dust}$

for the inelastic cooling and maintain it in rapid conditions. Although in real

nanoscale measurements of the complete optical field vector. However, while it
was recently demonstrated that near-field scanning optical microscopy is
sensitive to the complete electromagnetic field, a separation of the different

robust algorithm that can disentangle all six electric and magnetic field
components from a single near-field measurement, without any numerical modeling

in greater detail than previously possible. A foreshock transient was detected
by THEMIS-B and C during 1535-1545 UT on June 25, 2008. THEMIS-A, D and E
observed magnetopause compression, cold plasma enhancement and ULF waves in the
dayside magnetosphere. The all-sky imager (ASI) at South Pole observed that
both diffuse and discrete aurora brightened locally soon after the appearance
of this foreshock transient. The diffuse aurora brightening, which corresponded
to a region a few Re size in GSM-Y in the equatorial plane, propagated duskward
with an average speed of ~100 km/s. Soon after the diffuse aurora brightened,
discrete aurora also brightened and extended duskward, which was consistent
with the motion of the foreshock transient as it swept through the
magnetosheath while impacting the magnetopause. Equivalent horizontal currents
measured by magnetometers revealed a pair of field-aligned currents (FACs)
moving duskward consistent with motion of the discrete aurora patterns. We
conclude that the high-resolution and two-dimensional observation of auroral
responses by ground-based ASI can help to estimate the evolution and
propagation of upstream foreshock transients and their substantial impacts on
the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system, including magnetospheric

tools for solving combinatorial and nonconvex problems. For example, they are
the foremost method for solving (mixed) integer programs and constraint
satisfaction problems. Tree search algorithms recursively partition the search
space to find an optimal solution. In order to keep the tree size small, it is
crucial to carefully decide, when expanding a tree node, which question
(typically variable) to branch on at that node in order to partition the
remaining space. Numerous partitioning techniques (e.g., variable selection)
have been proposed, but there is no theory describing which technique is
optimal. We show how to use machine learning to determine an optimal weighting
of any set of partitioning procedures for the instance distribution at hand
using samples from the distribution. We provide the first sample complexity
guarantees for tree search algorithm configuration. These guarantees bound the
number of samples sufficient to ensure that the empirical performance of an
algorithm over the samples nearly matches its expected performance on the
unknown instance distribution. This thorough theoretical investigation
naturally gives rise to our learning algorithm. Via experiments, we show that
learning an optimal weighting of partitioning procedures can dramatically
reduce tree size, and we prove that this reduction can even be exponential.
Through theory and experiments, we show that learning to branch is both

is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Despite the great achievements of the
past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction
still appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments
characterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness,
modern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts
and long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the
study of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in
processing speech signals.
  In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out
to be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First,
we analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant
redundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the
former from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate
model. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with ReLU activations.
This variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model
learn long-term dependencies without numerical issues.
  Results show that the proposed architecture, called Light GRU (Li-GRU), not
only reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30% over a standard GRU,
but also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks,
input features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms,
ranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end CTC models.

hand-specified rewards. To design such problems, developers of learning
algorithms must inherently be aware of what the task goals are, yet we often
require agents to discover them on their own without any supervision beyond
these sparse rewards. While much of the power of reinforcement learning derives
from the concept that agents can learn with little guidance, this requirement
greatly burdens the training process. If we relax this one restriction and
endow the agent with knowledge of the reward function, and in particular of the
goal, we can leverage backwards induction to accelerate training. To achieve
this, we propose training a model to learn to take imagined reversal steps from
known goal states. Rather than training an agent exclusively to determine how
to reach a goal while moving forwards in time, our approach travels backwards
to jointly predict how we got there. We evaluate our work in Gridworld and
Towers of Hanoi and empirically demonstrate that it yields better performance

neural network by backpropagating observed errors. However, neural network
architectures are growing increasingly sophisticated and diverse, which
motivates an emerging quest for even more general forms of differentiable

reverse-mode form of AD that generalizes backpropagation in neural networks.
  We uncover a tight connection between reverse-mode AD and delimited
continuations, which permits implementing reverse-mode AD purely via operator
overloading and without any auxiliary data structures. We further show how this
formulation of AD can be fruitfully combined with multi-stage programming
(staging), leading to a highly efficient implementation that combines the
performance benefits of deep learning frameworks based on explicit reified
computation graphs (e.g., TensorFlow) with the expressiveness of pure library

(DM) is coupled to photons, inducing a nonconservation of the numbers of
particles for both species, where the DM particles are allowed to dilute
throughout the cosmic history with a small deviation from the standard
evolution decaying into photons, while the associated scattering processes are
assumed to be negligible. In addition, we consider the presence of massive
neutrinos with the effective number of species $N_{\rm eff}$ as a free
parameter. The effects of the DM-photon coupling on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) and matter power spectra are analyzed. We derive the
observational constraints on the model parameters by using the data from CMB,
baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the recently measured new
local value of the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope, and large
scale structure (LSS) information from the abundance of galaxy clusters. The
DM-photon coupling parameter $\Gamma_{\gamma }$ is constrained to
$\Gamma_{\gamma } \leq 1.3 \times10^{-5}$ (at 95\% C.L.) from the joint
analysis carried out by using all the mentioned data sets. The neutrino mass
scale $\sum m_{\nu}$ upper bounds at 95\% C.L. are obtained as $\sum m_{\nu}
\sim 0.9$ eV and $\sum m_{\nu} \sim 0.4$ eV with and without the LSS data,
respectively. We observe that the DM-photon coupling cause significant changes
in the best fit value of $N_{\rm eff}$ but yields statistical ranges of $N_{\rm
eff}$ compatible with the standard predictions, and we do not find any evidence
of dark radiation. Due to nonconservation of photons in our model, we also
evaluate and analyze the effects on the BAO acoustic scale at the drag epoch.
The DM-photon coupling model yields high values of Hubble constant consistent
with the local measurement, and thus alleviates the tension on this parameter.

studies we have improved on both statistical and systematic errors. Using the
SF coupling to implicitly define a reference scale $1/L_0\approx 4$ GeV through
$\bar{g}^2(L_0) =2.012$, we quote $L_0 \Lambda^{N_{\rm f}=3}_{\overline{\rm

remnant perturbative uncertainty is negligible and very well controlled, by
connecting to infinite renormalization scale from different scales $2^n/L_0$
for $n=0,1,\ldots,5$. An intermediate step in this connection may involve any
member of a one-parameter family of SF couplings. This provides an excellent
opportunity for tests of perturbation theory some of which have been published

the truncation error requires non-perturbative data for a sufficiently large
range of values of $\alpha_s=\bar{g}^2/(4\pi)$. In the present work we reach

predictions for short clips, which are then pooled heuristically to assign an
action label to the full video segment. As not all frames may characterize the
underlying action---indeed, many are common across multiple actions---pooling
schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable. In an
attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the
notion that among the deep features generated on all short clips, there is at
least one that characterizes the action. To this end, we learn a (nonlinear)
hyperplane that separates this unknown, yet discriminative, feature from the
rest. Applying multiple instance learning in a large-margin setup, we use the
parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the full video
segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in
a max-margin framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the
features. We formulate a joint objective and an efficient solver that learns
these hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers over the
hyperplanes. Our pooling scheme is end-to-end trainable within a deep
framework. We report results from experiments on three benchmark datasets
spanning a variety of challenges and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across these tasks.

for some self-discipline. Clearly there is an opportunity to replace humans,
but there are better opportunities, as we have discovered to fit cognitive
abilities of human and non-humans. We performed one of the first studies in
radiology to see how human and AI performance can complement and improve each
others performance for detecting pneumonia in chest X-rays. We question if
there is a practical wisdom or phronesis that we need to demonstrate in AI
today as well as in our field. Using this, we articulate what AI as a field has
already and probably can in the future learn from Psychology, Cognitive
Science, Sociology and Science and Technology Studies.

  Convolutional Neural Networks and Data Augmentation","22 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recognition of coral species based on underwater texture images pose a
significant difficulty for machine learning algorithms, due to the three
following challenges embedded in the nature of this data: 1) datasets do not
include information about the global structure of the coral; 2) several species
of coral have very similar characteristics; and 3) defining the spatial borders
between classes is difficult as many corals tend to appear together in groups.
For this reason, the classification of coral species has always required an aid
from a domain expert. The objective of this paper is to develop an accurate
classification model for coral texture images. Current datasets contain a large
number of imbalanced classes, while the images are subject to inter-class
variation. We have analyzed 1) several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures, 2) data augmentation techniques and 3) transfer learning. We
have achieved the state-of-the art accuracies using different variations of
ResNet on the two current coral texture datasets, EILAT and RSMAS.

In
this paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose
complementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain
from T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The
proposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and
have two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its
complementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway
extracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to
brain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training
dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on
the OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the
two-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is
verified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its
invariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network
design is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation
problems with better generalization.

  Domain Adaptation","Accepted to Interspeech 2018",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation plays an important role for speech recognition models, in
particular, for domains that have low resources. We propose a novel generative
model based on cyclic-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for
unsupervised non-parallel speech domain adaptation. The proposed model employs
multiple independent discriminators on the power spectrogram, each in charge of
different frequency bands. As a result we have 1) better discriminators that
focus on fine-grained details of the frequency features, and 2) a generator
that is capable of generating more realistic domain-adapted spectrogram. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on speech recognition with gender
adaptation, where the model only has access to supervised data from one gender
during training, but is evaluated on the other at test time. Our model is able
to achieve an average of $7.41\%$ on phoneme error rate, and $11.10\%$ word
error rate relative performance improvement as compared to the baseline, on
TIMIT and WSJ dataset, respectively. Qualitatively, our model also generates
more natural sounding speech, when conditioned on data from the other domain.

In reality space will probably be of a uniform character and the present theory

Randers metric with a real valued scalar field and complex valued vector field,
providing a unified mathematical framework for gravitation & electromagnetism
for which the resulting theory's predictions agree with General Relativity; to
leading order in the gravitational constant. Hence, the related experimental
results validate both theories; and the former theory's metric solutions are
free of spurious singularities, because its stress-energy tensor includes the
energy & momentum for the gravitational field; like e.g. Maxwell's
stress-energy tensor contains the electromagnetic field.

made possible by the availability of localization technologies providing
