near-field enhancement, the result is an ultrafast, sub-diffraction, coherent
light source tunable between 3 and 5 micrometer wavelength on a silicon

high-power femtosecond laser system equipped with parametric frequency
conversion in combination with an all-reflective confocal microscope setup is
employed. We show spatially resolved maps of the linear scattering cross

clear third order power dependence as well as the mid-infrared emission spectra
prove the nonlinear nature of the light emission. Simulations support the
observed resonance length of the double rod antenna and demonstrate that the
field enhancement inside the antenna material is responsible for the nonlinear
frequency mixing.

exceed the far-field limit set by Planck's law due to the evanescent wave

subwavelength distances. We show that the RHT between two SiC nanoparticles

exceed the far-field limit when the particles are located within a
subwavelength distance away from a SiC substrate. In this configuration, the
localized surface phonon polariton (SPhP) of the particles couples to the
propagating SPhP of the substrate which then provides a new channel for the
near-field energy transport and enhances the RHT by orders of magnitude at
large distances. The enhancement is also demonstrated to appear in a chain of
closely spaced SiC nanoparticles located in the near field of a SiC substrate.
The findings provide a new way for the long-distance transport of near-field

both the coupling schemes on the low-energy effective $t-J$ model and calculate
the angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) spectra using self-consistent Born

mortality in Game of Thrones (GoT). Design and Setting: A longitudinal cohort
study in the fictional kingdom of Westeros and Essos. Participants: All the
characters appearing in the GoT since airing of its first episode with screen
time of greater than or equal to 5 minutes. Main Outcome Measures: All-cause
mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the
risk factors associated with mortality, represented by hazard ratios, with
episodes as the unit of time. Results: Of the 132 characters, followed up for a
median time of 32 episodes, a total 89 (67.4%) characters died; with external
invasive injury as the most common cause of death, attributing to 42.4% of the
total deaths. Age (in decades) was a significant risk factor for death [HR,
1.24 (95% CI, 1.08-1.43), P=0.0001]. Although statistically non-significant,
allegiance to house Targaryen [HR, 1.10 (95% CI, 0.32-3.77)] was associated
with a higher risk for mortality per episode than house Stark. Characters
residing in South were less likely to die than characters residing in North
[HR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.29-1.16), P=0.12]. Advisors showed a lower risk of
mortality than the members of houses, with some statistical significance [HR,
0.39 (95% CI, 0.14-1.08), P=0.07]. Conclusions: There is a high mortality rate
among the characters in GoT. Residing in the North and being a member of a
house is very dangerous in GoT. Allegiance to house Stark trended to be safer
than house Targaryen.

The
decision maker often needs to choose a contextual item at each step from a set
of candidates. Contextual bandit algorithms have been successfully deployed to
such applications, for the trade-off between exploration and exploitation and
the state-of-art performance on minimizing online costs. However, the
applicability of existing contextual bandit methods is limited by the
over-simplified assumptions of the problem, such as assuming a simple form of
the reward function or assuming a static environment where the states are not
affected by previous actions. In this work, we put forward Policy Gradients for
Contextual Recommendations (PGCR) to solve the problem without those
unrealistic assumptions. It optimizes over a restricted class of policies where
the marginal probability of choosing an item (in expectation of other items)
has a simple closed form, and the gradient of the expected return over the
policy in this class is in a succinct form. Moreover, PGCR leverages two useful
heuristic techniques called Time-Dependent Greed and Actor-Dropout. The former
ensures PGCR to be empirically greedy in the limit, and the latter addresses
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation by using the policy network
with Dropout as a Bayesian approximation. PGCR can solve the standard
contextual bandits as well as its Markov Decision Process generalization.
Therefore it can be applied to a wide range of realistic settings of
recommendations, such as personalized advertising. We evaluate PGCR on toy
datasets as well as a real-world dataset of personalized music recommendations.
Experiments show that PGCR enables fast convergence and low regret, and
outperforms both classic contextual-bandits and vanilla policy gradient
methods.

with multi-agent-based computational models based on the microscopic theory of
electrical conduction, can enable 5th grade and 7th students to develop a deep
understanding of electric current as an emergent process of flow in terms of
its microscopic level entities and their attributes, by bootstrapping their
repertoire of intuitive knowledge. We present a particular design strategy -
representing electric current as a fictive and transient process of charge
accumulation, without falling in previously reported traps of the ""source sink""
mental models - and show how this strategy was effectively implemented in the
computational model as well as in the learning activities performed by the

using phone numbers has recently become prevalent on OSNs, where spammers
advertise phone numbers to attract users' attention and convince them to make a
call to these phone numbers. The dynamics of phone number based spam is
different from URL-based spam due to an inherent trust associated with a phone
number. While previous work has proposed strategies to mitigate URL-based spam
attacks, phone number based spam attacks have received less attention. In this
paper, we aim to detect spammers that use phone numbers to promote campaigns on
Twitter. To this end, we collected information about 3,370 campaigns spread by
670,251 users. We model the Twitter dataset as a heterogeneous network by
leveraging various interconnections between different types of nodes present in
the dataset. In particular, we make the following contributions: (i) We propose
a simple yet effective metric, called Hierarchical Meta-Path Score (HMPS) to
measure the proximity of an unknown user to the other known pool of spammers.
(ii) We design a feedback-based active learning strategy and show that it
significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art baselines for the task of spam
detection. Our method achieves 6.9% and 67.3% higher F1-score and AUC,
respectively compared to the best baseline method. (iii) To overcome the
problem of less training instances for supervised learning, we show that our
proposed feedback strategy achieves 25.6% and 46% higher F1-score and AUC
respectively than other oversampling strategies. Finally, we perform a case
study to show how our method is capable of detecting those users as spammers
who have not been suspended by Twitter (and other baselines) yet.

encircling the exceptional points and can only take integers. We further find
that the difference of $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ is related to the second winding
number or energy vorticity. By applying our scheme to a non-Hermitian
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and an extended version of it, we show that the
topologically different phases can be well characterized by winding numbers.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existence of left and right zero-mode edge
states is closely related to the winding number $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$.

master actions in a simple manner. We determine the assembly of the string

solutions to the master equation defined by Dirac antibrackets on the
constrained string field-antifield space. It is expected that partially
gauge-fixing enables us to relate superstring field theories based on the large

rather natural from this point of view. Finally, inspired by these results, we
revisit the conventional BV approach and construct a BV master action based on

assigned fractions (subtasks) of a computational task in order to perform the
computation in parallel. In this setting, a well-known main bottleneck has been
the inter-node communication cost required to parallelize the task, because
unlike the computational cost which could keep decreasing as $K$ increases, the
communication cost remains approximately constant, thus bounding the total
speedup gains associated to having more computing nodes. This bottleneck was
substantially ameliorated by the recent introduction of coded MapReduce
techniques which allowed each node --- at the computational cost of having to
preprocess approximately $t$ times more subtasks --- to reduce its
communication cost by approximately $t$ times. In reality though, the
associated speed up gains were severely limited by the requirement that larger
$t$ and $K$ necessitated that the original task be divided into an extremely
large number of subtasks. In this work we show how node cooperation, along with
a novel assignment of tasks, can help to dramatically ameliorate this
limitation. The result applies to wired as well as wireless distributed
computing, and it is based on the idea of having groups of nodes compute
identical parallelization (mapping) tasks and then employing a here-proposed
novel D2D coded caching algorithm.

evaluate the approach in the context of SAT-based model checking for both the

non-thermal emission of pulsars above 1 keV. With just four physical
parameters, we fit the spectrum of the gamma/X-ray pulsars along seven orders
of magnitude. We find that all detections can be encompassed in a continuous
variation of the model parameters, and pose that their values could likely
relate to the closure mechanism operating in the accelerating region. The model
explains the appearance of sub-exponential cutoffs at high energies as a
natural consequence of synchro-curvature dominated losses, unveiling that
curvature-only emission may play a relatively minor role --if any-- in the
spectrum of most pulsars. The model also explains the flattening of the X-ray
spectra at soft energies as a result of propagating particles being subject to
synchrotron losses all along their trajectories. Using this model, we show how
observations in gamma-rays can predict the detectability of the pulsar in
X-rays, and viceversa.

periods ranging from a fraction of a second to several minutes. These
oscillations are referred to as quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), to emphasise
that they often contain apparent amplitude and period modulation. We review the
current understanding of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares.
In particular, we focus on the possible physical mechanisms, with an emphasis
on the underlying physics that generates the resultant range of periodicities.
These physical mechanisms include MHD oscillations, self-oscillatory
mechanisms, oscillatory reconnection/reconnection reversal, wave-driven
reconnection, two loop coalescence, MHD flow over-stability, the equivalent
LCR-contour mechanism, and thermal-dynamical cycles. We also provide a

occurrence of QPPs puts additional constraints on the interpretation and
understanding of the fundamental processes operating in flares, e.g. magnetic
energy liberation and particle acceleration. Therefore, a full understanding of
QPPs is essential in order to work towards an integrated model of solar and

applications to processes with only modest separations of timescales. Here we

MRIM problem models the viral marketing scenarios in which advertisers conduct

$1-e^{-(1-1/e)}-\varepsilon \approx 0.46 - \varepsilon$ approximation ratio but

theoretical predictions must also be computed to an equally high level of
precision. In this work we investigate the impact on such predictions of
relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions often used in these computations.
In particular, we investigate the importance of slow-roll corrections in the
computation of multi-field inflation observables, such as the amplitude of the
scalar spectrum $P_\zeta$, its spectral tilt $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio
$r$ and the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$. To this end we use the separate
universes approach and $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to consider
slow-roll corrections to the non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature
perturbation as well as corrections to its two-point statistics. In the context
of the $\delta N$ expansion, we divide slow-roll corrections into two
categories: those associated with calculating the correlation functions of the
field perturbations on the initial flat hypersurface and those associated with
determining the derivatives of the e-folding number with respect to the field
values on the initial flat hypersurface. Using the results of Nakamura &
Stewart '96, corrections of the first kind can be written in a compact form.
Corrections of the second kind arise from using different levels of slow-roll
approximation in solving for the super-horizon evolution, which in turn
corresponds to using different levels of slow-roll approximation in the
background equations of motion. We consider four different levels of
approximation and apply the results to a few example models. The various
approximations are also compared to exact numerical solutions.

that the corresponding dynamics is characterized by memory effects that slowly
decay in time. Motivated by this we construct non-Markovian lattice-gas

respectively. Except in the vicinity of the tangent point, the kinematic
distance uncertainties derived by Method C are smaller than those of Methods A

constrain both the distances and the Galactocentric positions of HMSFRs more
accurately than parallax distances. Beyond the tangent point along longitude=30

posing it as a binary classification task of classifying all images in the

method combines active learning with graph-based semi-supervised learning
(GSSL) to tackle this problem. Active learning reduces the number of user
interactions by querying the labels of the most informative points and GSSL
allows to use abundant unlabeled data along with the limited labeled data
provided by the user. To efficiently find the most informative point, we use an
uncertainty sampling based method that queries the label of the point nearest
to the decision boundary of the classifier. We estimate this decision boundary
using our heuristic of adaptive threshold. To utilize huge volumes of unlabeled
data we use an efficient approximation based method that reduces the complexity
of GSSL from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$, making GSSL scalable. We make the classifier
robust to the diversity and noisy labels associated with images in large
databases by incorporating information from multiple modalities such as visual
information extracted from deep learning based models and semantic information
extracted from the WordNet. High F1 scores within few relevance feedback rounds

challenges in robot motion planning. By decomposing nonlinear dynamics into a
discrete set of local dynamics models, hybrid dynamics provide a natural way to
model nonlinear dynamics, especially in systems with sudden discontinuities in

planner that develops cost-optimized motion plans for hybrid dynamics models.
The hierarchical planner first develops a high-level motion plan to sequence
the local dynamics models to be visited and then converts it into a detailed
continuous state plan. This hierarchical planning approach results in a
decomposition of the POMDP planning problem into smaller sub-parts that can be
solved with significantly lower computational costs. The ability to sequence
the visitation of local dynamics models also provides a powerful way to
leverage the hybrid dynamics to reduce state uncertainty. We evaluate the
proposed planner on a navigation task in the simulated domain and on an
assembly task with a robotic manipulator, showing that our approach can solve
tasks having high observation noise and nonlinear dynamics effectively with
significantly lower computational costs compared to direct planning approaches.

quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation range and one-bit
symbol-level precoding design problem for minimizing the average symbol error
rate (SER) in downlink massive MIMO transmission. A tight upper-bound for SER
with low-resolution DAC precoding is first derived. The derived expression
suggests that the performance degradation of one-bit precoding can be
interpreted as a decrease in the effective minimum distance of the QAM
constellation. Using the obtained SER expression, we propose a QAM
constellation range design for the single-user case. It is shown that in the
massive MIMO limit, a reasonable choice for constellation range with one-bit
precoding is that of the infinite-resolution precoding with per-symbol power
constraint, but reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ or about $0.8$. The
corresponding minimum distance reduction translates to about 2dB gap between
the performance of one-bit precoding and infinite-resolution precoding. This
paper further proposes a low-complexity heuristic algorithm for one-bit
precoder design. Finally, the proposed QAM constellation range and precoder
design are generalized to the multi-user downlink. We propose to scale the
constellation range for infinite-resolution zero-forcing (ZF) precoding with
per-symbol power constraint by the same factor of $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ for one-bit
precoding. The proposed one-bit precoding scheme is shown to be within 2dB of
infinite-resolution ZF. In term of number of antennas, one-bit precoding
requires about 50% more antennas to achieve the same performance as
infinite-resolution precoding.

  2016 arXiv:1607.02046",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose estimation in the wild. A
significant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans
annotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN
architectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of
photorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We
introduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset
of real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D motion capture data.
Given a candidate 3D pose, our algorithm selects for each joint an image whose
2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are then
combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image patches in
a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to train an
end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the training data
into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as a $K$-way
classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large training
sets such as ours. Our method outperforms most of the published works in terms
of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows
promising results for real-world images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs
trained on artificial images generalize well to real images. Compared to data
generated from more classical rendering engines, our synthetic images do not
require any domain adaptation or fine-tuning stage.

radiographic technique for quantitatively reconstructing the density and type
of material present in commercial cargo containers, as a means of detecting
such threats. Unlike traditional techniques which use sources of bremsstrahlung
photons with a continuous distribution of energies, multiple monoenergetic
gamma radiography (MMGR) utilizes monoenergetic photons from nuclear reactions,
specifically the 4.4 and 15.1 MeV photons from the
$^{11}$B(d,n$\gamma$)$^{12}$C reaction. By exploiting the $Z$-dependence of the
photon interaction cross sections at these two specific energies it is possible
to simultaneously determine the areal density and the effective atomic number
as a function of location for a 2D projection of a scanned object. The
additional information gleaned from using and detecting photons of specific
energies for radiography substantially increases the resolving power between
different materials. This paper presents results from the imaging of mock cargo
materials ranging from $Z\approx5$--$92$, demonstrating accurate reconstruction
of the effective atomic number and areal density of the materials over the full
range. In particular, the system is capable of distinguishing pure materials
with $Z\gtrsim70$, such as lead and uranium --- a critical requirement of a
system designed to detect SNM. This methodology could be used to screen
commercial cargoes with high material specificity, to distinguish most benign
materials from SNM, such as uranium and plutonium.

emission, which have been interpreted as the result of an accretion outburst,
possibly due to instabilities in a circumstellar disk. This indicates that this
type of accretion event could be common in young/forming early-type stars and
in their lower mass siblings, and supports the idea that accretion onto the
star may occur in a non-continuous way. Aims. As accretion and ejection are
believed to be tightly associated phenomena, we wanted to confirm the accretion
interpretation of the outburst in S255 NIRS 3 by detecting the corresponding
burst of the associated thermal jet. Methods. We monitored the radio continuum
emission from S255 NIRS 3 at four bands using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array. The millimetre continuum emission was also observed with both the
Northern Extended Millimeter Array of IRAM and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Results. We have detected an exponential
increase in the radio flux density from 6 to 45 GHz starting right after July
10, 2016, namely about 13 months after the estimated onset of the IR outburst.
This is the first ever detection of a radio burst associated with an IR
accretion outburst from a young stellar object. The flux density at all
observed centimetre bands can be reproduced with a simple expanding jet model.
At millimetre wavelengths we infer a marginal flux increase with respect to the
literature values and we show this is due to free-free emission from the radio
jet. Abridged.

down when the scale of the turbulent eddies becomes comparable to the scale of
the variations of the mean magnetic field. Models showing sharp magnetic field

new effects that occur when we relax the restrictions of the standard approach,

the size of the turbulent eddies is comparable to the depth of the convection
zone itself. We approximate the underlying integro-differential equation by a
partial differential equation corresponding to a reaction-diffusion type

  A Case Study Using Heterogeneous Medical Data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic Health Records have become popular sources of data for secondary
research, but their use is hampered by the amount of effort it takes to
overcome the sparsity, irregularity, and noise that they contain. Modern
learning architectures can remove the need for expert-driven feature
engineering, but not the need for expert-driven preprocessing to abstract away
the inherent messiness of clinical data. This preprocessing effort is often the
dominant component of a typical clinical prediction project. In this work we
propose using semantic embedding methods to directly couple the raw, messy
clinical data to downstream learning architectures with truly minimal
preprocessing. We examine this step from the perspective of capturing and
encoding complex data dependencies in the data representation instead of in the
model, which has the nice benefit of allowing downstream processing to be done
with fast, lightweight, and simple models accessible to researchers without
machine learning expertise. We demonstrate with three typical clinical
prediction tasks that the highly compressed, embedded data representations
capture a large amount of useful complexity, although in some cases the
compression is not completely lossless.

the fundamental cluster parameters. Our cluster characterization pipeline first
determined cluster membership with precise astrometry, primarily from TGAS and
HSOY. With initial cluster members established, isochrones were fitted, using a
chi-squared minimization, to the cluster photometry in order to determine
cluster mean distances, ages, and reddening. Cluster membership was also
refined based on the stellar photometry. We used multiband photometry, which
includes ASCC-2.5 BV, 2MASS JHK_s, Gaia G band. We present parameter estimates
for all 24 clusters closer than 333 pc as determined by the Catalogue of Open
Cluster Data and the Milky Way Star Clusters catalog. We find that our
parameters are consistent to those in the Milky Way Star Clusters catalog. We
demonstrate that it is feasible to develop an automated pipeline that

better cluster memberships and more accurate cluster parameters for a much

serious advantage of GPU over CPU, especially for calculations of viscous,
compressible, heat-conductive gas flows with double precision accuracy. In this
paper, two GPU algorithms according to time approximation of convective terms
were presented: explicit and implicit scheme. To decrease data transfers
between device memories and increase the arithmetic intensity of a GPU code we
minimize the number of kernels. The GPU algorithm was implemented in one kernel
for the implicit scheme and two kernels for the explicit scheme. The numerical
equations were put together using macros and optimization, data copy from
global to private memory, and data reuse were left to the compiler. Thus keeps
the code simpler with excellent maintenance. As a test case, we model the flow
past squares in a microchannel at supersonic speed. The tests show that overall
speedup of AMD Radeon R9 280X is up to 102x compared to Intel Core i5-4690 core

(VMs) on-demand in highly dynamic environments, requiring quick placement of
requested VMs into available physical machines (PMs). Due to the randomness of
customer requests, the Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) should be formulated as
an online optimization problem.
  The first part of this work analyzes alternatives to solve the formulated
problem, an experimental comparison of five different online deterministic
heuristics against an offline memetic algorithm with migration of VMs was
performed, considering several experimental workloads. Simulations indicate
that First-Fit Decreasing algorithm (A4) outperforms other evaluated heuristics
on average.
  This work presents a two-phase schema formulation of a VMP problem
considering the optimization of three objective functions in an IaaS
environment with elasticity and overbooking capabilities. The two-phase schema
formulation describes that the allocation of the VMs can be separated into two
sub-problems, the incremental allocation (iVMP) and the reconfiguration of a
placement (VMPr).
  To analyze alternatives to solve the formulated problem, an experimental
comparison of three different objective function scalarization methods as part
of the iVMP and VMPr was performed considering several experimental workloads.
Simulations indicate that the Euclidean distance to origin outperforms other
evaluated scalarization methods on average.
  In order to portray the dynamic nature of an IaaS environment a customizable
workload trace generator was developed to simulate uncertainty in the scenarios
with elasticity and overbooking of resources in VM requests.
  Experimental results proved that the Euclidean distance is preferable over
the other scalarizatiom methods to improve the values of the power consumption
objective function.

Leggett-Garg (LG) and LG-type inequalities, in the $B$ and $K$ meson systems.
We use the tools of open quantum systems to incorporate the effect of
decoherence which is quantified by a single phenomenological parameter. The
effect of $CP$ violation is also included in our analysis. We find that the LG
inequality is violated for both $B$ and $K$ meson systems, the violation being
most prominent in the case of $K$ mesons and least for $B_s$ system. Since the
systems with no coherence do not violate LGI, incorporating
\textit{decoherence} is expected to decrease the extent of violation of LGI and
is clearly brought out in our results. We show that the expression for the LG
functions depends upon an additional term, apart from the experimentally
measurable meson transition probabilities. This term vanishes in the limit of
zero decoherence. On the other hand, the LG-type parameter can be directly
expressed in terms of transition probabilities, making it a more appropriate
observable for studying temporal quantum correlations in neutral meson systems.

fuel from their hosts is an exciting ongoing challenge in extragalactic
astronomy. In this paper we present X-ray observations of eleven extremely red
quasars (ERQs) with $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at $z=1.5-3.2$ with
evidence for high-velocity ($v > 1000$ km s$^{-1}$) [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA\

measure the instantaneous accretion luminosity. We detect ten out of eleven
extremely red quasars available in targeted and archival data. Using a
combination of X-ray spectral fitting and hardness ratios, we find that all of
the ERQs show signs of absorption in the X-rays with inferred column densities
of $N_{\rm H}\approx 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, including four Compton-thick
candidates ($N_{\rm H} > 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). We stack the X-ray emission of
the seven weakly detected sources, measuring an average column density of
$N_{\rm H}\sim 8\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The absorption-corrected (intrinsic)
$2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity of the stack is $2.7\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
consistent with X-ray luminosities of type 1 quasars of the same infrared
luminosity. Thus, we find that ERQs are a highly obscured, borderline
Compton-thick population, and based on optical and infrared data we suggest
that these objects are partially hidden by their own equatorial outflows.
However, unlike some quasars with known outflows, ERQs do not appear to be
intrinsically underluminous in X-rays for their bolometric luminosity. Our
observations indicate that low X-rays are not necessary to enable some types of
radiatively driven winds.

of AGN luminosity functions based on assumed Eddington ratio distribution
functions (ERDFs). We show that the number of AGN hosted by merger galaxies
relative to the total number of AGN increases as a function of AGN luminosity.
This is due to more massive galaxies being more likely to undergo a merger and
does not require the assumption that mergers lead to higher Eddington ratios
than secular processes. Our qualitative analysis also shows that to match the
observations, the probability of a merger galaxy hosting an AGN and accreting
at a given Eddington value has to be increased by a factor ~10 relative to the
general AGN population. An additional significant increase of the fraction of
high Eddington ratio AGN among merger host galaxies leads to inconsistency with
the observed X-ray luminosity function. Physically our results imply that,
compared to the general galaxy population, the AGN fraction among merger
galaxies is ~10 times higher. On average, merger triggering does however not
lead to significantly higher Eddington ratios.

the gas through which Ly$\alpha$ propagates, and these conditions are imprinted
on observables such as the Ly$\alpha$ spectrum and its surface brightness
profile. In this work, we focus on a less-used observable capable of probing
any scattering process: polarization. We implement the density matrix formalism
of polarization into the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code tlac. This allows
us to treat it as a quantum mechanical process where single photons develop and
lose polarization from scatterings in arbitrary gas geometries. We explore
static and expanding ellipsoids, biconical outflows, and clumpy multiphase
media. We find that photons become increasingly polarized as they scatter and
diffuse into the wings of the line profiles, making scattered Ly$\alpha$
polarized in general. The degree and orientation of Ly$\alpha$ polarization
depends on the kinematics and distribution of the scattering HI gas. We find
that it generally probes spatial or velocity space asymmetries and aligns
itself tangentially to the emission source. We show that the mentioned
observables, when studied separately, can leave similar signatures for
different source models. We conclude by revealing how a joint analysis of the

profound effect on its RG properties. Generically for the conformal sector,
complete flows exist only in the reverse direction (i.e. from the infrared to
the ultraviolet). The Gaussian fixed point supports infinite sequences of
composite eigenoperators of increasing infrared relevancy (increasingly
negative mass dimension), which are orthonormal and complete for bare
interactions that are square integrable under the appropriate measure. These
eigenoperators are non-perturbative in $\hbar$ and evanescent. For
$\mathbb{R}^4$ spacetime, each renormalised physical operator exists but only
has support at vanishing field amplitude. In the generic case of infinitely
many non-vanishing couplings, if a complete RG flow exists, it is characterised
in the infrared by a scale $\Lambda_\mathrm{p}>0$, beyond which the field
amplitude is exponentially suppressed. On other spacetimes, of length scale
$L$, the flow ceases to exist once a certain universal measure of inhomogeneity
exceeds $O(1)+2\pi L^2\Lambda^2_\mathrm{p}$. Importantly for cosmology, the
minimum size of the universe is thus tied to the degree of inhomogeneity, with
spacetimes of vanishing size being required to be almost homogeneous. We

(0.4{\deg}, -2.1{\deg}) and (1.0{\deg}, -3.8{\deg}), respectively. Far-infrared
photometric observations complement the Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic data and are
used to construct spectral energy distributions. We find that the dust and PAH
emission are exceptionally similar between C32 and C35 overall, in part
explained due to their locations---they reside on or near boundaries of a 7
Myr-old Galactic outflow event and are partly shock-heated. Within the C32 and
C35 fields, we identify a region of elevated H{\alpha} emission that is
coincident with elevated fine-structure and [O IV] line emission and weak PAH
feature strengths. We are likely tracing a transition zone of the outflow into
the nascent environment. PAH abundances in these fields are slightly depressed
relative to typical ISM values. In the OGLE and NGC 6522 fields, we observe
weak features on a continuum dominated by zodiacal dust. SED fitting indicates
that thermal dust grains in C32 and C35 have comparable temperatures to those
of diffuse, high-latitude cirrus clouds. Little variability is detected in the
PAH properties between C32 and C35, indicating that a stable population of PAHs
dominates the overall spectral appearance. In fact, their PAH features are
exceptionally similar to that of the M82 superwind, emphasizing that we are
probing a local Galactic wind environment.

to study the behavioral dynamics that bots exhibit over the course of one

highlights the presence of short-term behavioral trends in humans, which can be
associated with a cognitive origin, that are absent in bots, intuitively due to
their automated activity. These findings are finally codified to create and
evaluate a machine learning algorithm to detect activity sessions produced by

obtain a one-loop effective action for the gauge fields. In the regime where
charge-independent contributions to higher-derivative terms in the action are
sufficiently small, it is then possible to derive constraints on the
charge-to-mass ratios of the massive particles from requiring that photons
propagate causally and have an analytic S-matrix. We thus find that the
theories need to contain bifundamentals and satisfy a version of the weak

self-consistency of the constraints under Kaluza-Klein compactification, we
furthermore show that, for scalars, they imply a stronger version of the weak

often than liberals and produced 36x more tweets. Additionally, most retweets

regime typically have large radii for their inferred masses, implying the
presence of H$_2$-He atmospheres. These planets are vulnerable to atmospheric
mass loss due to heating by the parent star's XUV flux. Models coupling
atmospheric mass loss with thermal evolution predicted a bimodal distribution
of planetary radii, which has gained observational support. However, a key
component that has been ignored in previous studies is the dissolution of these
gases into the molten core of rock and iron that constitute most of their mass.
Such planets have high temperatures ($>$2000 K) and pressures ($\sim$kbars) at
the core-envelope boundary, ensuring a molten surface and a subsurface
reservoir of hydrogen that can be 5-10 times larger than the atmosphere. This
study bridges this gap by coupling the thermal evolution of the planet and the
mass loss of the atmosphere with the thermodynamic equilibrium between the
dissolved H$_2$ and the atmospheric H$_2$ (Henry's law). Dissolution in the
interior allows a planet to build a larger hydrogen repository during the
planet formation stage. We show that the dissolved hydrogen outgasses to buffer
atmospheric mass loss. The slow cooling of the planet also leads to outgassing
because solubility decreases with decreasing temperature. Dissolution of
hydrogen in the interior therefore increases the atmosphere retention ability
of super-Earths. The study highlights the importance of including the
temperature- and pressure-dependent solubility of gases in magma oceans and
coupling outgassing to planetary evolution models.

are present in the ICM. We argue that the excitation of Alfv\'en waves by CR
streaming, and the replenishment of CR energy via accretion onto the filaments
of high plasma-$\beta$ ICM characterized by low CR pressure support, can
provide the adequate amount of heating to power and sustain the emission from
these filaments. This mechanism does not require the CRs to penetrate the
filaments even if the filaments are magnetically isolated from the ambient ICM
and it may operate irrespectively of whether the filaments are dredged up from
the center or form in situ in the ICM. This picture is qualitatively consistent
with non-thermal line ratios seen in the cold filaments. Future X-ray
observations of the iron line complex with XARM, Lynx, or Athena could help to
test this model by providing constraints on the amount of CRs in the hot plasma
that is cooling and accreting onto the filaments.

It is therefore important to realize quantum gates efficiently, using as few

superconducting circuit for implementing a tunable system consisting of a
qutrit coupled to two qubits. This system can efficiently accomplish various
quantum information tasks, including generation of entanglement of the two
qubits and conditional three-qubit quantum gates, such as the Toffoli and
Fredkin gates. Furthermore, the system realizes a conditional geometric gate

efficiency, robustness and universality of the presented circuit makes it a
promising candidate to serve as a building block for larger networks capable of
performing involved quantum computational tasks.

well as flat two-dimensional surface states related to chiral and mirror

flat-surface states on phonon modes for $\mathrm{SrIrO}_{3}$ side surfaces. We

observed samples of stars are photometrically complete to $\sim$16 mag in the

0.1\% in fractional linear polarization, $p$. The majority of individual
stellar measurements are non-detections. However, our survey strategy enables
us to locate the mean fractional linear polarization $p_{mean}$ in each of the
three regions. The region with lowest dust content yields $p_{mean}=(0.054 \pm
0.038) \%$, not significantly different from zero. We find significant
detections for the remaining two regions of: $p_{mean}=(0.113 \pm 0.036) \%$
and $p_{mean}=(0.208 \pm 0.044) \%$. Using a Bayesian approach we provide upper
limits on the intrinsic spread of the small-scale distributions of $q$ and $u$.
At the detected $p_{mean}$ levels, the determination of the systematic
uncertainty is critical for the reliability of the measurements. We verify the
significance of our detections with statistical tests, accounting for all

value of the scalar curvature of the induced metric. In this paper, I examine
solutions that contain both shG-type and chG-type regions. The boundary between
these regions moves with the speed of light. I show that near such boundaries
(generalized) solitons can be classically pair-produced. The solitons move
subluminally (superluminally) in the shG (chG) region on the worldsheet, and
they correspond to cusps on the string. A direct energy cascade is observed at
the moment of pair-creation.
  For the calculations, I use an exact discretization of the equation of
motion. The solutions are segmented strings. In this discrete system,
pair-production leads to a complete evaporation of the shG region. The final
state is a gas of cusps in a chG environment. A Mathematica notebook that has

information exchange over a backhaul connecting the cooperating base stations

motivate the study of cooperative approaches based only on local channel state

reciprocity and iterative spatially precoded over-the-air pilot signaling. We

allowing BSs and user equipments (UEs) to iteratively optimize their respective
transmitters/receivers based on only locally measured CSI. The trade-off due to
the overhead from the F-B iterations is discussed. We also consider the
challenge of dynamic TDD where the UE-UE channel knowledge cannot be acquired
at the BSs by exploiting channel reciprocity. Finally, standardization

and future colliders. It directly probes the Higgs potential and its
fundamental properties in connection to new physics beyond the Standard Model.
There exist two phase space regions with an enhanced sensitivity to the Higgs
self-coupling, the Higgs pair production threshold and an intermediate top pair
threshold. We show how the invariant mass distribution of the Higgs pair offers
a systematic way to extract the Higgs self-coupling, focusing on the leading
channel $pp\to hh+X\to b\bar b\ \gamma\gamma+X$. We utilize new features of the
signal events at higher energies and estimate the potential of a high-energy
upgrade of the LHC and a future hadron collider with realistic simulations. We
find that the high-energy upgrade of the LHC to 27 TeV would reach a 5$\sigma$
observation with an integrated luminosity of 2.5 ab$^{-1}$. It would have the
potential to reach 15% (30%) accuracy at the 68% (95%) confidence level to
determine the SM Higgs boson self-coupling. A future 100 TeV collider could
improve the self-coupling measurement to better than 5% (10%) at the 68% (95%)
confidence level.

P-value from a new perspective which leads to a remarkably simple and powerful
method. Statistical methods, such as the Rank Truncated Product (RTP), have
been developed for combining top-ranking associations and this general strategy
proved to be useful in applications for detecting combined effects of multiple
disease components. To increase power, these methods aggregate signals across
top ranking SNPs, while adjusting for their total number assessed in a study.
Analytic expressions for combined top statistics or P-values tend to be
unwieldy, which complicates interpretation, practical implementation, and
hinders further developments. Here, we propose the Augmented Rank Truncation
(ART) method that retains main characteristics of the RTP but is substantially
simpler to implement. ART leads to an efficient form of the adaptive algorithm,
an approach where the number of top ranking SNPs is varied to optimize power.
We illustrate our methods by strengthening previously reported associations of
$\mu$-opioid receptor variants with sensitivity to pain.

magnetized white dwarf (WD) that interacts with its red-dwarf companion to
produce a large-amplitude, highly coherent pulsation every 1.97 minutes. Over
the course of two years, we obtained thirty-nine hours of time-resolved,
optical photometry of AR Sco at a typical cadence of 5 seconds to study this
pulsation. We find that it undergoes significant changes across the binary
orbital period and that its amplitude, phase, and waveform all vary as a
function of orbital phase. We show that these variations can be explained by
constructive and destructive interference between two periodic, double-peaked
signals: the spin-orbit beat pulse, and a weaker WD spin pulse. Modelling of
the light curve indicates that in the optical, the amplitude of the primary
spin pulse is 50% of the primary beat amplitude, while the secondary maxima of
the beat and spin pulses have similar amplitudes. Finally, we use our timings
of the beat pulses to confirm the presence of the disputed spin-down of the WD.
We measure a beat-frequency derivative of -5.14(32) x 10^-17 Hz/s and show that
this is attributable to the spin-down of the WD. This value is approximately
twice as large as the estimate from Marsh et al. (2016) but is nevertheless
consistent with the constraints established in Potter & Buckley (2018). Our
precise measurement of the spin-down rate confirms that the decaying rotational
energy of the magnetized white dwarf is sufficient to power the excess
electromagnetic radiation emitted by the binary.

freezing, which proceeds by the rapid eradication of lattice defects as the

on closed surfaces are required by topology to have a minimum number of lattice
defects, called disclinations, that act as conserved topological charges;
consider the 12 pentagons on a soccer ball or the 12 pentamers in a viral
capsid. Moreover, crystals assembled on curved surfaces can spontaneously
develop additional defects to alleviate the stress imposed by the curvature.
How then can we have crystallization on a sphere, the simplest curved surface
where it is impossible to eliminate these defects? Here we show that freezing
on a sphere proceeds by the formation of a single, encompassing ""continent,""
which forces defects into 12 isolated ""seas"" with the same icosahedral symmetry
as soccer balls and viruses. We use this broken symmetry - aligning the
vertices of an icosahedron with the defect seas and unfolding the faces onto a
plane - to construct a new order parameter that reveals the underlying
long-range orientational order of the lattice. These results further our

  substantially improved throughout",,,,"math.CO math.AT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given any polytope $P$ and any generic linear functional ${\bf c} $, one
obtains a directed graph $G(P,{\bf c})$ by taking the 1-skeleton of $P$ and
orienting each edge $e(u,v)$ from $u$ to $v$ for ${\bf c} (u) < {\bf c} ( v)$.
This paper raises the question of finding sufficient conditions on a polytope
$P$ and generic cost vector ${\bf c}$ so that the graph $G(P, {\bf c} )$ will
not have any directed paths which revisit any face of $P$ after departing from
that face. This is in a sense equivalent to the question of finding conditions
on $P$ and ${\bf c} $ under which the simplex method for linear programming
will be efficient under all choices of pivot rules. Conditions on $P$ and ${\bf
c}$ are given which provably yield a corollary of the desired face
nonrevisiting property and which are conjectured to give the desired property
itself. This conjecture is proven for 3-polytopes and for spindles having the
two distinguished vertices as source and sink; this shows that known
counterexamples to the Hirsch Conjecture will not provide counterexamples to
this conjecture.
  A part of the proposed set of conditions is that $G(P, {\bf c} )$ be the
Hasse diagram of a partially ordered set, which is equivalent to requiring non
revisiting of 1-dimensional faces. This opens the door to the usage of
poset-theoretic techniques. This work also leads to a result for simple
polytopes in which $G(P, {\bf c})$ is the Hasse diagram of a lattice L that the
order complex of each open interval in L is homotopy equivalent to a ball or a
sphere of some dimension. Applications are given to the weak Bruhat order, the
Tamari lattice, and more generally to the Cambrian lattices, using realizations
of the Hasse diagrams of these posets as 1-skeleta of permutahedra,
associahedra, and generalized associahedra.

the 5G~system. Many of the currently talked about solutions to positioning
in~5G are centralized, mostly requiring direct line-of-sight (LoS) to deployed
access nodes or anchors at the same time, which in turn requires high-density
deployments of anchors. But these LoS and centralized positioning solutions may
become unwieldy as the number of users and devices continues to grow without
limit in sight. As an alternative to the centralized solutions, this paper
discusses distributed localization in a 5G enabled IoT environment where many
low power devices, users, or agents are to locate themselves without global or
LoS access to anchors. Even though positioning is essentially a non-linear
problem (solving circle equations by trilateration or triangulation), we
discuss a cooperative \textit{linear} distributed iterative solution with only
local measurements, communication and computation needed at each agent.
Linearity is obtained by reparametrization of the agent location through
barycentric coordinate representations based on local neighborhood geometry
that may be computed in terms of certain Cayley-Menger determinants involving
relative local inter-agent distance measurements.

structural brain connectivity in normal development and in a broad range of
brain disorders. However efforts to derive inherent characteristics of
structural brain networks have been hampered by the very high dimensionality of
the data, relatively small sample sizes, and the lack of widely acceptable
connectivity-based regions of interests (ROIs). Typical approaches have focused
either on regions defined by standard anatomical atlases that do not
incorporate anatomical connectivity, or have been based on voxel-wise analysis,
which results in loss of statistical power relative to structure-wise
connectivity analysis. In this work, we propose a novel, computationally
efficient iterative clustering method to generate connectivity-based
whole-brain parcellations that converge to a stable parcellation in a few
iterations. Our algorithm is based on a sparse representation of the whole
brain connectivity matrix, which reduces the number of edges from around a half
billion to a few million while incorporating the necessary spatial constraints.
We show that the resulting regions in a sense capture the inherent connectivity
information present in the data, and are stable with respect to initialization
and the randomization scheme within the algorithm. These parcellations provide
consistent structural regions across the subjects of population samples that
are homogeneous with respect to anatomic connectivity. Our method also derives
connectivity structures that can be used to distinguish between population
samples with known different structural connectivity. In particular, new
results in structural differences for different population samples such as
Females vs Males, Normal Controls vs Schizophrenia, and different age groups in
Normal Controls are also shown.

of heat, mass, and momentum on multiple scales. For real-world applications of
wall-bounded turbulence, the underlying surfaces are virtually always rough;
yet characterizing and understanding the effects of wall roughness for
turbulence remains a challenge, especially for rotating and thermally driven
turbulence. By combining extensive experiments and numerical simulations, here,
taking as example the paradigmatic Taylor-Couette system (the closed flow
between two independently rotating coaxial cylinders), we show how wall
roughness greatly enhances the overall transport properties and the
corresponding scaling exponents. If only one of the walls is rough, we reveal
that the bulk velocity is slaved to the rough side, due to the much stronger
coupling to that wall by the detaching flow structures. If both walls are
rough, the viscosity dependence is thoroughly eliminated in the boundary layers
and we thus achieve asymptotic ultimate turbulence, i.e. the upper limit of
transport, whose existence had been predicted by Robert Kraichnan in 1962
(Phys. Fluids {\bf 5}, 1374 (1962)) and in which the scalings laws can be

is consequently a benchmark for studying star formation feedback at both low
and high redshift. We present new VLA HI observations that reveal the cold gas
kinematics along the minor axis in unprecedented detail. This includes the
detection of HI up to 10 kpc along the minor axis toward the South and beyond 5
kpc to the North. A surprising aspect of these observations is that the
line-of-sight HI velocity decreases substantially from about 120 km/s to 50
km/s from 1.5 to 10 kpc off the midplane. The velocity profile is not
consistent with the HI gas cooling from the hot wind. We demonstrate that the
velocity decrease is substantially greater than the deceleration expected from
gravitational forces alone. If the HI consists of a continuous population of
cold clouds, some additional drag force must be present, and the magnitude of
the drag force places a joint constraint on the ratio of the ambient medium to
the typical cloud size and density. We also show that the HI kinematics are
inconsistent with a simple conical outflow centered on the nucleus, but instead
require the more widespread launch of the HI over the ~1 kpc extent of the
starburst region. Regardless of the launch mechanism for the HI gas, the
observed velocity decrease along the minor axis is sufficiently great that the
HI may not escape the halo of M82. We estimate the HI outflow rate is much less

that a massive (10MSun) star was nearby when it exploded in a supernova. The
repercussions of a supernova can be rather profound, and the current Solar
System may still bear the memory of this traumatic event. The truncation of the
Kuiper belt and the tilt of the ecliptic plane with respect to the Sun's
rotation axis could be such signatures. We simulated the effect of a nearby
supernova on the young Solar System using the Astronomical Multipurpose
Software Environment. Our calculations are realized in two subsequent steps in
which we study the effect of the supernova irradiation on the circumstellar
disk and the effect of the impact of the nuclear blast-wave which arrives a few
decades later. We find that the blastwave of our adopted supernova exploding at
a distance of $0.15$--$0.40$\,pc and at an angle of $35^\circ$--$65^\circ$ with
respect to the angular-momentum axis of the circumsolar disk would induce a
misalignment between the Sun's equator and its disk to $5^\circ.6\pm1^\circ.2$,
consistent with the current value. The blast of a supernova truncates the disk
at a radius between $42$ and $55$\,au, which is consistent with the current
edge of the Kuiper belt. For the most favored parameters, the irradiation by
the supernova as well as the blast wave heat the majority of the disk to $\sim
1200$\,K, which is sufficiently hot to melt chondrules in the circumstellar
disk. The majority of planetary system may have been affected by a nearby
supernova, some of its repercussions, such as truncation and tilting of the
disk, may still be visible in their current planetary system's topology. The
amount of material from the supernova blast wave that is accreted by the

decrease with age due to the growth from micron-sized particles to
planetesimals and planets. Mature circumstellar disks, however, can be observed
to contain significant amounts of dust and possess high dust-to-gas ratios.
Using HD 163296 as our case study, we explore how the formation of giant
planets in disks can create the conditions for collisionally rejuvenating the
dust population, halting or reversing the expected trend. We combine N-body
simulations with statistical methods and impact scaling laws to estimate the
dynamical and collisional excitation of the planetesimals due to the formation
of HD 163296's giant planets. We show that this process creates a violent
collisional environment across the disk that can inject collisionally produced
second-generation dust into it, significantly contributing to the observed
dust-to-gas ratio. The spatial distribution of the dust production can explain
the observed local enrichments in HD 163296's inner regions. The results
obtained for HD 163296 can be extended to any disk with embedded forming giant
planets and may indicate a common evolutionary stage in the life of such
circumstellar disks. Furthermore, the dynamical excitation of the planetesimals
could result in the release of transient, non-equilibrium gas species like H2O,
CO2, NH3 and CO in the disk due to ice sublimation during impacts and, due to
the excited planetesimals being supersonic with respect to the gas, could
produce bow shocks in the latter that could heat it and cause a broadening of
its emission lines.

  convection, second-order scheme, advection of a step profile, Smith and
  Hutton problem",,,,"math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent decades are put lots of efforts to develop a higher-order scheme for
convective terms approximation that is stable and reliable. The idea presented
here is that approximation approach has to correspond to the physical
phenomenon described by approximated terms. Pure convection (advection) that is
described by convective terms is transporting a property along the streamline,
and the information propagation is unidirectional, i.e., transported property
depends on previous values along the streamline but does not depend on the next
ones. The proposed approach represents streamlines on mesh as discrete
streamlines and is called Discrete Stream(line) Method (DStreaM). A discrete
streamline here is represented as a narrow triangle with one vertex of the
approximated node and two others neighbor upstream nodes. Discrete streamlines
are orientated using local flow direction as skew upwind schemes. DStreaM
corresponds to pure convection. Here are considered standard test problems:
advection of a step profile, advection of a double-step profile, advection of a
sinusoidal profile, and Smith and Hutton problem. DStreaM solutions were
compared with upwind-first order scheme and second-order Total Variation
Diminishing (TVD) schemes with limiters Min-Mod, QUICK, and SUPERBEE solutions.
DStreaM demonstrated second-order accuracy and rapid convergence. Upwind and
DStreaM need 2 or 4 iterations to reach a final solution while TVD schemes need
from 15 to 93.5 more iterations. DStreaM approach looks promising for
calculation of convective-dominated problems because it approximates naturally
first derivatives and is straightforwardly applicable as a meshfree method or
on unstructured meshes.

linear SMILES strings instead of graphs. Our junction tree variational
autoencoder generates molecular graphs in two phases, by first generating a
tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures, and then combining them
into a molecule with a graph message passing network. This approach allows us
to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical validity at every

both real and fake samples, the generator only has control over the fake
samples it produces since the real data distribution is fixed by the choice of
a given dataset. We propose a simple modification that gives the generator
control over the real samples which leads to a tempered learning process for
both generator and discriminator. The real data distribution passes through a
lens before being revealed to the discriminator, balancing the generator and
discriminator by gradually revealing more detailed features necessary to
produce high-quality results. The proposed module automatically adjusts the
learning process to the current strength of the networks, yet is generic and
easy to add to any GAN variant. In a number of experiments, we show that this

scenarios are considered (a) evolution according to unitary circuits and (b)
evolution due to Hamiltonians that we can control in a time-dependent fashion.
We find that the time needed to realize a certain measurement to a predefined
accuracy scales in general exponentially with the system size -- posing a
fundamental limitation. The argument is based, on the construction of
$\varepsilon$-packings for manifolds of observables with identical spectra and
a comparison of their cardinalities to those of $\varepsilon$-coverings for
quantum circuits and unitary time-evolution operators. The former is related to
the study of Grassmann manifolds.

generates motion in a deterministic way. Nevertheless, from the time series

because such 9-DoF (degrees of freedom) systems are capable of achieving
drift-free 3D orientation tracking. However, these systems are often vulnerable
to ambient magnetic distortions and lack useful position information; in the
absence of external position aiding (e.g. satellite/ultra-wideband positioning
systems) the dead-reckoned position accuracy from a 9-DoF MEMS IMU deteriorates
rapidly due to unmodelled errors. Positioning information is valuable in many
satellite-denied geomatics applications (e.g. indoor navigation, location-based
services, etc.). This paper proposes an improved 9-DoF IMU indoor pose tracking
method using batch optimization. By adopting a robust in-situ user
self-calibration approach to model the systematic errors of the accelerometer,
gyroscope, and magnetometer simultaneously in a tightly-coupled post-processed
least-squares framework, the accuracy of the estimated trajectory from a 9-DoF
MEMS IMU can be improved. Through a combination of relative magnetic
measurement updates and a robust weight function, the method is able to
tolerate a high level of magnetic distortions. The proposed auto-calibration
method was tested in-use under various heterogeneous magnetic field conditions
to mimic a person walking with the sensor in their pocket, a person checking
their phone, and a person walking with a smartwatch. In these experiments, the
presented algorithm improved the in-situ dead-reckoning orientation accuracy by
79.8 - 89.5% and the dead-reckoned positioning accuracy by 72.9 - 92.8%, thus
reducing the relative positioning error from metre-level to decimetre-level
after ten seconds of integration, without making assumptions about the user's

strikes also under currently unpredicted conditions. Here we show, using
theory, simulations and experiments, another mechanism for liquefaction in
saturated soils, without necessitating high pore fluid pressure or special
soils, whereby seismically triggered liquefaction is controlled by buoyancy
forces. This new mechanism supplements the conventional pore pressure
mechanism, enlarges the window of conditions under which liquefaction is
predicted to occur, and may explain previously not understood cases such as
liquefaction in well-compacted soils, under drained conditions, repeated
liquefaction cases, and the basics of sinking in quicksand. These results may
greatly impact hazard assessment and mitigation in seismically active areas.

completion (KBC). It can be formulated as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem
with a known state transition model. To overcome the challenge of sparse
rewards, we develop a graph-walking agent called M-Walk, which consists of a
deep recurrent neural network (RNN) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The RNN
encodes the state (i.e., history of the walked path) and maps it separately to
a policy and Q-values. In order to effectively train the agent from sparse
rewards, we combine MCTS with the neural policy to generate trajectories
yielding more positive rewards. From these trajectories, the network is
improved in an off-policy manner using Q-learning, which modifies the RNN
policy via parameter sharing. Our proposed RL algorithm repeatedly applies this
policy-improvement step to learn the model. At test time, MCTS is combined with
the neural policy to predict the target node. Experimental results on several
graph-walking benchmarks show that M-Walk is able to learn better policies than
other RL-based methods, which are mainly based on policy gradients. M-Walk also
outperforms traditional KBC baselines.

clustering, generalizing the notion of a Bayes optimal partition from classical

released here https://github.com/qianguih/RSNet}, to efficiently model local
structures in point clouds. The key component of the RSNet is a lightweight
local dependency module. It is a combination of a novel slice pooling layer,
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers, and a slice unpooling layer. The slice
pooling layer is designed to project features of unordered points onto an
ordered sequence of feature vectors so that traditional end-to-end learning
algorithms (RNNs) can be applied. The performance of RSNet is validated by
comprehensive experiments on the S3DIS\cite{stanford}, ScanNet\cite{scannet},

previous state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks. And comparisons against
previous state-of-the-art methods \cite{pointnet, pointnet2} demonstrate the

semantic representation and encoding information that can be used to measure
data similarity, by relying on the embedding learned from metric learning. At
the same time, variational autoencoder (VAE) has widely been used to
approximate inference and proved to have a good performance for directed
probabilistic models. However, for traditional VAE, the data label or feature
information are intractable. Similarly, traditional representation learning
approaches fail to represent many salient aspects of the data. In this project,
we propose a novel integrated framework to learn latent embedding in VAE by
incorporating deep metric learning. The features are learned by optimizing a
triplet loss on the mean vectors of VAE in conjunction with standard evidence
lower bound (ELBO) of VAE. This approach, which we call Triplet based
Variational Autoencoder (TVAE), allows us to capture more fine-grained
information in the latent embedding. Our model is tested on MNIST data set and
achieves a high triplet accuracy of 95.60% while the traditional VAE (Kingma &
Welling, 2013) achieves triplet accuracy of 75.08%.

inferior embedding in real-world graph data. In this paper, we propose a novel
adversarial graph embedding framework for graph data. The framework encodes the
topological structure and node content in a graph to a compact representation,
on which a decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore,
the latent representation is enforced to match a prior distribution via an
adversarial training scheme. To learn a robust embedding, two variants of
adversarial approaches, adversarially regularized graph autoencoder (ARGA) and
adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder (ARVGA), are developed.
Experimental studies on real-world graphs validate our design and demonstrate

promising hypotheses is that these modes are driven by Jovian storms. This work
constructs a framework to analytically model the expected equilibrium normal
mode amplitudes arising from convective columns in storms. We also place rough
constraints on Jupiter's seismic modal quality factor. Using this model,
neither meteor strikes, turbulent convection, nor water storms can feasibly
excite the order of magnitude of observed amplitudes. Next we speculate about
the potential role of rock storms deeper in Jupiter's atmosphere, because the
rock storms' expected energy scales make them promising candidates to be the
chief source of excitation for Jovian seismic modes, based on simple scaling
arguments. We also suggest some general trends in the expected partition of

pc of the nuclear position, consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission
from nuclear star formation or from an outflow powered by an active galactic
nucleus (AGN). A linear spur of radio emission juts out of the nuclear source
towards the kpc-scale arcs (detected in radio, Halpha and X-ray bands). From
the size, shock velocity, and Balmer line luminosity of the kpc-scale bubble,

become an intense focus of condensed matter physics, where it arises in the
context of the quantum Hall effect [1] and topological insulators [2]. In each
case, topology is defined through invariants of the material's bulk [3-5], but
experimentally measured through chiral/helical properties of the material's
edges. In this work we measure topological invariants of a quantum Hall
material through local response of the bulk: treating the material as a
many-port circulator enables direct measurement of the Chern number as the
spatial winding of the circulator phase; excess density accumulation near
spatial curvature quantifies the curvature-analog of charge known as mean
orbital spin, while the moment of inertia of this excess density reflects the
chiral central charge. We observe that the topological invariants converge to
their global values when probed over a few magnetic lengths lB, consistent with
intuition that the bulk/edge distinction exists only for samples larger than a
few lB. By performing these experiments in photonic Landau levels of a twisted

interventions. Concretely, we present the results of an open benchmark we have
developed that lets us compare a number of different algorithms under a variety
of fairness measures, and a large number of existing datasets. We find that
although different algorithms tend to prefer specific formulations of fairness
preservations, many of these measures strongly correlate with one another. In
addition, we find that fairness-preserving algorithms tend to be sensitive to
fluctuations in dataset composition (simulated in our benchmark by varying
training-test splits), indicating that fairness interventions might be more
brittle than previously thought.

with intraclass variations such as illumination, rotation, viewpoint and small
scale changes. In contrast, in real-world applications a change in scale can
have a dramatic impact on texture appearance, to the point of changing
completely from one texture category to another. As a result, texture
variations due to changes in scale are amongst the hardest to handle. In this
work we conduct the first study of classifying textures with extreme variations
in scale. To address this issue, we first propose and then reduce scale
proposals on the basis of dominant texture patterns. Motivated by the
challenges posed by this problem, we propose a new GANet network where we use a
Genetic Algorithm to change the units in the hidden layers during network
training, in order to promote the learning of more informative semantic texture
patterns. Finally, we adopt a FVCNN (Fisher Vector pooling of a Convolutional
Neural Network filter bank) feature encoder for global texture representation.
  Because extreme scale variations are not necessarily present in most standard
texture databases, to support the proposed extreme-scale aspects of texture
understanding we are developing a new dataset, the Extreme Scale Variation
Textures (ESVaT), to test the performance of our framework. It is demonstrated
that the proposed framework significantly outperforms gold-standard texture
features by more than 10% on ESVaT. We also test the performance of our
proposed approach on the KTHTIPS2b and OS datasets and a further dataset
synthetically derived from Forrest, showing superior performance compared to
the state of the art.

including the pure characteristics model in Berry and Pakes(2007) and the
random coefficient logit model in Berry et al.(1995) (hereafter BLP). The
method transforms the original market share inversion problem to an
unconstrained convex minimization problem, so that any convex programming
algorithm can be used to solve the inversion. Moreover, such results also imply
that the computational complexity of inverting a demand model should be no more

the proposed spectral distance naturally captures the structural differences in

involve directly sampling the latent variables along with the model parameters.
In high-level software code for model definitions (using, e.g., BUGS, JAGS,
Stan), the likelihood is therefore specified as conditional on the latent
variables. This can lead researchers to perform model comparisons via
conditional likelihoods, where the latent variables are considered model
parameters. In other settings, however, typical model comparisons involve
marginal likelihoods where the latent variables are integrated out. This
distinction is often overlooked despite the fact that it can have a large
impact on the comparisons of interest. In this paper, we clarify and illustrate
these issues, focusing on the comparison of conditional and marginal Deviance
Information Criteria (DICs) and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAICs) in
psychometric modeling. The conditional/marginal distinction corresponds to
whether the model should be predictive for the clusters that are in the data or
for new clusters (where ""clusters"" typically correspond to higher-level units
like people or schools). Correspondingly, we show that marginal WAIC
corresponds to leave-one-cluster out (LOcO) cross-validation, whereas
conditional WAIC corresponds to leave-one-unit out (LOuO). These results lead
to recommendations on the general application of the criteria to models with
latent variables.

power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of
oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper edge at fixed $\nu_{\rm

range magnetically ordered state is observed, while for higher x than 0.4 %
magnetic order becomes more disordered and is completely suppressed for x = 1.5
%. The magnetic volume fraction continuously decreases with increasing x. The
combination of magnetic and superconducting volumes implies that a
spatially-overlapping coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity spans a
large region of the T-x phase diagram for NaFe_1-xNi_xAs . A strong reduction
of both the ordered moment size and the volume fraction is observed below the
superconducting T_C for x = 0.6, 1.0, and 1.3 %, in contrast to other iron
pnictides in which one of these two parameters exhibits a reduction below TC,
but not both. The suppression of magnetic order is further enhanced with
increased Ni doping, leading to a reentrant non-magnetic state below T_C for x
= 1.3 %. The reentrant behavior indicates an interplay between
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity involving competition for the same
electrons. These observations are consistent with the sign-changing s-wave
superconducting state, which is expected to appear on the verge of microscopic
coexistence and phase separation with magnetism. We also present a universal
linear relationship between the local ordered moment size and the
antiferromagnetic ordering temperature TN across a variety of iron-based

galaxy clustering measurements depending on the cosmological parameters and
galaxy bias. To this end, we have produced 9000 galaxy mock catalogues relying
on the effective Zel'dovich approximation implemented in the EZmocks computer
code, using different input cosmological models and bias parameters. The
reference catalogue has also been produced with this code making our study
insensitive to the approximation at least on a relative-qualitative level. Our
findings indicate that the covariance matrix is insensitive to the input power
spectrum (including $\sigma_8$), as long as the 2- and 3-point galaxy
clustering measurements agree with the given data. In fact, the covariance
matrix shows a bias at small scales ($r\lesssim40 h^{-1}$Mpc) when the chosen
galaxy bias parameters yield a 3-point statistics, which is not compatible with
the reference one within the error bars, even though the 2-point statistics
agree within 1%. Nevertheless, the error becomes negligible at large scales
making the covariance matrix still reliable for data analysis using only
measurements in that regime (e.g., measuring baryon acoustic oscillations).
  High precision in cosmological parameter estimation is expected for
covariance matrices extracted from mock galaxy catalogues which take accurately
into account both the 2- and the 3- point statistics. This is independent of
whether this is achieved by using the right cosmology and galaxy bias (which
are not a priori known) or just any combination of both fitting the net
observed galaxy clustering.

next-nearest hopping when the bottom of the conduction band and top of the
valence band does not simultaneously coincide at Dirac point. We consider
normal-ferromagnetic-normal (N-F-N) junction of the materials and using the
generalized scattering approach calculate the spin current. Here, we show that
tilting the Dirac cones can strongly change the transport properties by
modifying the period of oscillation of the spin current. The spin conductance
can be effectively tuned by the tilt with taking advantage of the modified
interference condition. A pure spin current reversal also possible with a
smooth variation of the tilting. We further study the spin current by the
adiabatic precession of a doped ferromagnet on top of the material. It is shown
that the spin-mixing conductance and hence the spin current can become zero by
turning the tilt of the Dirac cone. Our findings provide an efficient way
towards high controllability of spin transport by tuning the tilt of the

enhancement of NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) signals, which utilizes
parahydrogen (pH2, the H2 molecule in its nuclear spin state) as a source of
non-thermal spin order. In SABRE experiments, pH2 binds to an organometallic
complex with a to-be-polarized substrate; subsequently, spin order transfer
takes place and the substrate acquires non-thermal spin polarization resulting
in strong NMR signal enhancement. In this work we argue that the spin order of
H2 in SABRE experiments performed at high magnetic fields is not necessarily
the singlet order but rather anti-phase polarization, $S_{1z}S_{2z}$. Although
SABRE exploits pH2, i.e., the starting spin order of H2 is supposed to be the
singlet order, in solution S-T0 conversion becomes efficient once pH2 binds to
a complex. Such a variation of the spin order, which becomes $S_{1z}S_{2z}$,
has an important consequence: NMR methods used for transferring SABRE
polarization need to be modified. Here we demonstrate that methods proposed for
the initial singlet order may not work for the S_1z S_2z order; however, a
simple modification makes them efficient again. A theoretical treatment of the
problem under consideration is proposed; these considerations are supported by
high-field SABRE experiments. Hence, for efficient use of SABRE one should note
that polarization formation is a complex multi-stage process: careful
optimization of this process may not only deal with chemical aspects but also
with the spin dynamics, including the spin dynamics of H2.

learning of a certain class of non-smooth functions, which was not covered by

with a ReLU activation, and show that convergence rates of the generalization
by DNNs are almost optimal to estimate the non-smooth functions, while some of

finite-sum problems. In particular, the objective function is given by the
summation of a differentiable (possibly nonconvex) component, together with a
possibly non-differentiable but convex component. We propose a proximal
stochastic gradient algorithm based on variance reduction, called ProxSVRG+.
Our main contribution lies in the analysis of ProxSVRG+. It recovers several
existing convergence results and improves/generalizes them (in terms of the
number of stochastic gradient oracle calls and proximal oracle calls). In
particular, ProxSVRG+ generalizes the best results given by the SCSG algorithm,
recently proposed by [Lei et al., 2017] for the smooth nonconvex case.
ProxSVRG+ is also more straightforward than SCSG and yields simpler analysis.
Moreover, ProxSVRG+ outperforms the deterministic proximal gradient descent
(ProxGD) for a wide range of minibatch sizes, which partially solves an open
problem proposed in [Reddi et al., 2016b]. Also, ProxSVRG+ uses much less
proximal oracle calls than ProxSVRG [Reddi et al., 2016b]. Moreover, for
nonconvex functions satisfied Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz condition, we prove that
ProxSVRG+ achieves a global linear convergence rate without restart unlike
ProxSVRG. Thus, it can \emph{automatically} switch to the faster linear
convergence in some regions as long as the objective function satisfies the PL
condition locally in these regions. ProxSVRG+ also improves ProxGD and
ProxSVRG/SAGA, and generalizes the results of SCSG in this case. Finally, we
conduct several experiments and the experimental results are consistent with

estimate the intrinsic velocity dispersion profile using the observed
second-moment of the HI data. We apply our {\it iterative} method to a recently
discovered dwarf galaxy Leo T and find that its observed HI distribution does
not comply with the expected one if one assumes no dark matter in it. To model
the mass distribution in Leo T, we solve the Poisson's equation using a large
number of trial dark matter halos and compare the model HI surface density
($\Sigma_{HI}$) profiles to the observed one to identify the best dark matter
halo parameters. For Leo T, we find a pseudo-isothermal halo with core density,
$\rho_0 \sim 0.67$ $\rm M_{\odot} \thinspace pc^{-3}$ and core radius, $r_s
\sim 37$ parsec explains the observation best. The resulting dark matter halo
mass within the central 300 pc, $M_{300}$, found to be $\sim 2.7 \times 10^6$
$\rm M_{\odot}$. We also find that a set of dark matter halos with similar
$M_{300} \sim 3.7 \times 10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ but very different $\rho_0$ and
$r_s$ values, can produce equally good $\Sigma_{HI}$ profile within the
observational uncertainties. This, in turn, indicates a strong degeneracy
between the halo parameters and the best fit values are not unique.
Interestingly, it also implies that the mass of a dark matter halo, rather than
its structure primarily directs the expected HI distribution under hydrostatic
equilibrium.

information, which is manifested quantitatively in the decay of the

scrambling affected when the system is coupled to the environment and suffers
from dissipation? In this paper, we address this question by defining a
dissipative version of OTOC and numerically study its behavior in a
prototypical chaotic quantum chain in the presence of dissipation. We find that
dissipation leads to not only the overall decay of the scrambled information
due to leaking, but also structural changes so that the `information light

removed. Based on this observation we conjecture a modified version of the

with almost 180{\deg} phase angle is confirmed by using the vertical and
lateral Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM). In addition, it elucidates that
obvious polarization rotation behavior can be observed in the sample with
increasing Cu concentration. Furthermore, correlation of the RS behavior with
PO behavior has been studied by performing various mode SPM measurements on the
same location. The electric field resulted from the opposite polarization
orientation are corresponded to the different resistance states. It is found
that the region with the polarization in downward direction has low resistance
state (LRS), whereas the region with upward polarization has high resistance
state (HRS). In addition, the Piezoresponse Force Spectroscopy (PFS) and
Switching Spectroscopy PFM (SS-PFM) measurements further confirm that the
existence of the built-in field due to the uncomplemented polarization may
affect the depletion region and hence contribute to the RS behavior. In
addition, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) results show that, when
ZnO-based thin films is subjected to negative and then followed by positive

get an insight into the mechanism in which the support affects the activity of
vanadia in the oxidation processes. The energy of the V=O group dissociation
chosen as a descriptor of the oxidation activity is estimated using two aligned
divanadate V2O3(OH)4 particles at various distances. Separation between
particles allows to imitate (i) the various supporting materials (e.g. TiO2,
SiO2, etc.), and (ii) the coverage of vanadia on a particular support. A
substantial compensation of the energy loss upon the vanadyl oxygen abstraction
via bonding to the vanadyl oxygen of neighboring vanadate particle has been
predicted. On account of such compensation the overall energy of the V=O
dissociation reaches its minimal value of 36 kcal/mol (dropping from maximum of
142 kcal/mol) at small separation of 3 {\AA} between dimers when the nearest
vanadyl oxygen occupies a bridge V-O-V position. For dimers separated by about
4 {\AA}, the dissociation energy achieves its maximal value for isolated dimers
of about 143 kcal/mol. Thus, these findings allows one to conclude that the
oxygen mobility is a result of a compensation effect in a chain-like bonding
between neighboring vanadyl groups on the surface of support.

encodes a data sample into a latent code vector. Unlike previous hybrid
approaches that leverage adversarial training criterion in constructing
autoencoders, FAAE minimizes re-encoding errors in the latent space and
exploits adversarial criterion in the data space. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework produces sharper reconstructed images

transmitters in a visible light positioning (VLP) system is considered for the
purpose of improving localization performance of visible light communication
(VLC) receivers. Specifically, the aim is to minimize the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower
bound (CRLB) on the localization error of a VLC receiver by optimizing LED
transmission powers in the presence of practical constraints such as individual
and total power limitations and illuminance constraints. The formulated
optimization problem is shown to be convex and thus can efficiently be solved
via standard tools. We also investigate the case of imperfect knowledge of
localization parameters and develop robust power allocation algorithms by
taking into account both overall system uncertainty and individual parameter
uncertainties related to the location and orientation of the VLC receiver. In
addition, we address the total power minimization problem under predefined
accuracy requirements to obtain the most energy-efficient power allocation
vector for a given CRLB level. Numerical results illustrate the improvements in
localization performance achieved by employing the proposed optimal and robust
power allocation strategies over the conventional uniform and non-robust
approaches.

society. An extremely hazardous megathrust earthquake is predicted to occur
along the Nankai Trough off southwestern Japan, an economically active and
densely populated area with historical records of megathrust earthquakes.
Megathrust earthquakes are the result of a plate subduction mechanism and occur
at interplate slip-deficit (or coupling) regions. Many past studies have
attempted to capture slip-deficit rate (SDR) distributions for assessing future
earthquake disasters. However, they could not capture a total view of the
megathrust earthquake source region because they had no seafloor geodetic data.
The Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japan Coast Guard (JHOD)
has been developing a highly precise and sustainable seafloor geodetic
observation network deployed in this subduction zone to broadly obtain direct
information related to offshore SDR. Here, we present seafloor geodetic
observation data and an offshore interplate SDR distribution model. Our data
suggests that most offshore regions in this subduction zone have positive SDRs.
Specifically, our observations indicate previously unknown high-SDR regions
that are important for tsunami disaster mitigation and low-SDR regions that are
consistent with distributions of shallow slow earthquakes and subducting
seamounts. This is the first direct evidence suggesting that coupling
conditions are related to these seismological and geological phenomena. These
observations provide new fundamental information for inferring megathrust
earthquake scenarios and interpreting research on the Nankai Trough subduction
zone.

assuming the direction to the spiral pole (to the Galactic center) to be known.
Based on the results obtained, in an effort to test the new approach, we have
constructed a simplified method of solving the problem that consists in finding
the median of the values for each parameter from all possible triplets of
objects in the spiral arm segment satisfying the condition for the angular
distance between objects. Applying the method to the data on the spatial
distribution of masers in the Perseus and Scutum arms (the catalogue by Reid et
al. (2014)) has led to an estimate of $R_0 = 8.8 \pm 0.5$ kpc. The parameters
of five spiral arm segments have been determined from masers of the same

angle. The pitch angles of the arms revealed by masers are shown to generally
correlate with $R_0$ in the sense that an increase in $R_0$ leads to a growth

continuous operation between pointfree topologies and the corresponding
principle of pointfree continuity. An operation between points of pointfree
topologies is continuous if it is induced by a relation between the bases of
the topologies; this gives a rigorous condition for Brouwer's continuity
principle to hold. The principle of pointfree continuity for pointfree
topologies $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ says that any relation which induces
a continuous operation between points is a morphism from $\mathcal{S}$ to
$\mathcal{T}$. The principle holds under the assumption of bi-spatiality of
$\mathcal{S}$. When $\mathcal{S}$ is the formal Baire space or the formal unit
interval and $\mathcal{T}$ is the formal topology of natural numbers, the
principle is equivalent to spatiality of the formal Baire space and formal unit
interval, respectively. Some of the well-known connections between spatiality,
bar induction, and compactness of the unit interval are recast in terms of our
principle of continuity.
  We adopt the Minimalist Foundation as our constructive foundation, and
positive topology as the notion of pointfree topology. This allows us to
distinguish ideal objects from constructive ones, and in particular, to
interpret choice sequences as points of the formal Baire space.

signals we propose a novel approach for satellite signal authentication based
on information-theoretic security. In particular we superimpose to the
navigation signal an authentication signal containing a secret message
corrupted by artificial noise (AN), still transmitted by the satellite. We
impose the following properties: a) the authentication signal is synchronous
with the navigation signal, b) the authentication signal is orthogonal to the
navigation signal and c) the secret message is undecodable by the attacker due
to the presence of the AN. The legitimate receiver synchronizes with the
navigation signal and stores the samples of the authentication signal with the
same synchronization. After the transmission of the authentication signal,
through a separate public asynchronous authenticated channel (e.g., a secure
Internet connection) additional information is made public allowing the
receiver to a) decode the secret message, thus overcoming the effects of AN,
and b) verify the secret message. We assess the performance of the proposed
scheme by the analysis of both the secrecy capacity of the authentication
message and the attack success probability, under various attack scenarios. A
comparison with existing approaches shows the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

element scheme for the solution of the linear elastic wave equations in first
order velocity-stress formulation in two and three-space dimensions on
staggered unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The method reaches
arbitrary high order of accuracy in both space and time via the use of
space-time basis and test functions. Within the staggered mesh formulation, we
define the discrete velocity field in the control volumes of a primary mesh,
while the discrete stress tensor is defined on a face-based staggered dual
mesh. The space-time DG formulation leads to an implicit scheme that requires
the solution of a linear system for the unknown degrees of freedom at the new
time level. The number of unknowns is reduced at the aid of the Schur
complement, so that in the end only a linear system for the degrees of freedom
of the velocity field needs to be solved. Thanks to the use of a spatially
staggered mesh, the stencil of the final velocity system involves only the
element and its direct neighbors. The resulting linear system can be
efficiently solved via matrix-free iterative methods. The chosen discretization
and the linear nature of the governing PDE system lead to an unconditionally
stable scheme, which allows large time steps even for low quality meshes that
contain sliver elements. The fully discrete staggered space-time DG method is
proven to be energy stable for any order of accuracy, for any mesh and for any
time step size. For the particular case of Crank-Nicolson time discretization
and homogeneous material, the final velocity system can be proven to be
symmetric and positive definite and in this case the scheme is also exactly
energy preserving. The new scheme is applied to several test problems in two
and three space dimensions, providing also a comparison with high order
explicit ADER-DG schemes

abstraction. The main advantages of DEVS are its rigourous and precise
specification, as well as its support for modular, hierarchical construction of
models. DEVS frequently serves as a simulation ""assembly language"" to which
models in other formalisms are translated, either giving meaning to new
(domain-specific) languages, or reproducing semantics of existing languages.
Despite this rigourous definition of its syntax and semantics, initialization
of DEVS models is left unspecified in both the Classic and Parallel DEVS
formalism definition. In this paper, we extend the DEVS formalism by including
an initial total state. Extensions to syntax as well as denotational (closure
under coupling) and operational semantics (abstract simulator) are presented.
The extension is applicable to both main variants of the DEVS formalism. Our
extension is such that it adds to, but does not alter the original
specification. All changes are illustrated by means of a traffic light example.

applications, such as image detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and
speech recognition. However, this comes with a major concern: deep networks
have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples
are slightly modified inputs that are intentionally designed to cause a
misclassification by the model. In the domains of images and speech, the
modifications are so small that they are not seen or heard by humans, but
nevertheless greatly affect the classification of the model.
  Deep learning models have been successfully applied to malware detection. In
this domain, generating adversarial examples is not straightforward, as small
modifications to the bytes of the file could lead to significant changes in its
functionality and validity. We introduce a novel loss function for generating
adversarial examples specifically tailored for discrete input sets, such as
executable bytes. We modify malicious binaries so that they would be detected
as benign, while preserving their original functionality, by injecting a small
sequence of bytes (payload) in the binary file. We applied this approach to an
end-to-end convolutional deep learning malware detection model and show a high
rate of detection evasion. Moreover, we show that our generated payload is
robust enough to be transferable within different locations of the same file
and across different files, and that its entropy is low and similar to that of
benign data sections.

salinity and food availability across 3980 km of coastlines. New statistical
methods and multiple study systems at various geographical scales allowed the
uncoupling of the developmental and genetic contributions to shell shape and
made it possible to identify general relationships between blue mussel shape

We find salinity had the strongest effect on the latitudinal patterns of
Mytilus shape, producing shells that were more elongated, narrower and with
more parallel dorsoventral margins at lower salinities. Temperature and food
supply, however, were the main drivers of mussel shape heterogeneity. Our
findings revealed similar shell shape responses in Mytilus to less favourable

a mean bias and an intrinsic, log-normal scatter. We allow for correlated
scatter within the WL and SZE mass-observable relations and use simulations to
constrain priors on nuisance parameters related to bias and scatter from WL. We
constrain the normalization of the $\zeta-M_{500}$ relation,
$A_\mathrm{SZ}=12.0_{-6.7}^{+2.6}$ when using a prior on the mass slope
$B_\mathrm{SZ}$ from the latest SPT cluster cosmology analysis. Without this

external perturbations are often characterized by band touching points in the
Brillouin zone. The low-energy excitations near the degenerate band touching
points host different types of fermions while preserving the topological
protection of surface states. An interplay of different tunable topological
phases offers an insight into the evolution of the topological character. In
this paper, we study the occurrence of TQPTs as a function of hydrostatic
pressure in CdGeSb$_2$ and CdSnSb$_2$ chalcopyrites, using the first-principles
calculations. At ambient pressure, both materials are topological insulators
having a finite band gap with inverted order of Sb-$s$ and Sb-$p_x$,$p_y$
orbitals of valence bands at the $\Gamma$ point. On the application of
hydrostatic pressure the band gap reduces, and at the critical point of the
phase transition, these materials turn into Dirac semimetals. On further
increasing the pressure beyond the critical point, the band inversion is
reverted making them trivial insulators. The pressure-induced change in band
topology from non-trivial to trivial phase is also captured by L\""{u}ttinger
model Hamiltonian calculations. Our model demonstrates the critical role played
by a pressure-induced anisotropy in frontier bands in driving the phase
transitions. These theoretical findings of peculiar coexistence of multiple
topological phases in the same material provide a realistic and promising
platform for the experimental realization of the TQPT.

information extracted from tables. Every individual performance edge is
extracted from a table with citations to other papers. These extractions
resemble (noisy) outcomes of 'matches' in an incomplete tournament. We propose
several approaches to rank papers from these noisy 'match' outcomes. We show

promising representation type used in knowledge compilation. The relative
succinctness of representation types is an important subject in this area. The
aim of the paper is to identify which kind of Boolean functions can be
represented by SDDs of small size with respect to the number of variables the
functions are defined on. For this reason the sets of Boolean functions
representable by different representation types in polynomial size are
investigated and SDDs are compared with representation types from the classical
knowledge compilation map of Darwiche and Marquis. Ordered binary decision
diagrams (OBDDs) which are a popular data structure for Boolean functions are
one of these representation types. SDDs are more general than OBDDs by
definition but only recently, a Boolean function was presented with polynomial
SDD size but exponential OBDD size. This result is strengthened in several
ways. The main result is a quasipolynomial simulation of SDDs by equivalent
unambiguous nondeterministic OBDDs, a nondeterministic variant where there
exists exactly one accepting computation for each satisfying input. As a side
effect an open problem about the relative succinctness between SDDs and free
binary decision diagrams (FBDDs) which are more general than OBDDs is answered.

become adsorbed to the interface. The mechanism of adsorption is still a
subject of debate. We argue that there are two driving forces for anionic
adsorption: the hydrophobic cavitational energy and the interfacial
electrostatic surface potential of water. While the cavitational contribution
to ionic adsorption is now well accepted, the role of the electrostatic surface
potential is much less clear. The difficulty is that even the sign of this
potential is a subject of debate, with the ab initio and the classical force
field simulations predicting electrostatic surface potentials of opposite sign.
In this paper, we will argue that the strong anionic adsorption found in the
polarizable force field simulations is the result of the artificial
electrostatic surface potential present in the classical water models. We will
show that if the adsorption of anions were as large as predicted by the
polarizable force field simulations, the excess surface tension of the NaI
solution would be strongly negative, contrary to the experimental measurements.
While the large polarizability of heavy halides is a fundamental property and
must be included in realistic modeling of the electrolyte solutions, we argue
that the point charge water models, studied so far, are incompatible with the
polarizable ionic force fields when the translational symmetry is broken. The
goal for the future should be the development of water models with very low
electrostatic surface potential. We believe that such water models will be
compatible with the polarizable force fields, which can then be used to study
the interaction of ions with hydrophobic surfaces and proteins.

provide an explicit energy-based framework for modelling physical systems,

impact on the radius of the uncertainty of several quantities, namely the
equation of state, radiative opacity, atmospheric models, convection efficiency

stripe obtained by adding the radius variation due to all the analysed

stellar mass. For ZAMS structures the cumulative error stripe of very-low mass
stars is about $\pm 2$ and $\pm 3$ percent, while at larger masses it increases
up to $\pm 4$ and $\pm 5$ percent. The radius uncertainty gets larger and age
dependent if isochrones are considered, reaching for $M\sim 1$Msun about

indications for a plateau-like structure that is attributed to elastic
backscattering. To explore the relevant control mechanisms, characteristic
features, and particular signatures from near-field inhomogeneity, we performed
systematic quantum simulations employing a one-dimensional nanotip model.
Besides rich phase-dependent structures in the simulated above-threshold
ionization (ATI) photoelectron spectra we find ponderomotive shifts as well as
substantial modifications of the rescattering cutoff as function of the decay
length of the near-field. To explore the quantum or classical nature of the

electron propagation and from the ionization rate we compare the quantum
results to classical trajectory simulations. We show that signatures from
direct electrons as well as the modulations in the plateau region mainly stem

region can only be explained by the impact of the two-color field on the
electron trajectory. Despite the complexity of the phase-dependent features

Thus large-scale measurements of the red giant core rotation are of prime
importance to obtain tighter constraints on the efficiency of the internal
angular momentum transport, and to study how this efficiency changes with
stellar parameters. This work aims at identifying the components of the
rotational multiplets for dipole mixed modes in a large number of red giant
oscillation spectra observed by Kepler. Such identification provides us with a
direct measurement of the red giant mean core rotation. We compute stretched
spectra that mimic the regular pattern of pure dipole gravity modes. Mixed
modes with same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in
stretched period. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to
disentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the
mean core rotation rates of red giants. We obtained mean core rotation
measurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars
with a mass as large as 2.5 $M_{\odot}$, allowing us to test the dependence of
the core slow-down rate on the stellar mass. This work on a large sample allows

suppress plasma turbulence both in experimental and numerical studies in a
number of scenarios. Understanding the underlying physics and identifying the
range of their beneficial effect is an essential task for future fusion
reactors, where highly energetic ions are generated through fusion reactions
and external heating schemes. However, in many of the gyrokinetic codes fast
ions are, for simplicity, treated as equivalent-Maxwellian-distributed particle
species, although it is well known that to rigorously model highly
non-thermalised particles, a non-Maxwellian background distribution function is
needed. To study the impact of this assumption, the gyrokinetic code GENE has
recently been extended to support arbitrary background distribution functions
which might be either analytic, e.g. slowing down and bi-Maxwellian, or
obtained from numerical fast ion models. A particular JET plasma with strong
fast-ion related turbulence suppression is revised with these new code
capabilities both with linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. It appears
that the fast ion stabilization tends to be less strong but still substantial
with more realistic distributions, and this improves the quantitative power
balance agreement with experiments.

eight different texture combinations are compatible with neutrino data at
$1\sigma$, all of them for an inverted-hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum.
Four of these cases predict a CP-violating Dirac phase close to $3\pi/2$, which

considering three equal elements in the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix,
several texture combinations are still compatible with data but only at

Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which provides an interesting example of
algebraicity of generating functions of these invariants. We also find a

to investigate the evolution of the solar wind. Recently, it has been suggested
that winds of solar type stars might undergo a change in properties at old
ages, whereby stars older than the Sun would be less efficient in carrying away
angular momentum than what was traditionally believed. Adding to this, recent
observations suggest that old solar-type stars show a break in coronal
properties, with a steeper decay in X-ray luminosities and temperatures at
older ages. We use these X-ray observations to constrain the thermal
acceleration of winds of solar analogues. Our sample is based on the stars from
the `Sun in time' project with ages between 120-7000 Myr. The break in X-ray
properties leads to a break in wind mass-loss rates ($\dot{M}$) at roughly 2
Gyr, with $\dot{M}$ (t < 2 Gyr) $\propto t^{-0.74}$ and $\dot{M}$ (t > 2 Gyr)
$\propto$ $t^{-3.9}$. This steep decay in $\dot{M}$ at older ages could be the
reason why older stars are less efficient at carrying away angular momentum,
which would explain the anomalously rapid rotation observed in older stars. We
also show that none of the stars in our sample would have winds dense enough to
produce thermal emission above 1-2 GHz, explaining why their radio emissions
have not yet been detected. Combining our models with dynamo evolution models
for the magnetic field of the Earth we find that, at early ages ($\approx$100
Myr) our Earth had a magnetosphere that was 3 or more times smaller than its
current size.

optional quantization boundaries, a 2-bit quantized hard-decision decoder is
proposed to outperform the hard-decoded LDPC bit-flipping decoder with fewer

complexity compared to LDPC codes. The stepwise maximum mutual information

consider what is required for a replication study to confirm the original
experiment and apply this understanding in software engineering. METHOD:
Simulation is used to demonstrate why the prediction interval for confirmation
can be surprisingly wide. This analysis is applied to three recent
replications. RESULTS: It is shown that because the prediction intervals are
wide, almost all replications are confirmatory, so in that sense there is no
'replication crisis', however, the contributions to knowledge are negligible.

a microscopic collision model. We consider a bipartite system consisting of two
identical subsystems, and each subsystem interacts with its own local
reservoir, which consists of a large collection of initially uncorrelated
ancillas. Then a heat transport is formed between two reservoirs by a sequence
of pairwise collisions (inter-subsystem and subsystem-local reservoir). In this
paper we consider two kinds of reservoir's initial states, the thermal state,
and the state with coherence whose diagonal elements are the same as that of
the thermal state and the off-diaganal elements are nonzero. In this way, we
define the effective temperature of the reservoir with coherence according to
its diagonal elements. We find that for two reservoirs having coherence the
direction of the steady current of heat is different for different phase
differences between the two initial states of two reservoirs, especially the
heat can transfer from the ""cold reservoir"" to the ""hot reservoir"" in the
steady regime for particular phase difference. And in the limit of the
effective temperature difference between the two reservoirs $\Delta
T\rightarrow0$, for most of the phase differences, the steady heat current
increases with the increase of effective temperature until to the high
effective temperature limit; while for the thermal state or particular phase
difference the steady heat current decreases with the increase of temperature
at high temperatures, and in this case the conductance can be obtained.

patterns, the bike imbalance problem constantly occurs, especially for dockless
bike sharing systems, causing significant impact on service quality and company
revenue. Thus, it has become a critical task for bike sharing systems to
resolve such imbalance efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel deep

Different from existing methods that often ignore spatial information and rely
heavily on accurate prediction, HRP captures both spatial and temporal
dependencies using a divide-and-conquer structure with an embedded localized
module. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HRP, based on a dataset
from Mobike, a major Chinese dockless bike sharing company. Results show that
HRP performs close to the 24-timeslot look-ahead optimization, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both service level and bike distribution. It also
transfers well when applied to unseen areas.

probably the oldest and most ubiquitous phenomenon underpinning technological
applications of magnetism. It is a macroscopic non-equilibrium phenomenon: a
remanent magnetisation appears when a magnetic field is applied to an initially
unmagnetised ferromagnet, and then taken away. Here, we present an inverted
magnetic hysteresis loop in the pyrochlore compound Nd$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$: the
remanent magnetisation points in a direction opposite to the applied field.
This phenomenon is exquisitely tunable as a function of the protocol in field
and temperature, and it is reproducible as in a quasi-equilibrium setting. We
account for this phenomenon in considerable detail in terms of the properties
of non-equilibrium population of domain walls which exhibit a magnetic moment
between domains of an ordered antiferromagnetic state which itself has zero net
magnetisation. Properties and (non-equilibrium) dynamics of topological defects
play an important role in modern spintronics, and our study adds an instance
where a uniform field couples selectively to domain walls rather than the bulk.

for a cost-effective manufacturing. Too fast, it does not favor the application
of the product and the control of bonded joints. Too slow, it leads to long
process times and too high process costs. The best compromises are
two-component adhesives that cure slowly at room temperature and can reach full
polymerization in minutes, on demand. In this paper, the curing behavior of a
model poly-epoxide adhesive (a stoichiometric mixture of a pure epoxy and
amine) polymerized with infrared radiation will be studied. The kinetic
follow-up of this polymerization will be carried out by thermal analysis
(determination of the residual heat peak by Differential Scanning
Calorimetry-DSC). This study paves the way to a cold and universal
cure-on-demand process, which means achieved in few minutes at low temperature
without any initiators, catalysts or accelerators. Basically, infrared curing
can be possible thanks to an increase in temperature (called thermal effect).
But it has been shown that a ""non-thermal effect"" could also be involved in
accelerating kinetics with infrared. This increase due to a non-thermal effect,
suggested as a function of the infrared radiative flux, has been shown to be
possible thanks to the absorption of infrared radiation, leading to a reduction
in the energy barrier of the primary epoxy/amine reaction.

electric polarization promises new device functionalities. A versatile approach
is presented here for generating and controlling open circuit magnonic spin
currents and an effective multiferroicity at a uniform temperature with the aid
of spatially inhomogeneous, external, static electric fields. This field
applied to a ferromagnetic insulator with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type coupling
changes locally the magnon dispersion and modifies the density of thermally
excited magnons in a region of the scale of the field inhomogeneity. The
resulting gradient in the magnon density can be viewed as a gradient in the
effective magnon temperature. This effective thermal gradient together with
local magnon dispersion result in an open-circuit, electric field controlled
magnonic spin current. In fact, for a moderate variation in the external
electric field the predicted magnonic spin current is on the scale of the spin
(Seebeck) current generated by a comparable external temperature gradient.
Analytical methods supported by full-fledge numerics confirm that both, a
finite temperature and an inhomogeneous electric field are necessary for this
emergent non-equilibrium phenomena. The proposal can be integrated in magnonic
and multiferroic circuits, for instance to convert heat into electrically
controlled pure spin current using for example nanopatterning, without the need
to generate large thermal gradients on the nanoscale.

convex and compact polytope in terms of the magnitude of violation of the
constraints. Recently, several results showed that Hoffman's bound can be used
to derive strongly-convex-like rates for first-order methods for
\textit{offline} convex optimization of curved, though not strongly convex,
functions, over polyhedral sets. In this work, we use this classical result for
the first time to obtain faster rates for \textit{online convex optimization}
over polyhedral sets with curved convex, though not strongly convex, loss
functions. We show that under several reasonable assumptions on the data, the
standard \textit{Online Gradient Descent} algorithm guarantees logarithmic
regret. To the best of our knowledge, the only previous algorithm to achieve
logarithmic regret in the considered settings is the \textit{Online Newton
Step} algorithm which requires quadratic (in the dimension) memory and at least
quadratic runtime per iteration, which greatly limits its applicability to
large-scale problems. In particular, our results hold for
\textit{semi-adversarial} settings in which the data is a combination of an
arbitrary (adversarial) sequence and a stochastic sequence, which might provide
reasonable approximation for many real-world sequences, or under a natural
assumption that the data is low-rank. We demonstrate via experiments that the
regret of OGD is indeed comparable to that of ONS (and even far better) on
curved though not strongly-convex losses.

communications. Because these applications demand wide angle beam steering as
well as high optical power in the output beam, a natural design choice would be
to space the array emitters at a half-wavelength pitch, as is common in
radiofrequency phased arrays. Optical phased arrays, however, unlike RF phased
arrays, have been limited by the tradeoff between field of view (i.e. angle
steering) and beamforming efficiency (i.e. optical power in the output beam).
This tradeoff exists because optical phased arrays rely on waveguides as
emitters, which suffer from strong crosstalk when placed in close proximity
relative to their mode size. Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate
a platform for optical phased arrays with 180{\deg} field of view, where more
than 72 percent of the power is carried in a single diffraction-limited beam
even when steered up to 60{\deg} off-axis. Our platform leverages high
index-contrast, dispersion-engineered waveguides spaced one half-wavelength
apart without incurring crosstalk.

model for predicting new associations via graph embedding of the nodes of data
vectors with links of their associations. Multi-view data vectors with
many-to-many associations are transformed by neural networks to feature vectors
in a shared space, and the probability of new association between two data

existing multi-view feature learning techniques can treat only either of
many-to-many association or non-linear transformation, PMvGE can treat both
simultaneously. By combining Mercer's theorem and the universal approximation
theorem, we prove that PMvGE learns a wide class of similarity measures across

non-linear transformations of data vectors in large-scale datasets by minibatch
SGD, and numerical experiments illustrate that PMvGE outperforms existing

for interpreting a substantial number of observations of quasi-periodic signals

spectra of these wave trains in coronal tubes depend crucially on the
dispersive properties of trapped sausage waves, the existence of cutoff axial
wavenumbers and the monotonicity of the dependence of the axial group speed on
the axial wavenumber in particular. This study examines the difference a slab
geometry may introduce, for which purpose we conduct a comprehensive eigenmode
analysis, both analytically and numerically, on trapped sausage modes in
coronal slabs with a considerable number of density profiles. For the profile
descriptions examined, coronal slabs can trap sausage waves with longer axial
wavelengths, and the group speed approaches the internal Alfv\'en speed more
rapidly at large wavenumbers in the cylindrical case. However, common to both
geometries, cutoff wavenumbers exist only when the density profile falls
sufficiently rapidly at distances far from coronal structures. Likewise, the
monotonicity of the group speed curves depends critically on the profile
steepness right at the structure axis. Furthermore, the Morlet spectra of the
wave trains are shaped by the group speed curves for coronal slabs and tubes
alike. Consequently, we conclude that these spectra have the potential for
telling the sub-resolution density structuring inside coronal structures,
although their detection requires an instrumental cadence of better than $\sim

possible solution to this problem is to employ community contributed text tags
as weak labels, however, the concepts underlying a single text tag strongly
depends on the users. We instead present a new paradigm for learning
discriminative features by making full use of the human curation process on
social networking services (SNSs). During the process of content curation, SNS
users collect content items manually from various sources and group them by
context, all for their own benefit. Due to the nature of this process, we can
assume that (1) content items in the same group share the same semantic concept
and (2) groups sharing the same images might have related semantic concepts.
Through these insights, we can define human curated groups as weak labels from
which our proposed framework can learn discriminative features as a
representation in the space of semantic concepts the users intended when
creating the groups. We show that this feature learning can be formulated as a
problem of link prediction for a bipartite graph whose nodes corresponds to
content items and human curated groups, and propose a novel method for feature
learning based on sparse coding or network fine-tuning.

typically relies on uniform time sampling and assumes infinite-precision

based on uniform amplitude sampling with assumed infinite precision timing
information. The approach is based on the delta-ramp encoder which consists of
applying a one-level level-crossing detector to the result of adding an
appropriate sawtooth-like waveform to the input signal. The output samples are
the time instants of these level crossings, thus representing a time-encoded
version of the input signal. For theoretical purposes, this system can be
equivalently analyzed by reversibly transforming through ramp addition a
nonmonotonic input signal into a monotonic one which is then uniformly sampled
in amplitude. The monotonic function is then represented by the times at which
the signal crosses a predefined and equally-spaced set of amplitude values. We
refer to this technique as amplitude sampling. The time sequence generated can
be interpreted alternatively as nonuniform time sampling of the original source
signal. We derive duality and frequency-domain properties for the functions
involved in the transformation. Iterative algorithms are proposed and
implemented for recovery of the original source signal. As indicated in the
simulations, the proposed iterative amplitude-sampling algorithm achieves a
faster convergence rate than frame-based reconstruction for nonuniform
sampling. The performance can also be improved by appropriate choice of the
parameters while maintaining the same sampling density.

To search for evidence of a field-induced PDW in cuprates, we visualize the
modulations in the density of electronic states $N(\bf{r})$ within the halo
surrounding Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ vortex cores. This reveals multiple

theory for a field-induced primary PDW that generates secondary CDWs within the

properties. The proposed EH is applied to protein residue networks for protein
thermal fluctuation analysis, rendering the most accurate B-factor prediction
of a set of 364 proteins. This work extends the utility of dynamical systems to
the quantitative modeling and analysis of realistic physical systems.

positron anomaly (PA) in cosmic rays (CR). The main difficulty in PA
explanation relates to cosmic gamma-radiation which is inevitably produced in
DM annihilation or decay leading to tension with respective observation data.
Introduction of ""active"" (producing CR) DM component concentrating in galactic
disk alleviates this tension. Earlier we considered two-lepton modes, with
branching ratios being chosen to fit in the best way all the observation data.
Here we considered, in framework of the same dark disk model, two cases:
two-body final state annihilation and four-body one, and in each case a quark
mode is added to the leptonic ones. It is shown that 4-body mode case is a
little better than 2-body one from viewpoint of quality of observation data
description at the fixed all other parameters (of CR propagation, background,
disk height). The values of DM particle mass around 350 GeV and 500 GeV are
more favourable for 2- and 4-body modes respectively. Higher values would
improve description of data on positrons only but accounting for data on
gamma-radiation prevents it because of unwanted more abundant high-energy gamma
production. Inclusion of the quark modes improves a little fitting data in both
4- and 2-body mode cases, contrary to naive expectations. In fact, quark mode
has a bigger gammas yield than that of most gamma-productive leptonic mode~---
tau, but they are softer due to bigger final state hadron multiplicity.

constant scaling layer and simplify other components that are arduous for
integer implementation. Improved accuracies can be obtained on multiple

Empirically, we demonstrate the potential to deploy training in hardware

with comparable accuracy and higher energy efficiency, which is crucial to
future AI applications in variable scenarios with transfer and continual

the first large-scale data set for idiom translation. Our data set is
automatically extracted from a widely used German-English translation corpus

and the fraction that is detectable via single pulse and periodicity searches.
Additionally, we explore the distributions of flux densities and dispersion

surveys. This population would be most effectively probed by surveys using
time-domain periodicity search algorithms. The current non-detections of
pulsars in the halo can be explained if we assume that the inclination angle

confusion between bright pulses from halo pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts with
low dispersion measures where further follow-up is warranted.

development of robust and scalable, electrically addressable spin qubits on

and an optional choice of reference frame at each instant. As the splitting is
done via the observer's past light cone, it is both closer to the experimental
situation and mathematically less restrictive than the splitting via observer
vector fields or spacelike hypersurfaces. Indeed, the theory can in principle
be applied to all spacetimes and adapted to other `metric' theories of gravity.
Instructive examples are developed along with the general theory. In
particular, we obtain an alternative description for accelerated frames of
reference in Minkowski spacetime.
  Further, we use the splitting formalism to motivate a new mathematical
approach to the Newtonian limit of the motion of mass points. This employs a
general formula for their observed motion, distinguishing between `actual'
forces (i.e. those detectable via an accelerometer) and pseudo-forces. Via this
formula we show that for inertial frames of reference in Minkowski spacetime
the essential laws of non-gravitational Newtonian mechanics can be derived.
  Physically relevant, related, open problems are indicated throughout the
text. These include the proof, that the Newtonian limit gives rise to the
central pseudo-forces known from Newtonian mechanics (`constant gravity',
Euler, Coriolis and centrifugal force) for non-inertial frames of reference in

Attachment (SPA) model introduced by Aiello et al. in 2009. This model
naturally combines geometry and preferential attachment using the notion of
spheres of influence. It was previously shown in several research papers that
graphs generated by the SPA model are similar to real-world networks in many
aspects. For example, the vertex degree distribution was shown to follow a
power law. In the current paper, we study the behaviour of C(d), which is the
average local clustering coefficient for the vertices of degree d. This
characteristic was not previously analyzed in the SPA model. However, it was
empirically shown that in real-world networks C(d) usually decreases as d^{-a}
for some a>0 and it was often observed that a=1. We prove that in the SPA model
C(d) decreases as 1/d. Furthermore, we are also able to prove that not only the
average but the individual local clustering coefficient of a vertex v of degree
d behaves as 1/d if d is large enough. The obtained results are illustrated by
numerous experiments with simulated graphs.

very near to the sound source in order to capture more direct sound and
minimize any pickup of ambient sound, including other, concurrently active

recording, based on a number of empirical rules that were evolved during the

practice be systematically verified? In this work we aim to address this
question based on an analytic methodology that employs techniques and metrics
originating from the sound source separation evaluation field. In particular,
we apply a quantitative analysis of the source separation capabilities of the
close miking technique. The analysis is applied on a recording dataset obtained
at multiple positions of a typical musical hall, multiple distances between the
microphone and the sound source multiple microphone types and multiple level
differences between the sound source and the ambient acoustic component. For
all the above cases we compute the Source to Interference Ratio (SIR) metric.
The results obtained clearly demonstrate an optimum close-miking performance

carry in any dimension a half integer spin. There are two kinds of spins in
Clifford space. The spin-charge-family theory,assuming even d=13+1, uses one
kind of spins to describe in d=3+1 spins and charges of quarks and leptons and
antiquarks and antileptons, while the other kind is used to describe families.
The new way of second quantization, suggested by the spin-charge-family theory,
is presented. It is shown that the creation and annihilation operators of
1-fermion states, written as products of nilpotents and projectors of an odd
Clifford character, fulfill the anticommutation relations as required in the
second quantization procedure for fermions: 1-fermion states are in Clifford
space already second quantized, the creation operators for any n-fermion second
quantized vectors are products of one fermion creation operators, operating on
the empty vacuum state. It is demonstrated that also in Grassmann space there
exist the creation and annihilation operators of an odd Grassmann character,
generating ""fermions"", which fulfill as well the anticommutation relations for
fermions, representing correspondingly the second quantized 1-""fermion"" states,
in this case with integer spins. Grassmann space offers no families. We discuss
the new second quantization procedure of the fields in both spaces. For the
Grassmann case we present the action, basic states, solutions of the Weyl
equation for free massless ""fermions"" and discrete symmetry operators. A short
overview of the achievements of the spin-charge-family theory is done, and open
problems of this theory still waiting to be solved are presented. The Grassmann
and the Clifford case are compared in order to better understand open questions
in physics of elementary fermion and boson fields and in cosmology.

  To guide the encoder-decoder attentional model to learn this difficult
problem, we propose a structured-based curriculum learning strategy.
  Unlike conventional curriculum learning that gradually emphasizes difficult
data examples, we formalize learning strategies from easier network structures
to more difficult network structures. Here, we start the training with
end-to-end encoder-decoder for speech recognition or text-based machine
translation task then gradually move to end-to-end speech translation task. The
experiment results show that the proposed approach could provide significant
improvements in comparison with the one without curriculum learning.

a signal into additive parts such that each part has distinct sparse
representation within a corresponding dictionary. Both the SC task and its
generalization via MCA have been cast as $\ell_1$-regularized least-squares
optimization problems. To accelerate traditional acquisition of sparse codes,
we propose a deep learning architecture that constitutes a trainable
time-unfolded version of the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm
(SALSA), a special case of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). We empirically validate both variants of the algorithm, that we refer
to as LSALSA (learned-SALSA), on image vision tasks and demonstrate that at
inference our networks achieve vast improvements in terms of the running time,
the quality of estimated sparse codes, and visual clarity on both classic SC

LSALSA network: we show that the proposed approach exactly implements a
truncated ADMM applied to a new, learned cost function with curvature modified
by one of the learned parameterized matrices. We extend a very recent
Stochastic Alternating Optimization analysis framework to show that a gradient
descent step along this learned loss landscape is equivalent to a modified
gradient descent step along the original loss landscape. In this framework, the
acceleration achieved by LSALSA could potentially be explained by the network's
ability to learn a correction to the gradient direction of steeper descent.

Recognition (FR) system, one needs to build \textit{substitute} models to
simulate the target model, so the adversarial examples discovered from
substitute models could also mislead the target model. Such
\textit{transferability} is achieved in recent studies through querying the
target model to obtain data for training the substitute models. A real-world
target, likes the FR system of law enforcement, however, is less accessible to
the adversary. To attack such a system, a substitute model with similar quality
as the target model is needed to identify their common defects. This is hard
since the adversary often does not have the enough resources to train such a
powerful model (hundreds of millions of images and rooms of GPUs are needed to
train a commercial FR system).
  We found in our research, however, that a resource-constrained adversary
could still effectively approximate the target model's capability to recognize
\textit{specific} individuals, by training \textit{biased} substitute models on
additional images of those victims whose identities the attacker want to cover

\textit{Nearly Local Linearity} (NLL), which models the observation that an
ideal DNN model produces the image representations (embeddings) whose distances
among themselves truthfully describe the human perception of the differences
among the input images. By simulating this property around the victim's images,
we significantly improve the transferability of black-box impersonation attacks
by nearly 50\%. Particularly, we successfully attacked a commercial system

  Mediating Frequency Band",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.DM stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The functional significance of resting state networks and their abnormal
manifestations in psychiatric disorders are firmly established, as is the
importance of the cortical rhythms in mediating these networks. Resting state
networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to
adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by
separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric
conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of
resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent),
we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta
(13-30Hz) and gamma (31-80Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated
networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated
networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age
in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in
beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance
with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with
those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks.
These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of
cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.

system. Due to budget and time constraints, engineers typically rely on
engineering judgment and prior experience when selecting a structural system,
often considering a limited range of design alternatives. The objective of this
study was to explore the suitability of supervised machine learning as a
preliminary design aid that provides guidance to engineers with regards to the
statistically optimal bridge type to choose, ultimately improving the
likelihood of optimized design, design standardization, and reduced maintenance
costs. In order to devise this supervised learning system, data for over
600,000 bridges from the National Bridge Inventory database were analyzed. Key
attributes for determining the bridge structure type were identified through
three feature selection techniques. Potentially useful attributes like seismic
intensity and historic data on the cost of materials (steel and concrete) were
then added from the US Geological Survey (USGS) database and Engineering News
Record. Decision tree, Bayes network and Support Vector Machines were used for
predicting the bridge design type. Due to state-to-state variations in material
availability, material costs, and design codes, supervised learning models
based on the complete data set did not yield favorable results. Supervised
learning models were then trained and tested using 10-fold cross validation on
data for each state. Inclusion of seismic data improved the model performance
noticeably. The data was then resampled to reduce the bias of the models
towards more common design types, and the supervised learning models thus
constructed showed further improvements in performance. The average recall and
precision for the state models was 88.6% and 88.0% using Decision Trees, 84.0%
and 83.7% using Bayesian Networks, and 80.8% and 75.6% using SVM.
