the first 2 months following discovery. We report the detection of first
overtone carbon monoxide emission at $\sim58.2$ d after discovery, one of the
earliest detections of CO in an erupting supernova. We model the CO emission to
derive the CO mass, temperature and velocity, assuming both pure $^{12}$CO and
a composition that includes $^{13}$CO; the case for the latter is the isotopic
analyses of meteoritic grains, which suggest that core collapse supernovae can
synthesise significant amounts of $^{13}$C. Our models show that, while the CO
data are adequately explained by pure $^{12}$CO, they do not preclude the
presence of $^{13}$CO, to a limit of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C $> 3$, the first
constraint on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio determined from near-infrared
observations. We estimate the reddening to the object, and the effective
temperature from the energy distribution at outburst. We discuss whether the
ejecta of SN 2016adj may be carbon-rich, what the infrared data tell us about
the classification of this supernova, and what implications the early formation
of CO in supernovae may have for CO formation in supernovae in general.

which include several families of high-temperature superconductors and
resistive switching systems. We address the question of why strongly correlated
d-wave superconductors, such as the cuprates, prove to be surprisingly robust
against the introduction of non-magnetic impurities. We show that, very
generally, both the pair-breaking and the normal state transport scattering
rates are significantly suppressed by strong correlations effects arising in
the proximity to a Mott insulating state. We also show that the
correlation-renormalized scattering amplitude is generically enhanced in the
forward direction, an effect which was previously often ascribed to the
specific scattering by charged impurities outside the copper-oxide planes. We
provide the theoretical insights for resistive switching systems and show how
impurities and underlying correlations can play significant roles in practical
devices. We report the striking result of a connection between the resistive
switching and shock wave formation, a classic topic of non-linear dynamics. We
argue that the profile of oxygen vacancies that migrate during the commutation
forms a shock wave that propagates through a highly resistive region of the
device. We validate the scenario by means of model simulations and experiments
in a manganese-oxide based memristor device and we extend our theory to the
case of binary oxides. The shock wave scenario brings unprecedented physical
insight and enables to rationalize the process of oxygen-vacancy-driven
resistive change with direct implications for a key technological aspect- the
commutation speed.

  Models",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a method which enables a recurrent dynamics model to be
temporally abstract. Our approach, which we call Adaptive Skip Intervals (ASI),
is based on the observation that in many sequential prediction tasks, the exact
time at which events occur is irrelevant to the underlying objective. Moreover,
in many situations, there exist prediction intervals which result in
particularly easy-to-predict transitions. We show that there are prediction
tasks for which we gain both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy
by allowing the model to make predictions at a sampling rate which it can
choose itself.

  the validity of the Hertzian model",,,"10.1021/acs.macromol.9b00099",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important open problem in materials science is whether a direct connection
exists between single-particle elastic properties and the macroscopic bulk
behavior. Here we address this question by focusing on the archetype of soft
colloids: thermoresponsive microgels. These colloidal-sized polymer networks
are often assumed to interact through a simple Hertzian potential, a classic
model in linear elasticity theory. By developing an appropriate methodology,
that can be generalized to any kind of soft particle, we are able to calculate
all the elastic moduli of non-ionic microgels across their volume phase
transition (VPT). Remarkably, we reproduce many features seen in experiments,
including the appearance of a minimum of the Poisson's ratio close to the VPT.
By calculating the particle-particle effective interactions and the resulting
collective behavior, we find that the Hertzian model works well up to moderate
values of the packing fraction.

during its 2014 outburst based on MAXI/GSC and Swift/XRT observations. Over the
course of the outburst, a transition from the low/hard state to the high/soft
state and then back to the low/hard state was seen. During the high/soft state,
the innermost disk temperature mildly decreased, while the innermost radius
estimated with the multi-color disk model remained constant at $\sim18\
(\frac{D}{8.5\ \mathrm{kpc}}) \ {(\frac{\cos i}{\cos 30^{\circ}})}^{-1/2}$ km,
where $D$ is the source distance and $i$ is the inclination of observation.
This small innermost radius of the accretion disk suggests that the central
object is more likely to be a Kerr black hole rather than a Schwardzschild
black hole. Applying a relativistic disk emission model to the high/soft state
spectra, a mass upper limit of $18.3\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ was obtained based on
the inclination limit $i<60^{\circ}$ for an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc. Using
the empirical relation of the transition luminosity to the Eddington limit, the
mass is constrained to $4.0-18.3\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ for the same distance.
The mass can be further constrained to be no larger than $9.5\
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ by adopting the constraints based on the fits to the NuSTAR
spectra with relativistically blurred disk reflection models (Miller et al.

as K such that for any connected graphs G,H with odd cycles C,C', a
homomorphism from $(G \times C') \cup (C \times H) \subseteq G \times H$ to K
implies a homomorphism from G or H.
  Strong multiplicativity of K also implies the following property, which may
be of independent interest: if G is non-bipartite, H is a connected graph with
a vertex h, and there is a homomorphism $\phi \colon G \times H \to K$ such
that $\phi(-,h)$ is constant, then H admits a homomorphism to K.
  All graphs currently known to be multiplicative are strongly multiplicative.
We revisit the proofs in a different view based on covering graphs and replace
fragments with more combinatorial arguments. This allows us to find new
(strongly) multiplicative graphs: all graphs in which every edge is in at most
square, and the third power of any graph of girth >12. Though more graphs are
amenable to our methods, they still make no progress for the case of cliques.
Instead we hope to understand their limits, perhaps hinting at ways to further
extend them.

power factor at low temperature, making it a leading candidate for cryogenic

controversial, having been variously attributed to electronic correlations as
well as the phonon-drag effect. The optical properties of a material provide
information on both the electronic and vibrational properties. The optical
conductivity reveals an anisotropic response at room temperature; the
low-frequency optical conductivity decreases rapidly with temperature,
signalling a metal-insulator transition. One-dimensional semiconducting
behavior is observed along the $b$ axis at low temperature, in agreement with
first-principle calculations. The infrared-active lattice vibrations are also
symmetric and extremely narrow, indicating long phonon relaxation times and a
lack of electron-phonon coupling. Surprisingly, there are more lattice modes
along the $a$ axis than are predicted from group theory; several of these modes
undergo significant changes below about 100 K, hinting at a weak structural
distortion or phase transition. While the extremely narrow phonon line shapes
favor the phonon-drag effect, the one-dimensional behavior of this system at
low temperature may also contribute to the extraordinarily high thermopower
observed in this material.

of a turbulent cloud with the hot, pressurised gas in a superbubble. The hot
gas fills the tenuous regions of the cloud and compresses the denser parts.
Stars formed in these dense clumps would have distinct spatial and kinematic
distributions. The combined results from observations and simulations are
consistent with a scenario where dense gas was initially distributed in a band
elongated in the direction now occupied by the OB association. Superbubbles
powered by massive stars would then repeatedly break out of the elongated
parent cloud, surround and squash the denser parts of the gas sheet and thus
induce more star formation. The expected spatial and kinematic distribution of
stars is consistent with observations of Sco-Cen. The scenario might apply to
many similar regions in the Galaxy and also to AGN-related superbubbles.

profile, but with an outside-in radial velocity profile, where the peak infall
speeds are at large radii, in lower density gas, with cloud-to-core accretion,
and no hydrostatic outer envelope. Using optically thick HCO$^+$ J=1-0 and 3-2
rotational lines, we consider several ""typical"" beamwidths and use a simple
line-fitting model to infer infall speeds from the synthetic profiles similarly
to what is done in standard line modeling. We find that the inferred infall

downweighted by the low density gas in which they occur, due to the outside-in
nature of the actual radial collapse profile. Also, with the N$_2$H$^+$

sizes which are a factor few too large for their luminosities, apparently at
odds with the standard model. Here, we investigate the likely contribution to
the measured delay signature of diffuse continuum emission arising from broad
line region gas. We start by constructing spherically symmetric pressure-law
BLR models (i.e., $P(r)\propto r^{-s}$) that approximately reproduce the
observed emission line fluxes of the strong UV--optical emission-lines in the
best-studied source, NGC~5548. We then determine the contribution of the
diffuse continuum to the measured continuum flux and inter-band delays,
accounting for the observed variability behaviour of the ionizing nuclear
continuum. Those pressure-law models that approximately reproduce the observed
emission-line luminosities unavoidably produce substantial diffuse continuum
emission. This causes a significant contamination of the disk reverberation
signature (i.e., wavelength-dependent continuum delays). Qualitatively, the
diffuse continuum delay signatures produced by our models resemble that
observed for NGC~5548, including the deviation of the lag spectrum above that
of a simple power-law in wavelength, short-ward of the Balmer and Paschen
jumps. Furthermore, for reasonable estimates of the BLR covering fraction, the
delay induced by diffuse continuum emission causes elevated inter-band delays
over the entire UV--optical regime; for these pressure-law models, there are no
`disk-dominated' wavelength intervals. Thus, the diffuse continuum contribution
must be taken into account in order to correctly infer AGN accretion disk sizes
based on inter-band continuum delays.

are task-dependent and can not be generalized for different tasks. We further
observe that embedding obtained after considering all the node and relation

We will briefly review earlier techniques but mainly focus on Full Waveform
Inversion (FWI) for the acoustic formulation. FWI is a PDE constrained
optimization in which the variable velocity in a forward wave equation is
adjusted such that the solution matches measured data on the surface. The
minimization of the mismatch is usually coupled with the adjoint state method,
which also includes the solution to an adjoint wave equation. The least-squares
norm is the conventional objective function measuring the difference between
simulated and measured data, but it often results in the minimization trapped
in local minima. One way to mitigate this is by selecting another misfit
function with better convexity properties. Here we propose using the quadratic
Wasserstein metric as a new misfit function in FWI. The optimal map defining
the quadratic Wasserstein metric can be computed by solving a Monge-Ampere
equation. Theorems pointing to the advantages of using optimal transport over

nuclear bremsstrahlung processes are suppressed. The PBF processes in neutron
stars have also been used to set upper limits on the properties of axions,
which are comparable to those set by supernova SN 1987A. We apply this

of the SM Higgs boson and a light Higgs boson. We compare the Goldstone boson
emissivity with that of the neutrinos by considering several superfluid gap

graph $G=(V, E)$, can we quickly determine whether the graph can be partitioned
into a few clusters with good inner conductance, or is far from any such graph?
This is a generalization of the well-studied problem of testing graph
expansion, where one wants to distinguish between the graph having good
expansion (i.e.\ being a good single cluster) and the graph having a sparse cut
(i.e.\ being a union of at least two clusters). A recent work of Czumaj, Peng,
and Sohler (STOC'15) gave an ingenious sublinear time algorithm for testing
$k$-clusterability in time $\tilde{O}(n^{1/2} \text{poly}(k))$: their algorithm
implicitly embeds a random sample of vertices of the graph into Euclidean
space, and then clusters the samples based on estimates of Euclidean distances
between the points. This yields a very efficient testing algorithm, but only
works if the cluster structure is very strong: it is necessary to assume that
the gap between conductances of accepted and rejected graphs is at least
logarithmic in the size of the graph $G$. In this paper we show how one can
leverage more refined geometric information, namely angles as opposed to
distances, to obtain a sublinear time tester that works even when the gap is a
sufficiently large constant. Our tester is based on the singular value

rings is an idempotent when viewed in the correct endomorphism ring; so one
speaks of a separability idempotent, as one usually does for separable
algebras. It is proven that this idempotent is full if and only the H-depth is
1 (H-separable extension). Similarly, a split extension has a bimodule
projection; this idempotent is full if and only if the ring extension has depth
1 (centrally projective extension). Separable and split extensions have
separability idempotents and bimodule projections in 1 - 1 correspondence via
an endomorphism ring theorem in Section~3. If the separable idempotent is
unique, then the separable extension is called uniquely separable. A Frobenius
extension with invertible $E$-index is uniquely separable if the centralizer
equals the center of the over-ring. It is also shown that a uniquely separable
extension of semisimple complex algebras with invertible E-index has depth 1.
Earlier group-theoretic results are recovered and related to depth $1$. The
dual notion, uniquely split extension, only occurs trivially for finite group
algebra extensions over complex numbers.

profile of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007A emission line to test the validity of using
its width as a surrogate for $\sigma_{\star}$. Such an approach has often been
used in the literature, since it is difficult to measure $\sigma_{\star}$ for
type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) due to the AGN continuum outshining the
stellar-absorption lines. Fitting the [OIII] line with a single Gaussian or
Gauss-Hermite polynomials overestimates $\sigma_{\star}$ by 50-100%. When line
asymmetries from non-gravitational gas motion are excluded in a double Gaussian
fit, the average ratio between the core [OIII] width ($\sigma_{\rm
{[OIII],D}}$) and $\sigma_{\star}$ is $\sim$1, but with individual data points
off by up to a factor of two. The resulting black-hole-mass-$\sigma_{\rm

reverberation-mapped AGNs. However, a direct comparison between
$\sigma_{\star}$ and $\sigma_{\rm {[OIII],D}}$ shows no close correlation, only
that both quantities have the same range, average and standard deviation,
probably because they feel the same gravitational potential. The large scatter
is likely due to the fact that line profiles are a luminosity-weighted average,
dependent on the light distribution and underlying kinematic field. Within the
range probed by our sample (80-260 km s$^{-1}$), our results strongly caution
against the use of [OIII] width as a surrogate for $\sigma_{\star}$ on an

both gravitational waves and coincident electromagnetic counterparts. If the
BNS total mass is larger than a threshold value, a black hole ensues promptly
after merger. Through a statistical study in conjunction with recent LIGO/Virgo
constraints on the nuclear equation of state, we estimate that up to $\sim
25\%$ of BNS mergers may result in prompt collapse. Moreover, we find that most
models of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of
prompt-collapse BNS mergers have $q\gtrsim 0.8$. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers
with mass ratio $q \gtrsim 0.8$ may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae
or short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and
form negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such
BNS mergers ""orphan"". However, recent studies have found that
${10^{41-43}(B_p/10^{12}\rm G)^2 erg\, s^{-1}}$ electromagnetic signals can be
powered by magnetospheric interactions several milliseconds prior to merger.
Moreover, the energy stored in the magnetosphere of an orphan BNS merger
remnant will be radiated away in ${\mathcal O}(1\ \rm ms)$. Through simulations
in full general relativity of BNSs endowed with an initial dipole
magnetosphere, we find that the energy in the magnetosphere following black
hole formation is $E_B \sim 10^{39-41} (B_p/10^{12}\rm G)^2$ erg. Radiating
$\sim 1\%$ of $E_B$ in 1 ms, as has been found in previous studies, matches the
premerger magnetospheric luminosity. These magnetospheric signals are not
beamed, and their duration and power agrees with those of non-repeating fast
radio bursts (FRBs). These results combined with our statistical study suggest
that a non-repeating FRB may be the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of
prompt-collapse BNSs.

systems will produce a ground-space colour term that is dependent on water
absorption in the spectra of astronomical objects. This colour term can be used
to identify free-floating planets in star forming regions, mimicking a
successful ground-based technique that uses a filter sensitive to water
absorption. This paper shows that this colour term is an effective discriminant
between reddened background stars and ultracool dwarfs. This represents just
one science justification for a Galactic Plane survey in the event of an
extension to the Euclid mission beyond its original timeframe.

obtained recently by Isobe, Yuan, and Fu using the parquet renormalization

nesting around time-reversal symmetric points at a moderate doping of $\sim 2

binary neutron-star (NS) merger provided a unique view of off-axis GRBs and an
independent measurement of the NS merger rate. Comparing the observations of
GRB170817 with those of the regular population of short GRBs (sGRBs), we show
that an order unity fraction of NS mergers result in sGRB jets that breakout of
the surrounding ejecta. We argue that the luminosity function of sGRBs, peaking
at $\approx 2\times 10^{52}\, \mbox{erg s}^{-1}$, is likely an intrinsic
property of the sGRB central engine and that sGRB jets are typically narrow
with opening angles $\theta_0 \approx 0.1$. We perform Monte Carlo simulations
to examine models for the structure and efficiency of the prompt emission in
off axis sGRBs. We find that only a small fraction ($\sim 0.01-0.1$) of NS
mergers detectable by LIGO/VIRGO in GWs is expected to be also detected in
prompt $\gamma$-rays and that GW170817-like events are very rare. For a NS
merger rate of $\sim 1500$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, as inferred from GW170817, we
expect within the next decade up to $\sim 12$ joint detections with off-axis
GRBs for structured jet models and just $\sim 1$ for quasi-spherical cocoon
models where $\gamma$-rays are the result of shock breakout. Given several
joint detections and the rates of their discoveries, the different structure
models can be distinguished. In addition the existence of a cocoon with a
reservoir of thermal energy may be observed directly in the UV, given a
sufficiently rapid localisation of the GW source.

mass $M_{\rm ZAMS} \gtrsim 8M_\odot$ is exhausted, the central part of the iron
or magnesium core collapses and forms a neutron star or a black hole. At the
same time, the material above the collapsing core is rapidly ejected, leading
to a stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) explosion if the outer hydrogen
envelope of the star was removed before its explosion. The envelope is
presumably stripped either via strong stellar winds or due to mass transfer to
a companion star in a close binary orbit. It is not clear which process is
dominant, and whether different mechanisms are at work for different classes of
SESNe; type IIb, Ib, and Ic SNe in order of increasing degree of envelope
stripping. In this work, a new analysis of late-time nebular spectra of SESNe
is presented, which is more sensitive to differences in the core structure than
early-phase spectral analysis. The results show that the progenitors of SNe IIb
and Ib are indistinguishable except for the residual amount of hydrogen
envelope while the progenitors of SNe Ic are not only deficient in hydrogen and
helium, but are also distinctly more massive than SNe IIb and Ib. These
findings strongly suggest that more than one mechanism is responsible for the
removal of the outer hydrogen envelope and the deeper helium layer, with the
former most likely due to binary interaction, and the latter involving a
mass-dependent process such as strong stellar winds or episodic pre-explosion
mass ejection.

number of users synchronously place their requests from a content library, and
the performance is measured in terms of the latency in satisfying all of these
demands. In practice, however, users start watching an online video content
asynchronously over time, and often abort watching a video before it is
completed. The latter behaviour is captured by the notion of audience retention
rate, which measures the portion of a video content watched on average. In
order to bring coded caching one step closer to practice, asynchronous user
demands are considered in this paper, by allowing user demands to arrive
randomly over time, and both the popularity of video files, and the audience
retention rates are taken into account. A decentralized partial coded caching
(PCC) scheme is proposed, together with two cache allocation schemes; namely
the optimal cache allocation (OCA) and the popularity-based cache allocation
(PCA), which allocate users' caches among different chunks of the video files
in the library. Numerical results validate that the proposed PCC scheme, either
with OCA or PCA, outperforms conventional uncoded caching as well as the
state-of-the-art decentralized caching schemes, which consider only the file
popularities, and are designed for synchronous demand arrivals. An
information-theoretical lower bound on the average delivery rate is also

discovering strongly lensed quasars in the imaging data of the Dark Energy

and spectroscopy sufficient to construct accurate lens models. In this paper,
we first present forecasts for STRIDES. Then, we describe the STRIDES

Ostrovski et al.), STRIDES followed up 117 targets identifying 7 new strongly
lensed systems, and 7 nearly identical quasars (NIQs), which could be confirmed
as lenses by the detection of the lens galaxy. 76 candidates were rejected and
27 remain otherwise inconclusive, for a success rate in the range 6-35\%. This
rate is comparable to that of previous searches like SQLS even though the
parent dataset of STRIDES is purely photometric and our selection of candidates
cannot rely on spectroscopic information.

that they use different messaging strategies with partners of different

constellation of points to learn classification information from point cloud

to classify an individual high-dimensional observation, in a point-cloud
classification problem the goal is to classify a set of d-dimensional
observations. Because a point cloud is a set, there is no ordering to the
collection of points in a point-cloud classification problem. Thus, the
challenge of classifying point clouds inputs is in building a classifier which
is agnostic to the ordering of the observations, yet preserves the
d-dimensional information of each point in the set. This research presents
Ursa, a new layer type for an artificial neural network which achieves these
two properties. Similar to new methods for this task, this architecture works
directly on d-dimensional points rather than first converting the points to a
d-dimensional volume. The Ursa layer is followed by a series of dense layers to
classify 2D and 3D objects from point clouds. Experiments on ModelNet40 and
MNIST data show classification results comparable with current methods, while
reducing the training parameters by over 50 percent.

source technologies was deployed to support real-time, big data workloads. Data
acquisition workflows for Apache Storm and NiFi were developed in Java and
Python to capture patient monitoring and laboratory data for downstream
analytics. Results: The use of emerging data management approaches along with
open-source technologies such as Hadoop can be used to create integrated data
lakes to store large, real-time data sets. This infrastructure also provides a
robust analytics platform where healthcare and biomedical research data can be
analyzed in near real-time for precision medicine and computational healthcare
use cases. Discussion: The implementation and use of integrated data science
platforms offer organizations the opportunity to combine traditional data sets,
including data from the electronic health record, with emerging big data

noise in relaxation oscillators by showing the microscopic origins of the noise
and explains temperature dependency. The noise arises from fluctuation of the
energy accompanying the excess carriers on device (transistors) capacitors in
the oscillator. Such fluctuation has its physical origin from the noise of such
carriers, which, microscopically, are distributed across the energy levels
(Fermi-Dirac). Furthermore this energy can be interpreted, circuit-wise, such
that its gradient, with respect to circuit state variables, correspond to time
evolution of current and voltage i.e. the oscillator dynamics. Three methods:
potential energy based (macroscopic), free energy based (microscopic), Langevin
equation based, are used to develop the noise model. The model temperature
variation over range of 77K-300K was compared to measured results on
oscillators fabricated in 0.13 {\mu}m CMOS technology. The trend agree
reasonably well, where above a crossover temperature, the phase noise is a
monotonic increasing function of temperature, while below the crossover
temperature, the phase noise stays relatively constant and an explanation based
on Langevin equation, extended to quantum regime, is offered.

Universe, and gravitationally lensed SMGs provide bright continuum sources
suitable for absorption line studies. Abundances of OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$ are
useful for inferring $\zeta_{\rm H}$ when combined with chemical models, and
have been used for this purpose within the Milky Way. At redshifts $z\gtrsim2$
transitions out of the ground rotational states of OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$ are

we propose a novel hand Gesture Generative Adversarial Network (GestureGAN).
GestureGAN consists of a single generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$, which
takes as input a conditional hand image and a target hand skeleton image.
GestureGAN utilizes the hand skeleton information explicitly, and learns the
gesture-to-gesture mapping through two novel losses, the color loss and the
cycle-consistency loss. The proposed color loss handles the issue of ""channel

the proposed GestureGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
unconstrained hand gesture-to-gesture translation task. Meanwhile, the
generated images are in high-quality and are photo-realistic, allowing them to
be used as data augmentation to improve the performance of a hand gesture

there has been substantial effort in designing complex algorithms with the goal
of improving worst-case approximation ratios. Our goal is to determine how
these algorithms perform on more practical instances rather than worst-case
instances. In particular, we are interested in whether the ranking of the
algorithms by their worst-case performance is consistent with the ranking of
the algorithms by their average-case/practical performance. We are also
interested in whether preprocessing times and implementation difficulties that
are introduced by these algorithms are justified in practice. To that end we
evaluate these algorithms on different random inputs as well as real-life
instances obtained from publicly available repositories. We compare these
algorithms against several simple greedy-style algorithms. Most of the complex
algorithms in the literature are presented as being non-greedy (i.e., an
algorithm can intentionally skip matching a node that has available neighbors)
to simplify the analysis. Every such algorithm can be turned into a greedy one
without hurting its worst-case performance. On our benchmarks, non-greedy
versions of these algorithms perform much worse than their greedy versions.
Greedy versions perform about as well as the simplest greedy algorithm by
itself. This, together with our other findings, suggests that simplest greedy
algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art worst-case algorithms for

declarative paradigms: constraint solving and logic programming. Concurrent
Constraint Programming (CCP) is a declarative model for concurrency where
agents interact by telling and asking constraints in a shared store. In a
previous paper, we developed a framework for dynamic slicing of CCP where the
user first identifies that a (partial) computation is wrong. Then, she marks
(selects) some parts of the final state corresponding to the data (constraints)
and processes that she wants to study more deeply. An automatic process of
slicing begins, and the partial computation is ""depurated"" by removing
irrelevant information. In this paper we give two major contributions. First,
we extend the framework to CLP, thus generalizing the previous work. Second, we
provide an assertion language suitable for both, CCP and CLP, which allows the
user to specify some properties of the computations in her program. If a state
in a computation does not satisfy an assertion then some ""wrong"" information is
identified and an automatic slicing process can start. This way we make one
step further towards automatizing the slicing process. We show that our
framework can be integrated with the previous semi-automatic one, giving the
user more choices and flexibility. We show by means of examples and experiments
the usefulness of our approach.

the Sun's polar magnetic fields during a solar cycle minimum is the best
predictor of the amplitude of the next solar cycle. Surface flux transport
models can be used to extend these predictions by evolving the Sun's surface
magnetic field to obtain an earlier prediction for the strength of the polar
fields, and thus the amplitude of the next cycle. In 2016, our Advective Flux
Transport (AFT) model was used to do this, producing an early prediction for
Solar Cycle 25. At that time, AFT predicted that Cycle 25 will be similar in
strength to the Cycle 24, with an uncertainty of about 15% . AFT also predicted
that the polar fields in the southern hemisphere would weaken in late 2016 and
into 2017 before recovering. That AFT prediction was based on the magnetic
field configuration at the end of January 2016. We now have 2 more years of
observations. We examine the accuracy of the 2016 AFT prediction and find that
the new observations track well with AFT's predictions for the last two years.
We show that the southern relapse did in fact occur, though the timing was off
by several months. We propose a possible cause for the southern relapse and
discuss the reason for the offset in timing. Finally, we provide an updated AFT
prediction for Solar Cycle 25 which includes solar observations through January
of 2018.

for new physics in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector. The first part of
the study is model-independent, with $h$ couplings to standard model particles
scaled by quantities that are taken to be free parameters. At the same time,
the additional loop contributions to $h \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and $h
\rightarrow Z\gamma$, mediated by charged scalar contributions in the extended
scalar sector, are treated in terms of gauge-invariant effective operators.
Having justified this approach for cases where the concerned scalar masses are
a little above the $Z$-boson mass, we fit the existing data to obtain
marginalized 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ regions in the space of the coefficients
of such effective operators, where the limit on the $h \rightarrow Z\gamma$
branching ratio is used as a constraint. The correlation between, say, the
gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion channels, as reflected in a non-diagonal
covariance matrix, is taken into account. After thus obtaining
model-independent fits, the allowed values of the coefficients are translated
into permissible regions of the parameter spaces of several specific models. In
this spirit we constrain four different types of two Higgs doublet models, and
also models with one or two $Y = 2$ scalar triplets, taking into account the
correlatedness of the scale factors in $h$-interactions and the various
couplings of charged Higgs states in each extended scenario.

(FG%) - the number of makes out of the total number of shots. Even more
advanced metrics like true shooting percentage are calculated by counting each
player's 2-point, 3-point, and free throw makes and misses, ignoring the
spatiotemporal data now available (Kubatko et al. 2007). In this paper we aim
to better characterize player shooting skill by introducing a new estimator
based on post-shot release shot-make probabilities. Via the Rao-Blackwell
theorem, we propose a shot-make probability model that conditions probability
estimates on shot trajectory information, thereby reducing the variance of the
new estimator relative to standard FG%. We obtain shooting information by using
optical tracking data to estimate three factors for each shot: entry angle,
shot depth, and left-right accuracy. Next we use these factors to model
shot-make probabilities for all shots in the 2014-15 season, and use these
probabilities to produce a Rao-Blackwellized FG% estimator (RB-FG%) for each
player. We demonstrate that RB-FG% is better than raw FG% at predicting 3-point
shooting and true-shooting percentages. Overall, we find that conditioning
shot-make probabilities on spatial trajectory information stabilizes inference
of FG%, creating the potential to estimate shooting statistics earlier in a
season than was previously possible.

recurrent networks that addresses both these issues. In our model, neurons
perform leaky integration and synaptic weights are updated through a local

The proposed solution combines Multi-Armed Bandit learning with a lightweight

two scenarios: an unknown fixed number of users, and a dynamic number of users.
Analytic performance guarantees, proving convergence to stable marriage

storing compressed time series. Plato's key novelty is the delivery of tight
deterministic error guarantees for time series analytics. Plato evaluates any
time series expression composed by the linear algebra operators over vectors,
along with arithmetic operators. This large scope of possible expressions
includes common use cases such as correlation and cross-correlation
expressions. Each time series is segmented either by fixed-length segmentation
or by (a usually more effective) variable-length segmentation. Each segment is
compressed by an estimation/compression function that approximates the actual
values and is coming from a user-chosen function family, as taught by many
prior works. The novelty is that Plato associates to each segment 1 to 3
(depending on the case) precomputed error measures and, using them, Plato
computes tight deterministic error guarantees for analytics over the
compressions. Importantly, some compression families lead to much better
deterministic error guarantees. This work identifies two broad estimation
function family groups (Vector Space (VS) and Linear Scalable Family (LSF)),
which lead to theoretically and practically high-quality guarantees, even for
expressions (eg correlation) that combine multiple time series that have been
independently compressed and may, thus, use misaligned segmentations. The
theoretical aspect of ""high quality"" is crisply captured by the Amplitude
Independence (AI) property: An AI guarantee does not depend on the amplitude of
the involved time series, even when we combine multiple time series. The
experiments on four real-life datasets showed that when the novel AI guarantees
were applicable, the approximate query results were certified to be very close

  We investigate how the platform can estimate the dependence of the observable

This paper treats a network snapshot as a graph signal, and develops effective
approaches for infection analysis based on graph signal processing. For the
macro (network-level) analysis aiming to distinguish an epidemic from random

and 3) a machine learning-based framework is designed employing either the GFT

DBGWs also enable the micro (node-level) infection analysis, through which the
performance of epidemic countermeasures can be improved. Extensive simulations
are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the proposed algorithms

problems. In the classical model, each player selects a path connecting her
source and target vertices. The cost of traversing an edge depends on the {\em
load}; namely, number of players that traverse it. Thus, it abstracts the fact
that different users may use a resource at different times and for different
durations, which plays an important role in determining the costs of the users
in reality. For example, when transmitting packets in a communication network,
routing traffic in a road network, or processing a task in a production system,
actual sharing and congestion of resources crucially depends on time.
  In \cite{AGK17}, we introduced {\em timed network games}, which add a time
component to network games. Each vertex $v$ in the network is associated with a
cost function, mapping the load on $v$ to the price that a player pays for
staying in $v$ for one time unit with this load. Each edge in the network is
guarded by the time intervals in which it can be traversed, which forces the
players to spend time in the vertices. In this work we significantly extend the
way time can be referred to in timed network games. In the model we study, the
network is equipped with {\em clocks}, and, as in timed automata, edges are
guarded by constraints on the values of the clocks, and their traversal may
involve a reset of some clocks. We argue that the stronger model captures many
realistic networks. The addition of clocks breaks the techniques we developed
in \cite{AGK17} and we develop new techniques in order to show that positive
results on classic network games carry over to the stronger timed setting.

energetic explosions discovered in untargeted transient surveys in the past
decade. The progenitor stars and the physical mechanism behind their large
radiated energies ($\sim10^{51}$ erg) are both debated, with one class of
models primarily requiring a large rotational energy, while the other requires
very massive progenitors to either convert kinetic energy into radiation via
interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), or engender a pair-instability
explosion. Observing the structure of the CSM around SLSN-I offers a powerful
test of some scenarios, though direct observations are scarce. Here, we present
a series of spectroscopic observations of the SLSN-I iPTF16eh, which reveal
both absorption and time- and frequency-variable emission in the Mg II
resonance doublet. We show that these observations are naturally explained as a
resonance scattering light echo from a circumstellar shell. Modeling the
evolution of the emission, we find a shell radius of 0.1 pc and velocity of
3300 km s$^{-1}$, implying the shell was ejected three decades prior to the
supernova explosion. These properties match theoretical predictions of
pulsational pair-instability shell ejections, and imply the progenitor had a He
core mass of $\sim 50-55~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, corresponding to an initial mass of
$\sim 115~{\rm M}_{\odot}$.

initiate the study of ""operator spreading"" in quantum maps on a torus, systems
which do not have a tensor-product Hilbert space or a notion of spatial
locality. Using the perturbed Arnold cat map as an example, we analytically
compare and contrast the evolutions of functions on classical phase space and
quantum operator evolutions, and identify distinct timescales that characterize
the dynamics of operators in quantum chaotic maps. Until an Ehrenfest time, the
quantum system exhibits classical chaos, i.e. it mimics the behavior of the
corresponding classical system. After an operator scrambling time, the operator
looks ""random"" in the initial basis, a characteristic feature of quantum chaos.
These timescales can be related to the quasi-energy spectrum of the unitary via
the spectral form factor. Furthermore, we show examples of ""emergent
classicality"" in quantum problems far away from the classical limit. Finally,
we study operator evolution in non-chaotic and mixed quantum maps using the
Chirikov standard map as an example.

discovered Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters have extremely high oxygen line
ratios: O32>4. Here we aim to understand the properties and the occurrences of
galaxies with such high line ratios. Combining data from several MUSE GTO
programmes, we select a population of star-forming galaxies with bright
emission lines, from which we draw 406 galaxies for our analysis based on their
position in the z-dependent star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass (M*)
plane. Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on
their O32 ratios (3.7%) and 104 galaxies have O32>1 (26%). Our analysis shows
no significant correlation between M*, SFR, and the distance from the SFR-M*
relation with O32. We find a decrease in the fraction of galaxies with O32>1
with increasing M*, however, this is most likely a result of the relationship
between O32 and metallicity, rather than between O32 and M*. We draw a
comparison sample of local analogues with <z>~0.03 from SDSS, and find similar
incidence rates for this sample. In order to investigate the evolution in the
fraction of high O32 emitters with redshift, we bin the sample into three
redshift subsamples of equal number, but find no evidence for a dependence on
redshift. Furthermore, we compare the observed line ratios with those predicted
by nebular models with no LyC escape and find that most of the extreme oxygen
emitters can be reproduced by low metallicity models. The remaining galaxies
are likely LyC emitter candidates. Finally, based on a comparison between
electron temperature estimates from the [OIII4363]/[OIII]5007 ratio of the
extreme oxygen emitters and nebular models, we argue that the galaxies with the
most extreme O32 ratios have young light-weighted ages.

between stellar mass ($M_{*}$) and star formation rate (SFR), dubbed the `star
formation sequence'. A turnover in the sequence has been observed, where
galaxies with $M_{*} < 10^{10} {\rm M}_{\odot}$ follow a steeper relation than
their higher mass counterparts, suggesting that the low-mass slope is (nearly)
linear. In this paper, we characterise the properties of the low-mass end of
the star formation sequence between $7 \leq \log M_{*}[{\rm M}_{\odot}] \leq
10.5$ at redshift $0.11 < z < 0.91$. We use the deepest MUSE observations of
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and the Hubble Deep Field South to construct a
sample of 179 star-forming galaxies with high signal-to-noise emission lines.
Dust-corrected SFRs are determined from H$\beta$ $\lambda 4861$ and H$\alpha$
$\lambda 6563$. We model the star formation sequence with a Gaussian
distribution around a hyperplane between $\log M_{*}$, $\log {\rm SFR}$, and
$\log (1+z)$, to simultaneously constrain the slope, redshift evolution, and
intrinsic scatter. We find a sub-linear slope for the low-mass regime where
$\log {\rm SFR}[{\rm M}_{\odot}/{\rm yr}] = 0.83^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \log
M_{*}[{\rm M}_{\odot}] + 1.74^{+0.66}_{-0.68} \log (1+z)$, increasing with
redshift. We recover an intrinsic scatter in the relation of $\sigma_{\rm intr}
= 0.44^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ dex, larger than typically found at higher masses. As
both hydrodynamical simulations and (semi-)analytical models typically favour a
steeper slope in the low-mass regime, our results provide new constraints on
the feedback processes which operate preferentially in low-mass halos.

found that in some regions of the parameter space, the DM would be difficult to
observe in direct detection experiments while easier to observe in indirect

help pinpoint the details of the Hidden Gauged SU(3) model. Important to this,
is that even for moderate changes in input parameter values, the relative relic
density of each species can change significantly resulting in large changes in

spectrum to increase the available capacity. Communication at such high
frequencies, however, suffers from high path loss and blockage, therefore
directional transmissions using antenna arrays and dense deployments are
needed. Thus, when evaluating the performance of mmWave mobile networks, it is
necessary to accurately model the complex channel, the directionality of the
transmission, but also the interplay that these elements can have with the
whole protocol stack, both in the radio access and in the higher layers. In
this paper, we improve the channel model abstraction of the mmWave module for
ns-3, by introducing the support of a more realistic antenna array model,
compliant with 3GPP NR requirements, and of multiple antenna arrays at the base
stations and mobile handsets. We then study the end-to-end performance of a
mmWave cellular network by varying the channel and antenna array
configurations, and show that increasing the number of antenna arrays and,
consequently, the number of sectors is beneficial for both throughput and
latency.

  for Categorical Unmeasured Confounding",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmeasured confounding is a threat to causal inference in observational
studies. In recent years, use of negative controls to mitigate unmeasured
confounding has gained increasing recognition and popularity. Negative controls
have a longstanding tradition in laboratory sciences and epidemiology to rule
out non-causal explanations, although they have been used primarily for bias
detection. Recently, Miao et al. (2018) have described sufficient conditions
under which a pair of negative control exposure and outcome variables can be
used to nonparametrically identify the average treatment effect (ATE) from
observational data subject to uncontrolled confounding. In this paper, we
establish nonparametric identification of the ATE under weaker conditions in
the case of categorical unmeasured confounding and negative control variables.
We also provide a general semiparametric framework for obtaining inferences
about the ATE while leveraging information about a possibly large number of
measured covariates. In particular, we derive the semiparametric efficiency
bound in the nonparametric model, and we propose multiply robust and locally
efficient estimators when nonparametric estimation may not be feasible. We
assess the finite sample performance of our methods in extensive simulation
studies. Finally, we illustrate our methods with an application to the
postlicensure surveillance of vaccine safety among children.

forces when they are illuminated by light. In general, two kinds of forces are
commonly assumed: binding forces that make them attract/repel each other and
scattering forces that push the system forwards. Tangential forces and orbital
torques can also be induced to align the dimer with the electric field. In this
work, new degrees of freedom are found for a dimer of silica nanospheres under
illumination with linearly-polarized plane waves. The results have a general
validity for arbitrary mesoscale systems: multiple scattering of light induces
unexpected torques and unbalanced forces. These torques include spin
contributions to the movement of the whole system.
  The results are supported by previous works and pave the way for the
engineering of nanoscale devices and nanorotators. Any application which is

helping radiologists to evaluate digital mammography (DM) exams. DM exams are
generated by devices from different vendors, with diverse characteristics
between and even within vendors. Physical properties of these devices and
postprocessing of the images can greatly influence the resulting mammogram.
This results in the fact that a deep learning model trained on data from one
vendor cannot readily be applied to data from another vendor. This paper
investigates the use of tailored transfer learning methods based on adversarial
learning to tackle this problem. We consider a database of DM exams (mostly
bilateral and two views) generated by Hologic and Siemens vendors. We analyze
two transfer learning settings: 1) unsupervised transfer, where Hologic data
with soft lesion annotation at pixel level and Siemens unlabelled data are used
to annotate images in the latter data; 2) weak supervised transfer, where exam
level labels for images from the Siemens mammograph are available. We propose
tailored variants of recent state-of-the-art methods for transfer learning
which take into account the class imbalance and incorporate knowledge provided
by the annotations at exam level. Results of experiments indicate the
beneficial effect of transfer learning in both transfer settings. Notably, at
0.02 false positives per image, we achieve a sensitivity of 0.37, compared to
0.30 of a baseline with no transfer. Results indicate that using exam level
annotations gives an additional increase in sensitivity.

strategy and an automatic method of collecting and labeling data. Our
auto-tuning framework has the following advantages that make it suitable for
tuning an autonomous driving motion planner. First, compared to that of most
inverse reinforcement learning algorithms, our algorithm training is efficient
and capable of being applied to different scenarios. Second, the offline
training strategy offers a safe way to adjust the parameters before public road
testing. Third, the expert driving data and information about the surrounding
environment are collected and automatically labeled, which considerably reduces
the manual effort. Finally, the motion planner tuned by the framework is
examined via both simulation and public road testing and is shown to achieve
good performance.

Markov state models of nonequilibrium biochemical networks that support
oscillations. We obtain analytical expressions for the coherence and period of

details of the transition rates in the Markov state model. However, our
analytical calculations reveal that driving the system out of equilibrium makes
many of these details - specifically, the location and arrangement of the
transition rates - irrelevant to the coherence and period of oscillations. This
theoretical prediction is confirmed by excellent agreement with numerical
results. As a consequence, the coherence and period of oscillations can be
robustly maintained in the presence of fluctuations in the irrelevant

improves the coherence of oscillations, our findings suggest that it plays the
additional role of making the coherence and the average period of oscillations
robust to fluctuations in rates that can result from the noisy environment of

information from both questions and passages to predict corresponding answers.
However, despite intense interest in the topic, with hundreds of published
papers vying for leaderboard dominance, basic questions about the difficulty of
many popular benchmarks remain unanswered. In this paper, we establish sensible
baselines for the bAbI, SQuAD, CBT, CNN, and Who-did-What datasets, finding
that question- and passage-only models often perform surprisingly well. On $14$
out of $20$ bAbI tasks, passage-only models achieve greater than $50\%$
accuracy, sometimes matching the full model. Interestingly, while CBT provides
$20$-sentence stories only the last is needed for comparably accurate

different resolution, extracted at different stages of the network. The
algorithm is 2.5D which means that the input is a set of consecutive scan

upon the underlying constitutive material model. Commonly used linear or
nonlinear constitutive material models only cover a tiny part of possible
material behavior. In this work we propose a unified framework for modeling
deformable material. The key idea is to use a neural network to correct a
nominal model of the elastic and damping properties of the object. The neural
network encapsulates a complex function that is hard to explicitly model. It
injects force corrections that help the forward simulation to more accurately
predict the true behavior of a given soft object, which includes non-linear
elastic forces and damping. Attempting to satisfy the requirement from real
material interference and animation design scenarios, we learn material models
from examples of dynamic behavior of a deformable object's surface. The
challenge is that such data is sparse as it is consistently given only on part
of the surface. Sparse reduced space-time optimization is employed to gradually
generate increasingly accurate training data, which further refines and
enhances the neural network. We evaluate our choice of network architecture and
show evidence that the modest amount of training data we use is suitable for
the problem tackled. Our method is demonstrated with a set of synthetic

a new line of research on sublinear-time solution techniques for UQ
applications of the type above which will eventually be able to scale to
significantly higher-dimensional problems than what are currently
computationally feasible.
  More concretely, let $B$ be a finite Bounded Orthonormal Product Basis (BOPB)

$f$ that is sparse in the BOPB, that is, $f:\mathcal{D}\subset R^D\rightarrow

flare, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave and fast coronal mass ejection (CME). We
investigate the particle release by comparing the release times of particles at
the spacecraft and the times when magnetic connectivity between the source and
the spacecraft was established. The EUV wave propagating to the magnetic
footpoint of the spacecraft in the lower corona and the shock expanding to the
open field line connecting the spacecraft in the upper corona are thought to be
responsible for the particle release. We track the evolution of the EUV wave
and model the propagation of the shock using EUV and white-light observations.
No obvious evidence indicates that the EUV wave reached the magnetic footpoint
of either STEREO A or L1-observers. Our shock modeling shows that the release
time of the particles observed at L1 was consistent with the time when the
shock first established contact with the magnetic field line connecting
L1-observers. The release of the particles observed by STEREO A was delayed
relative to the time when the shock was initially connected to STEREO A via the
magnetic field line. We suggest that the particle acceleration efficiency of
the portion of the shock connected to the spacecraft determines the release of
energetic particles at the spacecraft.

phases induced by antenna displacements in a sensor array are unique, which
makes array configuration feasible for symbol embedding. We also exploit the
fact that in a MIMO radar system, the association of independent waveforms with
the transmit antennas can change over different pulse repetition periods
without impacting the radar functionality. We show that by reconfiguring sparse

  Causal Effects","Supplement and Sample Codes are included",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmeasured confounding is a key challenge for causal inference. Negative
control variables are widely available in observational studies. A negative
control outcome is associated with the confounder but not causally affected by
the exposure in view, and a negative control exposure is correlated with the
primary exposure or the confounder but does not causally affect the outcome of
interest. In this paper, we establish a framework to use them for unmeasured
confounding adjustment. We introduce a confounding bridge function that links
the potential outcome mean and the negative control outcome distribution, and
we incorporate a negative control exposure to identify the bridge function and
the average causal effect. Our approach can be used to repair an invalid
instrumental variable in case it is correlated with the unmeasured confounder.
We also extend our approach by allowing for a causal association between the
primary exposure and the control outcome. We illustrate our approach with
simulations and apply it to a study about the short-term effect of air
pollution. Although a standard analysis shows a significant acute effect of
PM2.5 on mortality, our analysis indicates that this effect may be confounded,
and after double negative control adjustment, the effect is attenuated toward
zero.

projects users and items into some shared low-dimensional latent feature space,

objectives that reward semantics and structure. The {\it generator} is a
sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates the {\it structure} and {\it

the passage that the question can pivot on. Employing the copy and coverage
mechanisms, it also acknowledges other contextually important (and possibly
rare) keywords in the passage that the question needs to conform to, while not
redundantly repeating words. The {\it evaluator} model evaluates and assigns a
reward to each predicted question based on its conformity to the {\it
structure} of ground-truth questions. We propose two novel QG-specific reward
functions for text conformity and answer conformity of the generated question.
The evaluator also employs structure-sensitive rewards based on evaluation
measures such as BLEU, GLEU, and ROUGE-L, which are suitable for QG. In
contrast, most of the previous works only optimize the cross-entropy loss,
which can induce inconsistencies between training (objective) and testing

neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines.
A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a
high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the
high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the
readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and
classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to
other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training
cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is
amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems,
substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has
attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of
this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir
computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We

numerically investigated for planar or isotropic spins, and for cases of one or

the competition between exchange interactions of spins of the first two range
orders in one direction (in both directions) of a square lattice. The main
result is that the critical and temperature behavior is primarily determined by
topological defects that are present in all cases. In the case of planar spins,
vortices, fractional vortices and domain walls are present in the system. Their
interaction leads to the appearance of the phase of a chiral spin liquid, or
induces a single first-order transition, and in the vicinity of the Lifshitz
point vortices lead to a reentrant phase transition to the phase with a
collinear quasi-long-range order. When transitions in the chiral and continuous
order parameters are separated in temperature, they are of the 2D Ising and
Kosterlitz-Thouless types correspondingly. In the case of isotropic spins,
so-called $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices are present. They do not lead to the
appearance of a phase with long-range or quasi-long-range order in the case of
one chiral order parameter. However, their interaction leads to a sharp change
in the temperature dependence of the correlation length (crossover). In the
case of two chiral parameters, there are long-range chiral order of the Ising
type (chiral spin liquid) and domain walls. However, as a result of the
interaction of vortices and walls, the crossover and chiral transition occur at
the same temperature as a first-order transition.

according to the scale through a channel activation matrix and experimentally
show that SAN reduces the feature differences in the scale space. We evaluate
our method on VOC PASCAL and MS COCO dataset. We demonstrate SAN by conducting

what kind of features are used to discriminate the identities of face images

a novel face recognition method, called a pairwise relational network (PRN),
that obtains local appearance patches around landmark points on the feature
map, and captures the pairwise relation between a pair of local appearance
patches. The PRN is trained to capture unique and discriminative pairwise
relations among different identities. Because the existence and meaning of
pairwise relations should be identity dependent, we add a face identity state
feature, which obtains from the long short-term memory (LSTM) units network
with the sequential local appearance patches on the feature maps, to the PRN.
To further improve accuracy of face recognition, we combined the global
appearance representation with the pairwise relational feature. Experimental
results on the LFW show that the PRN using only pairwise relations achieved
99.65% accuracy and the PRN using both pairwise relations and face identity
state feature achieved 99.76% accuracy. On the YTF, both the PRN using only

cosmology, with the upcoming Euclid and LSST surveys, very tight constraints
are put on the expected performance of photometric redshift estimation using
broadband photometry, thus new methods have to be developed in order to reach
the required performance. We present a novel automatic method of optimizing
photometric redshift performance, the classification-aided photometric redshift
estimation (CPz). The main feature of CPz is the unified treatment of all
classes of objects detected in extragalactic surveys: galaxies of any type
(passive, starforming and starbursts), active galactic nuclei (AGN),
quasi-stellar objects (QSO), stars and also includes the identification of
potential photometric redshift catastrophic outliers. The method operates in
three stages. First, the photometric catalog is confronted with star, galaxy
and QSO model templates by means of spectral energy distribution fitting.
Second, three machine-learning classifiers are used to identify 1) the
probability of each source to be a star, 2) the optimal photometric redshift
model library set-up for each source and 3) the probability to be a photometric
redshift catastrophic outlier. Lastly, the final sample is assembled by
identifying the probability thresholds to be applied on the outcome of each of
the three classifiers. We apply our method to the near-infrared VISTA public
surveys, matched with optical photometry from CFHTLS, KIDS and SDSS,
mid-infrared WISE photometry. We show that CPz offers improved photometric
redshift performance for both normal galaxies and AGN without the need for

six-dimensional supergravity admitting null Killing vector $k^\mu$ trivially
lifted to type IIB supergravity by the addition of four-torus directions. The
torus directions provide covariantly constant spacelike vectors $l^\mu$. We
show that the original solution can be deformed as $g_{\mu \nu} \to g_{\mu \nu}

evolution of the pump and displays narrowing and Floquet-like sidebands at the
pump maximum, whereas the photoelectron spectra are also strongly affected by
the nonequilibrium occupation of the single-particle states due to the
excitation from the pump. The nonequilibrium Raman cross section is derived,
and the nonresonant one in both the $A_{1\mathrm{g}}$ and $B_{1\mathrm{g}}$

attributed to an interference effect or Brillouin scattering off the time
variations of the stress tensor. Both the ""measured"" occupation of

strongly modified by the probe-pulse width, which must be included in the

a major challenge in the field of parameter identification. We propose a
stepwise approach consisting in subdividing the frequency spectrum such that
the solution to a low-frequency subproblem serves as the starting point for the
immediately higher frequency range. In the current work, two different
inversion frameworks are used. The first approach is a gradient-based
deterministic procedure that seeks the model parameters by minimising a cost
function in the least squares sense and the second approach is a Bayesian
inversion framework. The latter provides a potential way to assess the validity
of the least squares estimate. In addition, it presents several advantages by
providing invaluable information on the uncertainty and correlation between the
estimated parameters. The methodology is illustrated on synthetic measurements
with known design variables and controlled noise levels. The model problem is
deliberately kept simple to allow for extensive numerical experiments to be
conducted in order to investigate the nature of the local minima in full
spectrum analyses and to assess the potential of the proposed method to
overcome these. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed methods may
present an efficient approach to find material parameters and their uncertainty
estimates with acceptable accuracy.

assuming that the exciting electron beams travel along overdense fibers or by
radio propagation effects that may cause a source to appear at a larger height

the range 230--300 nm, measured by the SCIAMACHY ultra-violet (UV) channel 1.
The retrieval is adapted from the mesosphere and lower thermosphere mode (MLT,

  Since the nominal mode limb scans extend only to about 91 km, we use NO

models, as a priori input. The priors are the Nitric Oxide Empirical Model
(NOEM; Marsh et al., 2004) and a regression model derived from the MLT NO data
comparison (Bender et al., 2015). Our algorithm yields plausible NO number
densities from 60 to 85 km from the SCIAMACHY nominal limb mode scans. Using a
priori input substantially reduces the incorrect attribution of NO from the
lower thermosphere, where no direct limb measurements are available. The
vertical resolution lies between 5 and 10 km in the altitude range 65--80 km.
  Analysing all SCIAMACHY nominal limb scans provides almost 10 years (from
August 2002 to April 2012) of daily NO measurements in this altitude range.
This provides a unique data record of NO in the upper atmosphere and is
invaluable for constraining NO in the mesosphere, in particular for testing and
validating chemistry climate models during this period.

applications in social network analysis (e.g., estimating the clustering

complexity of subgraph counting has been studied extensively in the literature,
but many natural settings are still not well understood. In this paper we
revisit the subgraph (and hypergraph) counting problem in the sketching model,
where the algorithm's state as it processes a stream of updates to the graph is
a linear function of the stream. This model has recently received a lot of
attention in the literature, and has become a standard model for solving
dynamic graph streaming problems.
  In this paper we give a tight bound on the sketching complexity of counting
the number of occurrences of a small subgraph $H$ in a bounded degree graph $G$
presented as a stream of edge updates. Specifically, we show that the space
complexity of the problem is governed by the fractional vertex cover number of
the graph $H$. Our subgraph counting algorithm implements a natural vertex
sampling approach, with sampling probabilities governed by the vertex cover of
$H$. Our main technical contribution lies in a new set of Fourier analytic
tools that we develop to analyze multiplayer communication protocols in the
simultaneous communication model, allowing us to prove a tight lower bound. We
believe that our techniques are likely to find applications in other settings.
Besides giving tight bounds for all graphs $H$, both our algorithm and lower
bounds extend to the hypergraph setting, albeit with some loss in space
complexity.

classical models such as accretion history and magnetic activity are not
preferred to explain the mass discrepancy. We also discuss the performance of
the evolutionary model by compiling similar low-mass objects in evolutionary

However, due to the deficiencies of the reprojection loss, the network needs to

reprojection loss, which resolves the issues of the original reprojection loss.
With this new loss function, the network can be trained without careful

a Riemannian metric, the Weyl-type curvature tensor reduces to the classic
projective Weyl tensor. In the general case, the Weyl-type curvature tensor
differs from the Weyl projective curvature, it is not a projective invariant,
and hence Beltrami Theorem does not work in Finsler geometry. We provide the
relation between the Weyl-type curvature tensors of two projectively related

context of human balance control, the response delay is traditionally modeled
using the formalism of delay-differential equations, which adopts the
approximation of fixed delay. However, experimental studies revealing
substantial variability, adaptive anticipation, and non-stationary dynamics of
response delay provide evidence against this approximation. In this paper, we
call for development of principally new mathematical formalism describing human
response delay. To support this, we present the experimental data from a simple
virtual stick balancing task. Our results demonstrate that human response delay
is a widely distributed random variable with complex properties, which can
exhibit oscillatory and adaptive dynamics characterized by long-range
correlations. Given this, we argue that the fixed-delay approximation ignores
essential properties of human response, and conclude with possible directions
for future developments of new mathematical notions describing human control.

$S_0$ and $\eta$ first in the bursting limit (where the ratio $\gamma$ of the

be done almost entirely analytically, and the results are in good agreement

required. However, $S_0$ can be calculated analytically to first order in
$1/\gamma$, and the result agrees well with the full numerical calculation for

we can account qualitatively for the way the prefactor $\eta$ varies with

comprised of several multi-antenna remote radio units (RUs) which compress the
signals that they receive from multiple mobile users (MUs) and forward them to
a CU via wireless fronthaul links. To enable reliable high rate fronthaul
links, we employ a hybrid radio frequency (RF)/free space optical (FSO) system
for fronthauling. To strike a balance between complexity and performance, we
consider three different quantization schemes at the RUs, namely per-antenna
vector quantization (AVQ), per-RU vector quantization (RVQ), and distributed
source coding (DSC), and two different receivers at the CU, namely the linear
minimum mean square error receiver and the optimal successive interference
cancellation receiver. For this network architecture, we investigate the joint
optimization of the quantization noise covariance matrices at the RUs and the
RF time allocation to the multiple-access and fronthaul links for rate region
maximization. To this end, we formulate a unified weighted sum rate
maximization problem valid for each possible pair of the considered
quantization and detection schemes. To handle the non-convexity of the unified
problem, we transform it into a bi-convex problem which facilitates the
derivation of an efficient suboptimal solution using alternating convex
optimization and golden section search. Our simulation results show that for
each pair of the considered quantization and detection schemes, C-RAN with
hybrid RF/FSO fronthauling can achieve a considerable sum rate gain compared to
conventional systems employing pure FSO fronthauling, especially under
unfavorable atmospheric conditions. Moreover, employing a more sophisticated
quantization scheme can significantly improve the system performance under
adverse atmospheric conditions.

converting an ensemble score into piano scores, that can control performance
difficulty. While previous studies have focused on describing the condition for
playable piano scores, it depends on player's skill and can change continuously
with the tempo. We thus computationally quantify performance difficulty as well
as musical fidelity to the original score, and formulate the problem as
optimization of musical fidelity under constraints on difficulty values. First,
performance difficulty measures are developed by means of probabilistic
generative models for piano scores and the relation to the rate of performance
errors is studied. Second, to describe musical fidelity, we construct a
probabilistic model integrating a prior piano-score model and a model
representing how ensemble scores are likely to be edited. An iterative
optimization algorithm for piano reduction is developed based on statistical
inference of the model. We confirm the effect of the iterative procedure; we
find that subjective difficulty and musical fidelity monotonically increase
with controlled difficulty values; and we show that incorporating sequential
dependence of pitches and fingering motion in the piano-score model improves
the quality of reduction scores in high-difficulty cases.

the instrument calibrations using zero polarization and high polarization
standard stars and here we give a recipe for the absolute calibration of

polarimetric beam shifts, which can be explained as Goos-H\""ahnchen shifts from

provides a framework for analysing invariant measures of these two types of

these chains. Then we study their uniqueness and ergodicity assuming that $Y$

fading channels can be impacted by shadowing. A family of shadowed
$\kappa$-$\mu$ fading models are introduced and classified according to whether
the underlying $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading undergoes single or double shadowing. We
discuss three types of single shadowed $\kappa$-$\mu$ model (denoted Type I to
Type III) and three types of double shadowed $\kappa$-$\mu$ model (denoted Type
I to Type III). The taxonomy of the single shadowed Type I - III models is
dependent upon whether the fading model assumes that the dominant component,
the scattered waves, or both experience shadowing. The categorization of the
double shadowed Type I - III models is dependent upon whether a) the envelope
experiences shadowing of the dominant component, which is preceded (or
succeeded) by a secondary round of shadowing (multiplicative), or b) the
dominant and scattered contributions are fluctuated by two independent
shadowing processes, or c) the scattered waves of the envelope are subject to
shadowing, which is also preceded (or succeeded) by a secondary round of
multiplicative shadowing. Although the physical definition of the examined
models make no predetermination of the statistics of the shadowing process, for
illustrative purposes, two example cases are provided for each type of single
and double shadowed model by assuming that the shadowing is shaped by a
Nakagami-$m$ random variable (RV), an inverse Nakagami-$m$ RV or their mixture.
The double shadowed $\kappa$-$\mu$ models offer remarkable flexibility as they
include the $\kappa$-$\mu$, $\eta$-$\mu$, and the various types of single
shadowed $\kappa$-$\mu$ distribution as special cases. Moreover, we demonstrate
a practical application of the double shadowed $\kappa$-$\mu$ Type I model by
applying it to channel measurements obtained for body area networks operating

dark energy is associated with the quintessence and another in which it is
associated with the tachyon. In both, instead of choosing arbitrarily the
potential of scalar fields, these are specified implicitly by imposing that the
dark energy fields must behave as the new agegraphic dark energy. The resulting
models are compared with the Pantheon supernovae sample, CMB distance
information from Planck 2015 data, baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and
Hubble parameter data. For comparison, the noninteracting case and the $\Lambda
CDM$ model also are considered. By use of the $ AIC $ and $ BIC $ criteria, we
obtain strong evidence in favor of the two interacting models, and the coupling
constants are nonvanishing at more than $3\sigma$ confidence level.

the need to mesh complex geometries if FR is to displace current, lower order
methods, FR will likely have to be applied to stretched and warped meshes.
Therefore, it is proposed that the analytical and numerical behaviour of FR on
deformed meshes for both the 1D linear advection and the 2D Euler equations is
investigated. The analytical foundation of this work is based on a modified von
Neumann analysis for linearly deformed grids that is presented. The temporal
stability limits for linear advection on such grids are also explored
analytically and numerically, with CFL limits set out for several Runge-Kutta
schemes, with the primary trend being that contracting mesh regions give rise
to higher CFL limits whereas expansion leads to lower CFL limits. Lastly, the
benchmarks of FR are compared to finite difference and finite volumes schemes,
as are common in industry, with the comparison showing the increased wave
propagating ability on warped and stretched meshes, and hence, FR;s increased
resilience to mesh deformation.

and the powerful flare of 10 Sept. with S ~ 21000 sfu at f ~ 15 GHz (i.e., with

  Expected Hit Count",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Memory-intensive workloads operate on massive amounts of data that cannot be
captured by last-level caches (LLCs) of modern processors. Consequently,
processors encounter frequent off-chip misses, and hence, lose a significant
performance potential. One way to reduce the number of off-chip misses is
through using a well-behaved replacement policy in the LLC. Existing processors
employ a variation of least recently used (LRU) policy to determine a victim
for replacement. Unfortunately, there is a large gap between what LRU offers
and that of Belady's MIN, which is the optimal replacement policy. Belady's MIN
requires selecting a victim with the longest reuse distance, and hence, is
unfeasible due to the need to know the future. Consequently, Belady-inspired
replacement polices use Belady's MIN to derive an indicator to help them choose
a victim for replacement.
  In this work, we show that the indicator that is used in the state-of-the-art
Belady-inspired replacement policy is not decisive in picking a victim in a
considerable number of cases, and hence, the policy has to rely on a standard
metric (e.g., recency or frequency) to pick a victim, which is inefficient. We
observe that there exist strong correlations among the hit counts of cache
blocks in the same region of memory when Belady's MIN is the replacement
policy. Taking advantage of this observation, we propose an expected-hit-count
indicator for the memory regions and use it to improve the victim selection
mechanism of Belady-inspired replacement policies when the main indicator is
not decisive. Our proposal offers a 5.2\% performance improvement over the
baseline LRU and outperforms Hawkeye, which is the state-of-the-art replacement
policy.

tremendously in recent years and has shown remarkable potential for artificial
intelligence based opponents in computer games. This success is primarily due
to the vast capabilities of convolutional neural networks, that can extract
useful features from noisy and complex data. Games are excellent tools to test
and push the boundaries of novel RL algorithms because they give valuable
insight into how well an algorithm can perform in isolated environments without
the real-life consequences. Real-time strategy games (RTS) is a genre that has
tremendous complexity and challenges the player in short and long-term
planning. There is much research that focuses on applied RL in RTS games, and
novel advances are therefore anticipated in the not too distant future.
However, there are to date few environments for testing RTS AIs. Environments
in the literature are often either overly simplistic, such as microRTS, or
complex and without the possibility for accelerated learning on consumer
hardware like StarCraft II. This paper introduces the Deep RTS game environment
for testing cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms for RTS games. Deep
RTS is a high-performance RTS game made specifically for artificial
intelligence research. It supports accelerated learning, meaning that it can
learn at a magnitude of 50 000 times faster compared to existing RTS games.
Deep RTS has a flexible configuration, enabling research in several different
RTS scenarios, including partially observable state-spaces and map complexity.
We show that Deep RTS lives up to our promises by comparing its performance
with microRTS, ELF, and StarCraft II on high-end consumer hardware. Using Deep
RTS, we show that a Deep Q-Network agent beats random-play agents over 70% of
the time. Deep RTS is publicly available at https://github.com/cair/DeepRTS.

tie reinforcement due to social interactions between people. We generalize the
weighted social network model such that the nodes or individuals have $F$
features and each feature can have $q$ different values. Here the tendency for
the tie formation between two individuals due to the overlap in their features
represents homophily. We find a phase transition as a function of $F$ or $q$,
resulting in a phase diagram. For fixed $q$ and as a function of $F$ the system
shows two phases separated at $F_c$. For $F{<}F_c$ large, homogeneous, and well
separated communities can be identified within which the features match almost
perfectly (segregated phase). When $F$ becomes larger than $F_c$, the nodes
start to belong to several communities and within a community the features
match only partially (overlapping phase). Several quantities reflect this
transition, including the average degree, clustering coefficient, feature
overlap, and the number of communities per node. We also make an attempt to
interpret these results in terms of observations on social behavior of humans.

synthesis of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) requires
the precise control of numerous growth parameters. All the proposed mechanisms
and their relation to the growth conditions are inferred from characterising
intermediate formations obtained by stopping the growth blindly. To fully
understand the reaction routes that lead to the monolayer formation, real time
observation and control of the growth are needed. Here, we demonstrate how a
custom-made CVD chamber that allows real time optical monitoring can be
employed to study the reaction routes that are critical to the production of
the desired layered thin crystals in salt assisted TMDC synthesis. Our real
time observations reveal the reaction between the salt and the metallic
precursor to form intermediate compounds which lead to the layered crystal
formation. We identified that both the vapour-solid-solid and
vapour-liquid-solid growth routes are in an interplay. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the role H$_{2}$ plays in the salt-assisted WSe$_{2}$ synthesis.
Finally, we guided the crystal formation by directing the liquid intermediate
compound through pre-patterned channels. The methods presented in this article
can be extended to other materials that can be synthesized via CVD.

attributed to a two-step process: first, gas in the stellar atmosphere is
levitated by shockwaves caused by stellar pulsation, then accelerated outwards
by radiative pressure on newly formed dust, inducing a wind. Dynamical
modelling of such winds usually assumes a spherically symmetric star. We
explore the potential consequences of complex stellar surface structures, as
predicted by three-dimensional (3D) star-in-a-box modelling of M-type AGB
stars, on the resulting wind properties with the aim to improve the current
wind models. Two different modelling approaches are used; the CO$^5$BOLD 3D
star-in-a-box code to simulate the convective, pulsating interior and lower
atmosphere of the star, and the DARWIN one-dimensional (1D) code to describe
the dynamical atmosphere where the wind is accelerated. The gas dynamics of the
inner atmosphere region at distances of $R\sim1-2R_\star$, which both modelling
approaches simulate, are compared. Dynamical properties and luminosity
variations derived from CO$^5$BOLD interior models are used as input for the
inner boundary in DARWIN wind models in order to emulate the effects of giant
convection cells and pulsation, and explore their influence on the dynamical
properties. The CO$^5$BOLD models are inherently anisotropic, with non-uniform
shock fronts and varying luminosity amplitudes, in contrast to the spherically
symmetrical DARWIN wind models. DARWIN wind models with CO$^5$BOLD-derived
inner boundary conditions produced wind velocities and mass-loss rates
comparable to the standard DARWIN models, however the winds show large density
variations on time-scales of 10-20 years.

we investigate how the dynamics of inflationary cubic, quartic order and also

book our next appointment at the hair salon or at that restaurant for dinner -
machine learning systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. The main reason
for this is that these methods boast remarkable predictive capabilities.
However, most of these models remain black boxes, meaning that it is very
challenging for humans to follow and understand their intricate inner workings.
Consequently, interpretability has suffered under this ever-increasing
complexity of machine learning models. Especially with regards to new
regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the
necessity for plausibility and verifiability of predictions made by these black
boxes is indispensable. Driven by the needs of industry and practice, the
research community has recognised this interpretability problem and focussed on
developing a growing number of so-called explanation methods over the past few
years. These methods explain individual predictions made by black box machine
learning models and help to recover some of the lost interpretability. With the
proliferation of these explanation methods, it is, however, often unclear,
which explanation method offers a higher explanation quality, or is generally

perturbation can be a model for not only landslides on Earth but also
relaxations of asteroidal surface terrains. To understand such terrain
dynamics, we conduct a series of experiments of a solid-projectile impact onto
an inclined wet granular layer with various water contents and inclination
angles. As a result, we find two types of outcomes: ""crater formation"" and
""collapse"". The ""collapse"" phase is observed when the inclination angle is
close to the maximum stable angle and the impact-induced vibration at the
bottom of wet granular layer is sufficiently strong. To explain the collapse
condition, we propose a simple block model considering the maximum stable
angle, inclination angle, and impact-induced vibrational acceleration.
Additionally, the attenuating propagation of the impact-induced vibrational
acceleration is estimated on the basis of three-dimensional numerical
simulations with discrete element method using dry particles. By combining
wet-granular experiments and dry-granular simulations, we find that the
impact-induced acceleration attenuates anisotropically in space. With a help of
this attenuation form, the physical conditions to induce the collapse can be
estimated using the block model.

posing several limitations, which must be addressed to facilitate execution of
large workloads. There is no library providing a unifying interface that allows
programmers to write reusable out-of-core implementations of their
data-parallel kernels that can run efficiently on different mainstream
accelerators such as GPUs, PHIs, and FPGAs. We address this shortage in this
paper. We present a library called libhclooc, which provides a unifying
interface facilitating out-of-core implementations for data parallel kernels on
the three different mainstream accelerators (GPUs, Intel Xeon Phis, FPGAs). We
implement out-of-core matrix-matrix multiplication (MMOOC) using the libhclooc
API and demonstrate its superior performance over vendor implementations. We
show that it suffers from a maximum overhead of 10%, 4%, and 8% (due to
abstraction) compared to the state-of-the-art optimised implementations for
Nvidia K40c GPU, Nvidia P100 PCIe GPU, and Intel Xeon Phi 3120P respectively.
We also show that using libhclooc API reduces the number of lines of code (LOC)

We compute the amplitudes by dispersion relations that respect analyticity and

$N_C$ dependence of the $\pi\pi\to\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes is obtained by
comparing these amplitudes to the one of chiral perturbation theory. The
semi-local duality is investigated by varying $N_C$. Our results show that the
semi-local duality is not violated when $N_C$ is large. At large $N_C$, the
contributions of the $f_2(1270)$, the $f_0(980)$ and the $f_0(1370)$ cancel
that of the $\rho(770)$ in the finite energy sum rules, while the $f_0(500)$

Embedded DG (EDG) and the Interior Embedded DG (IEDG) methods. These methods
are amenable to hybridization (static condensation) and thus to more
computationally efficient implementations. Like other high-order DG methods,
however, they may suffer from numerical stability issues in under-resolved
fluid flow simulations. In this spirit, we introduce the hybridized DG methods
for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in entropy variables.
Under a suitable choice of the stabilization matrix, the scheme can be shown to
be entropy stable and satisfy the Second Law of Thermodynamics in an integral
sense. The performance and robustness of the proposed family of schemes are
illustrated through a series of steady and unsteady flow problems in subsonic,
transonic, and supersonic regimes. The hybridized DG methods in entropy
variables show the optimal accuracy order given by the polynomial approximation
space, and are significantly superior to their counterparts in conservation
variables in terms of stability and robustness, particularly for under-resolved

Going beyond early papers, we derive quite accurate approximations of the
respective steady-state densities of the MEWMA statistic. It turns out that
these densities could be rewritten as the product of two functions depending on
one argument only which allows feasible calculation. For proving the related
statements, the presentation of the non-central chisquare density deploying the
confluent hypergeometric limit function is applied. Using the new methods it
was found that for large dimensions, the steady-state behavior becomes
different to what one might expect from the univariate monitoring field. Based

metallic with the Nb $d$-orbital dominated energy bands near the Fermi level

agreement with neutron scattering experiments. The electron-phonon coupling
($\lambda$) in $\delta$-NbN ($\lambda=0.98$) is much stronger than in
$\varepsilon$-NbN ($\lambda=0.16$) and WC-NbN ($\lambda=0.11$). This results in
a much higher superconducting transition temperature ($T_c =18.2$ K) than in
$\varepsilon$-NbN and WC-NbN ($T_c \le 1.0$ K). The stronger $\lambda$ and
higher $T_c$ in $\delta$-NbN are attributed to its large density of states at
$E_F$ and small Debye temperature. The calculated $T_c$ of $\delta$-NbN is in
good agreement with the experimental values. However, the predicted $T_c$ of
$\varepsilon$-NbN is much smaller than the recent experiment (11.6 K) but
agrees well with the earlier experiment. Finally, the calculated relativistic
band structures reveal that all three NbN polytypes are topological metals.
Specifically, $\varepsilon$-NbN and $\delta$-NbN are, respectively, type-I and
type-II Dirac metals, while WC-NbN is an emergent topological metal that has
rare triply degenerate nodes. All these results indicate that all the three NbN
polytypes should be hard superconductors with nontrivial band topology that
would provide valuable opportunities for studying fascinating phenomena arising
from the interplay of band topology and superconductivity.

its effectiveness. While highly effective, though, the question of how to
uplift the impact of the best features for a specific query image persists as
an open computer vision problem. In this paper, we propose a computationally
efficient approach to fuse several hand-crafted and deep features, based on the
probabilistic distribution of a given membership score of a constrained cluster
in an unsupervised manner. First, we introduce an incremental nearest neighbor
(NN) selection method, whereby we dynamically select k-NN to the query. We then
build several graphs from the obtained NN sets and employ constrained dominant
sets (CDS) on each graph G to assign edge weights which consider the intrinsic
manifold structure of the graph, and detect false matches to the query.
Finally, we elaborate the computation of feature positive-impact weight (PIW)
based on the dispersive degree of the characteristics vector. To this end, we
exploit the entropy of a cluster membership-score distribution. In addition,
the final NN set bypasses a heuristic voting scheme. Experiments on several
retrieval benchmark datasets show that our method can improve the
state-of-the-art result.

years by observations from Mars Express (MEX) and lately MAVEN. A topic of
particular interest are the interactions between the planet's ionospheric
plasma and its highly structured crustal magnetic fields, and how these lead to
the redistribution of plasma and affect the propagation of radio waves in the
system. In this paper, we elucidate a possible relationship between two
anomalous radar signatures previously reported in observations from the MARSIS
instrument on MEX. Relatively uncommon observations of localized, extreme
increases in the ionospheric peak density in regions of radial (cusp-like)
magnetic fields and spread-echo radar signatures are shown to be coincident
with ducting of the same radar pulses at higher altitudes on the same field
lines. We suggest that these two observations are both caused by a high
electric field (perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$) having distinctly different
effects in two altitude regimes. At lower altitudes, where ions are
demagnetized and electrons magnetized, and recombination dominantes, a high
electric field causes irregularities, plasma turbulence, electron heating,
slower recombination and ultimately enhanced plasma densities. However, at
higher altitudes, where both ions and electrons are magnetized and atomic
oxygen ions cannot recombine directly, the high electric field instead causes
frictional heating, a faster production of molecular ions by charge exchange,
and so a density decrease. The latter enables ducting of radar pulses on closed
field lines, in an analogous fashion to inter-hemispheric ducting in the
Earth's ionosphere.

  Videos","Accepted by ACM Multimedia",,"10.1145/3240508.3240534",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video Analytics Software as a Service (VA SaaS) has been rapidly growing in
recent years. VA SaaS is typically accessed by users using a lightweight
client. Because the transmission bandwidth between the client and cloud is
usually limited and expensive, it brings great benefits to design cloud video
analysis algorithms with a limited data transmission requirement. Although
considerable research has been devoted to video analysis, to our best
knowledge, little of them has paid attention to the transmission bandwidth
limitation in SaaS. As the first attempt in this direction, this work
introduces a problem of few-frame action recognition, which aims at maintaining
high recognition accuracy, when accessing only a few frames during both
training and test. Unlike previous work that processed dense frames, we present
Temporal Sequence Distillation (TSD), which distills a long video sequence into
a very short one for transmission. By end-to-end training with 3D CNNs for
video action recognition, TSD learns a compact and discriminative temporal and
spatial representation of video frames. On Kinetics dataset, TSD+I3D typically
requires only 50\% of the number of frames compared to I3D, a state-of-the-art
video action recognition algorithm, to achieve almost the same accuracies. The
proposed TSD has three appealing advantages. Firstly, TSD has a lightweight
architecture and can be deployed in the client, eg. mobile devices, to produce
compressed representative frames to save transmission bandwidth. Secondly, TSD
significantly reduces the computations to run video action recognition with
compressed frames on the cloud, while maintaining high recognition accuracies.
Thirdly, TSD can be plugged in as a preprocessing module of any existing 3D
CNNs. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and characteristics of TSD.

we study two relativity-induced properties of atomically thin ferromagnetic
(FM) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ films [monolayer (ML), bilayer (BL) and trilayer (TL)
as well as bulk], namely, magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and magneto-optical
(MO) effects. Competing contributions of both magneto-crystalline anisotropy
energy (C-MAE) and magnetic dipolar anisotropy energy (D-MAE) to the MAE, are
computed. Calculated MAEs of these materials are large, being in the order of
$\sim$0.1 meV/Cr. Interestingly, we find that the out-of-plane magnetic
anisotropy is preferred in all the systems except the ML where an in-plane
magnetization is favored because here the D-MAE is larger than the C-MAE.
Crucially, this explains why long-range FM order was observed in all the
few-layer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ except the ML because the out-of-plane magnetic
anisotropy would open a spin-wave gap and thus suppress magnetic fluctuations
so that long-range FM order could be stabilized at finite temperature. In the
visible frequency range, large Kerr rotations up to $\sim$1.0 deg in these
materials are predicted and they are comparable to that observed in famous MO
materials such as PtMnSb and Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$. Moreover, they are $\sim$100
times larger than that of 3$d$ transition metal MLs deposited on Au surfaces.
Faraday rotation angles in these 2D materials are also large, being up to
$\sim$120 deg/$\mu$m, and are thus comparable to the best-known MO
semiconductor Bi$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$. These findings thus suggest that with large
MAE and MO effects, atomically thin Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ films would have
potential applications in novel magnetic, MO and spintronic nanodevices.

Despite of the prolific advantages of VLC networks, VLC faces many challenges
that must be resolved in the near future to achieve a full standardization and
to be integrated to future wireless systems. Here, we review the new, emerging
research in the field of VLC networks and lay out the challenges, technological
solutions, and future work predictions. Specifically, we first review the VLC
channel capacity derivation, discuss the performance metrics and the associated
variables; the optimization of VLC networks are also discussed, including
resources and power allocation techniques, user-to-access point (AP)

energy harvesting and information transmission using the visible light, and the
security issue in VLC networks. Finally, we propose several open research

a regime where two asymptotic states can be realised. The warm state we live in
is in competition with the ice-covered snowball state. The bistability exists
as a result of the positive ice-albedo feedback. In a previous investigation
performed on a intermediate complexity climate model we have identified the
unstable climate states (Melancholia states) separating the co-existing
climates, and studied their dynamical and geometrical properties. The
Melancholia states are ice-covered up to the mid-latitudes and attract
trajectories initialised on the basins boundary. In this paper, we study how
stochastically perturbing the parameter controlling the intensity of the
incoming solar radiation impacts the stability of the climate. We detect
transitions between the warm and the snowball state and analyse in detail the
properties of the noise-induced escapes from the corresponding basins of
attraction. We determine the most probable paths for the transitions and find
evidence that the Melancholia states act as gateways, similarly to saddle
points in an energy landscape.

vital for human civilization. Preliminary analysis suggests that Near-Earth
Asteroids (NEA) contain enough volatile and high value minerals to make the
mining process economically feasible. Considering possible applications,
specifically the mining of water in space has become a major focus for
near-term options. Most proposed projects for asteroid mining involve
spacecraft based on traditional designs resulting in large, monolithic and
expensive systems.
  An alternative approach is presented in this paper, basing the asteroid
mining process on multiple small spacecraft. To the best knowledge of the
authors, only limited analysis of the asteroid mining capability of small
spacecraft has been conducted. This paper explores the possibility to perform
asteroid mining operations with spacecraft that have a mass under 500 kg and
deliver 100 kg of water per trip. The mining process considers water extraction
through microwave heating with an efficiency of 2 Wh/g.The proposed, small
spacecraft can reach NEAs within a range of $\sim 0.03$ AU relative to earth's
orbit, offering a delta V of 437 m/s per one-way trip.
  A high-level systems engineering and economic analysis provides a closed
spacecraft design as a baseline and puts the cost of the proposed spacecraft at
$ 113.6 million/unit. The results indicate that more than one hundred
spacecraft and their successful operation for over five years are required to
achieve a financial break-even point. Pros and cons of using small spacecraft
swarms are highlighted and the uncertainties associated with cost and profit of
space related business ventures are analyzed.

physics, which are also suggested as promising candidates to build
fault-tolerant quantum devices. However, it is still elusive how topological
orders can be affected or detected under noises. In this work, we find a
quantity, termed as the ring degeneracy $\mathcal{D}$, which is robust under
pure noise to detect both trivial and intrinsic topological orders. The ring
degeneracy is defined as the degeneracy of the solutions of the self-consistent
equations that encode the contraction of the corresponding tensor network(TN).
For the $Z_N$ orders, we find that the ring degeneracy satisfies a simple
relation $\mathcal{D} = (N + 1)/2 + d$, with $d = 0$ for odd $N$ and $d = 1/2$
for even $N$. Simulations on several non-trivial states (two-dimensional Ising
model, $Z_N$ topological states, and resonating valence bond states) show that
the ring degeneracy can tolerate noises up to a strength associated to the gap
of the TN boundary theory.

Atacama Desert, designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with
arcminute resolution. ACT, with its third generation polarization sensitive
array, Advanced ACTPol, is being used to measure the anisotropies of the CMB in
five frequency bands in large areas of the sky ($\sim 15,000$ $\rm deg^2$).
These measurements are designed to characterize the large scale structure of
the universe, test cosmological models and constrain the sum of the neutrino
masses. As the sensitivity of these wide surveys increases, the control and
validation of the far sidelobe response becomes increasingly important and is
particularly challenging as multiple reflections, spillover, diffraction and
scattering become difficult to model and characterize at the required levels.
In this work, we present a ray trace model of the ACT upper structure which is
used to describe much of the observed far sidelobe pattern. This model combines
secondary mirror spillover measurements with a 3D CAD model based on
photogrammetry measurements to simulate the beam of the camera and the comoving
ground shield. This simulation shows qualitative agreement with physical optics
tools and features observed in far sidelobe measurements. We present this
method as an efficient first-order calculation that, although it does not
capture all diffraction effects, informs interactions between the structural
components of the telescope and the optical path, which can then be combined
with more computationally intensive physical optics calculations. This method
can be used to predict sidelobe patterns in the design stage of future optical
systems such as the Simons Observatory, CCAT-prime, and CMB Stage IV.

mutual Coulomb repulsion is studied in the framework of a recently developed
hybrid model. The latter is based on the Statistical Mul- tifragmentation Model
(SMM), describing the prompt breakup of the source, whereas the particle
emission from the hot fragments, that decay while traveling away from each
other, is treated by the Weisskopf-Ewing evaporation model. Since this
treatment provides an event by event descrip- tion of the process, in which the
classical trajectories of the fragments are followed using molecular dynamics
techniques, it allows one to study observables such as two-particle
correlations and infer the extent to which the corresponding observables may
provide information on the multifragment production mechanisms. Our results
suggest that the framework on which these treatments are based may be
considerably constrained by such analyses. Furthermore, they imply that
information obtained from these model calculations may provide feedback to the
theory of nuclear interferome- try. We also found that neutron deficient
fragments should hold information more closely related to the breakup region
than neutron rich ones, as they are produced in much earlier stages of the post
breakup dynamics than the latter.

color into analysis can help distinguish between the contribution of the host

emission at least 20-50pc long is required to explain the Gaia positions
located downstream from VLBI ones. Offsets in the upstream direction of up to 2

Gaia coordinates and by the effects of parsec-scale radio jet. The host galaxy
was found not to play an important role in the detected offsets. BL Lacertae
object and Seyfert 2 galaxies are observationally confirmed to have a
relatively weak disk and consequently downstream offsets. The disk emission
drives upstream offsets in a significant fraction of quasars and Seyfert 1

heavy load to wireless networks. Except for further improving viewing
experience, view synthesis can create multicast opportunities for efficient
transmission of MVVs in multiuser wireless networks, which has not been
recognized in existing literature. In this paper, we would like to exploit view
synthesis-enabled multicast opportunities for energy-efficient MVV transmission
in a multiuser wireless network. Specifically, we first establish a
mathematical model to characterize the impact of view synthesis on multicast
opportunities and energy consumption. Then, we consider the optimization of
view selection, transmission time and power allocation to minimize the weighted
sum energy consumption for view transmission and synthesis, which is a
challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. We propose an
algorithm to obtain an optimal solution with reduced computational complexity
by exploiting optimality properties. To further reduce computational
complexity, we also propose two low-complexity algorithms to obtain two
suboptimal solutions, based on continuous relaxation and Difference of Convex

progress in symbolic motion planning, many challenges remain, including
addressing scalability for multi-robot systems and improving solutions by
incorporating human intelligence. In this paper, distributed symbolic motion
planning for multi-robot systems is developed to address scalability. More
specifically, compositional reasoning approaches are developed to decompose the
global planning problem, and atomic propositions for observation,
communication, and control are proposed to address inter-robot collision
avoidance. To improve solution quality and adaptability, a dynamic,
quantitative, and probabilistic human-to-robot trust model is developed to aid
this decomposition. Furthermore, a trust-based real-time switching framework is
proposed to switch between autonomous and manual motion planning for tradeoffs
between task safety and efficiency. Deadlock- and livelock-free algorithms are
designed to guarantee reachability of goals with a human-in-the-loop. A set of
non-trivial multi-robot simulations with direct human input and trust

significant challenges for computational models. Various recurrent neural

paper, we explore the capacity of different RNN extensions to model LDDs, by
evaluating these models on a sequence of SPk synthesized datasets, where each
subsequent dataset exhibits a longer degree of LDD. Even though SPk are simple

in less than 1ms. We test our algorithm on a subset of the UK Biobank dataset
consisting of 3465 CMR images and achieve not only high accuracy in detection
of motion artefacts, but also high precision and recall. We compare our
approach to a range of state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

strategies for telescopes located in Chile that are informed by the tools used
to develop recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Polarbear surveys. As
with ACT and Polarbear, these strategies are composed of scans that sweep in
azimuth at constant elevation. We explore observing strategies for both small
(0.42 m) aperture telescopes (SAT) and a large (6 m) aperture telescope (LAT).
We study strategies focused on small sky areas to search for inflationary
gravitational waves as well as strategies spanning roughly half the
low-foreground sky to constrain the effective number of relativistic species
and measure the sum of neutrino masses via the gravitational lensing signal due
to large scale structure. We present these strategies specifically considering
the telescope hardware and science goals of the SO, located at 23 degrees South
latitude, 67.8 degrees West longitude. Observations close to the Sun and the
Moon can introduce additional systematics by applying additional power to the
instrument through telescope sidelobes. Significant side lobe contamination in
the data can occur even at tens of degrees or more from bright sources.
Therefore, we present several strategies that implement Sun and Moon avoidance
constraints into the telescope scheduling. Strategies for resolving conflicts
between simultaneously visible fields are discussed. We focus on maximizing
telescope time spent on science observations. It will also be necessary to
schedule calibration measurements, however that is beyond the scope of this
work. The outputs of this study are algorithms that can generate specific
schedule commands for the Simons Observatory instruments.

where no training set exists that exactly matches the end-users task and
circumstances. With our approach we show improved performance as the number of
subjects in the cBCI ensemble grows, and the potential to reconstruct

effect, allowing a rigorous derivation of an order parameter for large

models including networks of Kuramoto oscillators, theta models, and
integrate-and-fire neurons, along with many types of network topologies. In the

slow synapses, predict the synchronization properties of finite neural
populations. The slow synapse assumption is amenable to averaging theory and
the method of multiple timescales. Our proposed theory applies to two
heterogeneous populations of N excitatory n-dimensional and N inhibitory
m-dimensional oscillators with homogeneous synaptic weights. We then
demonstrate our theory using two examples. In the first example we take a
network of excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons and consider the case with
and without heterogeneous inputs. In the second example we use Traub models
with calcium for the excitatory neurons and Wang-Buzs{\'a}ki models for the
inhibitory neurons. We accurately predict phase drift and phase locking in each

grains of all sizes sediment at the same collective speed as long as Stokes

planetary cores form if pebble size exceeds a few cm. Pebble growth leads to
core formation in some hundreds of years even when pebbles injected into clumps

  Applications",,,,"math.AP math.CA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The \textit{method of semigroups} is a unifying, widely applicable, general
technique to formulate and analyze fundamental aspects of fractional powers of
operators $L$ and their regularity properties in related functional spaces. The
approach was introduced by the author and Jos\'e L.~Torrea in 2009
(arXiv:0910.2569v1). The aim of this chapter is to show how the method works in
the particular case of the fractional Laplacian $L^s=(-\Delta)^s$, $0<s<1$. The
starting point is the semigroup formula for the fractional Laplacian. From
here, the classical heat kernel permits us to obtain the pointwise formula for
$(-\Delta)^su(x)$. One of the key advantages is that our technique relies on
the use of heat kernels, which allows for applications in settings where the
Fourier transform is not the most suitable tool. In addition, it provides
explicit constants that are key to prove, under minimal conditions on $u$, the
validity of the pointwise limits $$\lim_{s\to1^-}(-\Delta)^su(x)=-\Delta
u(x)\quad\hbox{and}\quad\lim_{s\to0^+}(-\Delta)^su(x)=u(x).$$ The formula for
the solution to the Poisson problem $(-\Delta)^su=f$ is found through the
semigroup approach as the inverse of the fractional Laplacian
$u(x)=(-\Delta)^{-s}f(x)$ (fundamental solution). We then present the
Caffarelli--Silvestre extension problem, whose explicit solution is given by
the semigroup formulas that were first discovered by the author and Torrea.
With the extension technique, an interior Harnack inequality and derivative
estimates for fractional harmonic functions can be obtained. The classical
H\""older and Schauder estimates $$(-\Delta)^{\pm s}:C^\alpha\to C^{\alpha\mp
2s}$$ are proved with the method of semigroups in a rather quick, elegant way.
The crucial point for this will be the characterization of H\""older and Zygmund
spaces with heat semigroups.

can be shown for all Morse functions. The main theoretical result of this paper
is as follows.
  Theorem. Let $f:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a $C^1$ function, and
$\{z_n\}$ a sequence constructed from the Backtracking gradient descent
algorithm. (1) Either $\lim _{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_n||=\infty$ or $\lim
_{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_{n+1}-z_n||=0$. (2) Assume that $f$ has at most
countably many critical points. Then either $\lim
_{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_n||=\infty$ or $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point
of $f$. (3) More generally, assume that all connected components of the set of
critical points of $f$ are compact. Then either $\lim
_{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_n||=\infty$ or $\{z_n\}$ is bounded. Moreover, in the
latter case the set of cluster points of $\{z_n\}$ is connected.
  Some generalised versions of this result, including an inexact version, are
included. Another result in this paper concerns the problem of saddle points.
We then present a heuristic argument to explain why Standard gradient descent
method works so well, and modifications of the backtracking versions of GD, MMT
and NAG. Experiments with datasets CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 on various popular
architectures verify the heuristic argument also for the mini-batch practice

assimilation in a general situation, that is, for nonlinear forecast and

traditionally force us to choose between inaccurate Gaussian assumptions that
permit efficient algorithms (e.g., EnKF), or more accurate direct sampling
methods which scale poorly with dimension (e.g., particle filters, or PF). We
introduce a trimmed ensemble Kalman filter (TEnKF) which can interpolate
between the limiting distributions of the EnKF and PF to facilitate adaptive
control over both accuracy and efficiency. This is achieved by introducing a
trimming function that removes non-Gaussian outliers that introduce errors in
the correlation between the model and observed forecast, which otherwise
prevent the EnKF from proposing accurate forecast updates. We show for specific
trimming functions that the TEnKF exactly reproduces the limiting distributions
of the EnKF and PF. We also develop an adaptive implementation which provides
control of the effective sample size and allows the filter to overcome periods
of increased model nonlinearity. This algorithm allow us to demonstrate
substantial improvements over the traditional EnKF in convergence and
robustness for the nonlinear Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 models.

lower-order moment model correction is a promising idea to accelerate the
steady-state computation of high-order moment models of the Boltzmann equation.
To develop the existing solver, the following aspects are studied in this
paper. First, the finite volume method with linear reconstruction is employed
for high-resolution spatial discretization so that the degrees of freedom in
spatial space could be reduced remarkably without loss of accuracy. Second, by
introducing an appropriate parameter $\tau$ in the correction step, it is found
that the performance of the solver can be improved significantly, i.e., more
levels would be involved in the solver, which further accelerates the
convergence of the method. Third, Heun's method is employed as the smoother in
each level to enhance the robustness of the solver. Numerical experiments in
microflows are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and to investigate the
behavior of the new solver. In addition, several order reduction strategies for
the choice of the order sequence of the solver are tested, and the strategy
$m_{l-1} = \lceil m_{l} / 2 \rceil$ is found to be most efficient.

coding scheme that utilizes the randomness provided by the DMC to reduce the
amount of local randomness required to generate the sequence of actions at Node

capacity region for two special cases of the noisy strong coordination setup,
namely, when the actions at Node $Y$ are determined by Node $X$ and when the
DMC is a deterministic channel. The second scheme exploits separate
coordination and channel coding where local randomness is extracted from the
channel after decoding. The third scheme is a joint coordination-channel polar
coding scheme for strong coordination. We show that polar codes are able to
achieve the established inner bound to the noisy strong coordination capacity
region and thus provide a constructive alternative to a random coding proof.
Our polar coding scheme also offers a constructive solution to a channel
simulation problem where a DMC and shared randomness are employed together to
simulate another DMC. Finally, by leveraging the random coding results for this
problem, we present an example in which the proposed joint scheme is able to
strictly outperform the separate scheme in terms of achievable communication
rate for the same amount of injected randomness into both systems. Thus, we

instability and heat transfer of natural convection in a cavity with thin
fin(s). The left and the right walls of the cavity are differentially heated.
The cavity is given an initial temperature, and the thin fin(s) is fixed on the
hot wall in order to control the heat transfer. The finite volume method and
the SIMPLE algorithm are used to simulate the flow. Distributions of the
temperature, the pressure, the velocity and the total pressure are obtained.
Then, the energy gradient theory is employed to study the physical mechanism of
flow instability and the effect of the thin fin(s) on heat transfer. Based on
the energy gradient theory, the energy gradient function K represents the
characteristic of flow instability. It is observed from the simulation results
that the positions where instabilities take place in the temperature contours
accord well with those of higher K value, which demonstrates that the energy
gradient theory reveals the physical mechanism of flow instability.
Furthermore, the effects of the fin length, the fin position, the fin number,
and Ra on heat transfer are investigated. It is found that the effect of the
fin length on heat transfer is negligible when Ra is relatively high. When
there is only one fin, the most efficient heat transfer rate is achieved as the
fin is fixed at the middle height of the cavity. The fin blocks heat transfer
with a relatively small Ra, but the fin enhances heat transfer with a
relatively large Ra. The fin(s) enhances heat transfer gradually with the
increase of Ra under the influence of the thin fin(s). Finally, a linear
correlation of Kmax with Ra is obtained which reveals the physical mechanism of
natural convection from different approaches.

continuity/heterogeneity in the regular spatial domain. In this article, we
introduce a more generalized model based on graph convolutional neural networks
(GCNs) that can capture the complex parameters of spatial patterns underlying
graph-structured spatial data, which generally contain both Euclidean spatial
information and non-Euclidean feature information. A trainable semi-supervised
prediction framework is proposed to model the spatial distribution patterns of
intra-urban points of interest(POI) check-ins. This work demonstrates the
feasibility of GCNs in complex geographic decision problems and provides a
promising tool to analyze irregular spatial data.
