existing depth-image-based face recognition methods still suffer from noisy
depth values and varying poses and expressions. In this paper, we propose a
novel method for normalizing facial depth images to frontal pose and neutral
expression and extracting robust features from the normalized depth images. The
method is implemented via two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN),
normalization network ($Net_{N}$) and feature extraction network ($Net_{F}$).
Given a facial depth image, $Net_{N}$ first converts it to an HHA image, from
which the 3D face is reconstructed via a DCNN. $Net_{N}$ then generates a
pose-and-expression normalized (PEN) depth image from the reconstructed 3D
face. The PEN depth image is finally passed to $Net_{F}$, which extracts a
robust feature representation via another DCNN for face recognition. Our
preliminary evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method in recognizing faces of arbitrary poses and expressions with depth
images.

coherent in space and time. Each day in the monsoon season is assigned
precisely one of the spatial patterns, that approximates the spatial

particular, we use these spatio-temporal patterns to study the variation of

three families of patterns distinguished by their total rainfall amount and
geographic spread. These families are then used to establish `active' and
`break' spells of the Indian monsoon at the all-India level. Subsequently, we
characterize the behavior of these patterns in time by estimating probabilities
of transition from one pattern to another across days in a season. Patterns
tend to be `sticky': the self-transition is the most common. We also identify
most commonly occurring sequences of patterns. This leads to a simple seasonal
evolution model for the summer monsoon rainfall. The discrete representation
introduced in the companion paper also identifies typical temporal rainfall
patterns for individual locations. This enables us to determine wet and dry
spells at local and regional scales. Lastly, we specify sets of locations that
tend to have such spells simultaneously, and thus come up with a new
regionalization of the landmass.

predicts a transition between warmer atmospheres with thermal inversions and
cooler atmospheres without inversions, but the exact transition point is
unknown. In order to further investigate this issue, we observed two secondary
eclipses of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3
instrument and combined these data with previous Spitzer and Kepler secondary
eclipse observations. The HST and Spitzer data can be well fit by a blackbody
with $T=2692 \pm 14$ K, and the Kepler data point constrains the geometric
albedo to $A_{g}=0.077 \pm 0.006$. We modeled these data with a 3D GCM and 1D
self-consistent forward models. The 1D models indicate that the atmosphere has
a thermal inversion, weak heat redistribution, and water dissociation that
limits the range of pressures probed. This result suggests that WFC3
observations of HAT-P-7b and possibly some other ultra-hot Jupiters appear
blackbody-like because they probe a region near the tropopause where the
atmospheric temperature changes slowly with pressure. Additionally, the 1D
models constrain the atmospheric metallicity
($[\text{M/H}]=-0.87^{+0.38}_{-0.34}$) and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O $<1$
at 99 % confidence). The solar composition 3D GCM matches the Spitzer data but
generally underpredicts the flux in the WFC3 bandpass and cannot reproduce its
featureless shape. This discrepancy could be explained by high atmospheric drag
or nightside clouds, and may be better understood through further observation
with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities containing a Kerr medium. This equation is an
extension of the equation that describes dynamics in Kerr-nonlinear ring
resonators, referred to as the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) due to its
formulation by Lugiato and Lefever in 1987. We use the new equation to study
the properties of Kerr frequency combs in FP resonators. The derivation of the
equation starts from the set of Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the
dynamics of the forward and backward propagating envelopes of the electric
field coupled to the atomic polarization and population difference variables in
a FP cavity. The final equation is formulated in terms of an auxiliary field
$\psi(z,t)$ that evolves over a slow time $t$ on the domain $-L \leq z \leq L$
with periodic boundary conditions, where $L$ is the cavity length. We describe
how the forward and backward propagating field envelopes are obtained after
solving the equation for $\psi$. This formulation makes the comparison between
the FP and ring geometries straightforward. The FP equation includes an
additional nonlinear term relative to the LLE for the ring cavity, with the
effect that the value of the detuning parameter $\alpha$ of the ring LLE is
increased by twice the average of $|\psi|^2$. This feature establishes a
connection between the stationary phenomena in the two geometries. For the
FP-LLE, we discuss the linear stability analysis of the flat stationary
solutions, analytic approximations of solitons, Turing patterns, and
nonstationary patterns. We note that Turing patterns with different numbers of
rolls may exist for the same values of the system parameters. We then discuss
some implications of the nonlinear integral term in the FP-LLE for the kind of
experiments which have been conducted in Kerr-nonlinear ring resonators.

axion condensates. Due to gravitational attraction and self-interactions, they
can organize into spatial localized clumps, whose properties were examined by
us in Refs. [1, 2]. Since the axion condensate is coherently oscillating, it
can conceivably lead to parametric resonance of photons, leading to exponential
growth in photon occupancy number and subsequent radio wave emission. We show
that while resonance always exists for spatially homogeneous condensates, its
existence for a spatially localized clump condensate depends sensitively on the
size of clump, strength of axion-photon coupling, and field amplitude. By
decomposing the electromagnetic field into vector spherical harmonics, we are
able to numerically compute the resonance from clumps for arbitrary parameters.
We find that for spherically symmetric clumps, which are the true BEC ground
states, the resonance is absent for conventional values of the QCD axion-photon
coupling, but it is present for axions with moderately large couplings, or into
hidden sector photons, or from scalar dark matter with repulsive interactions.
We extend these results to non-spherically symmetric clumps, organized by
finite angular momentum, and find that even QCD axion clumps with conventional
couplings can undergo resonant decay for sufficiently large angular momentum.
We discuss possible astrophysical consequences of these results, including the
idea of a pile-up of clump masses and rapid electromagnetic emission in the sky
from mergers.

must both agree on a time window, which ideally is rather short, during which

Time Windows forms the underlying optimization problem of the AHD system. In
this work, we consider an AHD system that runs the online grocery shopping
service of an international grocery retailer. The ordering phase, during which
customers place their orders through the web service, is the computationally
most challenging part of the AHD system. The delivery schedule must be built
dynamically as new orders are placed. We propose a solution approach that
allows to (non-stochastically) determine which delivery time windows can be
offered to potential customers. We split the computations of the ordering phase
into four key steps. For performing these basic steps we suggest both a
heuristic approach and a hybrid approach employing mixed-integer linear
programs. In an experimental evaluation we demonstrate the efficiency of our

underestimates the bandgap - as is the case with local density approximation

computationally demanding, as is the case with hybrid-functional methods. The
latter can become prohibitive in electronic-structure calculations of
supercells which describe quantum wells. We propose to apply the DFT$+U$
method, with $U$ for each atomic shell being treated as set of tuning
parameters, to automatically fit the bulk bandgap and the lattice constant, and
then use thus obtained $U$ parameters in large supercell calculations to
determine the band alignment. We apply this procedure to

InP/In$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$As quantum wells, and obtain good agreement with
experimental results. Although this procedure requires some experimental input,
it provides both meaningful valence and conduction band offsets while,
crucially, lattice relaxation is taken into account. The computational cost of
this procedure is comparable to that of LDA. We believe that this is a
practical procedure that can be useful for providing accurate estimate of band

needs/expectations and organizations actions. To bridge this gap we create
Viscovery, a platform for opinion summarization and trend tracking that is able
to analyze a stream of opinions recovered from forums. To do this we use
dynamic topic models, allowing to uncover the hidden structure of topics behind
opinions, characterizing vocabulary dynamics. We extend dynamic topic models
for incremental learning, a key aspect needed in Viscovery for model updating
in near-real time. In addition, we include in Viscovery sentiment analysis,
allowing to separate positive/negative words for a specific topic at different
levels of granularity. Viscovery allows to visualize representative opinions
and terms in each topic. At a coarse level of granularity, the dynamic of the
topics can be analyzed using a 2D topic embedding, suggesting longitudinal
topic merging or segmentation. In this paper we report our experience
developing this platform, sharing lessons learned and opportunities that arise
from the use of sentiment analysis and topic modeling in real world
applications.

discs. It affects planet formation, vertical settling and is one possible
origin of the large scale axisymmetric structures, such as rings, recently
imaged by ALMA and SPHERE. Among the variety of MHD processes, the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) has raised particular interest since it
provides a source of turbulence and potentially organizes the flow into radial
structures. However, the weak ionization of discs prevents the MRI from being
excited beyond 1 AU. The strong sedimentation of millimetre dust measured in
T-Tauri discs is also in contradiction with predictions based on ideal MRI
turbulence. In this paper, we study the effects of non-ideal MHD and winds on
the dynamics and sedimentation of dust grains. We consider a weakly ionized
plasma subject to ambipolar diffusion characterizing the disc outer regions (>1
AU). For that, we perform numerical MHD simulations in the stratified shearing
box, using the PLUTO code. Our simulations show that the mm-cm dust is
contained vertically in a very thin layer, with typical heightscale ~0.4 AU at
30 AU, compatible with recent ALMA observations. Horizontally, the grains are
trapped within pressure maxima induced by ambipolar diffusion, leading to the
formation of dust rings. For micrometer grains, dust and gas scaleheights are
similar. In this regime, the settling cannot be explained by a simple 1D
diffusion theory but results from a large scale 2D circulation induced by both
MHD winds and zonal flows. Overall, our results show that non-ideal MHD effects
and their related winds play a major role in shaping the radial and vertical
distribution of dust in protoplanetary discs. Leading to substantial accretion
efficiency, non-ideal effects also a promising avenue to reconcile the low
turbulent activity measured in discs with their relatively high accretion
rates.

cannot be explained by synchrotron radiation, thermal dust emission, or
optically thin free-free radiation. Spinning dust is one variety of AME that
could be partially polarized and therefore relevant for ongoing and future
cosmic microwave background polarization studies. The Planck satellite mission
identified candidate AME regions in approximately $1^\circ$ patches that were
found to have spectra generally consistent with spinning dust grain models. The
spectra for one of these regions, G107.2+5.2, was also consistent with
optically thick free-free emission because of a lack of measurements between 2
and 20 GHz. Follow-up observations were needed. Therefore, we used the C-band
receiver (4 to 8 GHz) and the VEGAS spectrometer at the Green Bank Telescope to
constrain the AME mechanism. For the study described in this paper, we produced
three band averaged maps at 4.575, 5.625, and 6.125 GHz and used aperture
photometry to measure the spectral flux density in the region relative to the
background. We found if the spinning dust description is correct, then the
spinning dust signal peaks at $30.9 \pm 1.4$ GHz, and it explains the excess
emission. The morphology and spectrum together suggest the spinning dust grains
are concentrated near S140, which is a star forming region inside our chosen
photometry aperture. If the AME is sourced by optically thick free-free
radiation, then the region would have to contain HII with an emission measure
of $5.27^{+2.5}_{-1.5}\times 10^8$ $\rm{cm^{-6}\,pc}$ and a physical extent of
$1.01^{+0.21}_{-0.20} \times 10^{-2}\,\rm{pc}$. This result suggests the HII
would have to be ultra or hyper compact to remain an AME candidate.

intensity-invariance based improved grouping for collaborative support-agnostic

patches via intensity-invariant correlation measure. The grouped patches
collaborate to yield desirable sparse estimates for noise filtering. This is
because similar patches share the same support in the transformed domain, such
similar supports can be used as probabilities of active taps to refine the
sparse estimates. This ultimately produces a very useful patch estimate thus
increasing the quality of recovered image by discarding the noise-causing
components. A region growing based spatially developed post-processor is then
applied to further enhance the smooth regions by extracting the spatial domain
features. We also extend our proposed method for denoising of color images.
Comparison results with the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PNSR) and structural similarity (SSIM) index from

least four sub-clusters, and it is known to host a radio halo. LOFAR
observations reveal new sources of radio emission in the Intra-Cluster Medium:
(i) a radio bridge that connects the cluster to a head-tail radio galaxy
located along a filament of galaxies falling into the main cluster, (ii) a 1.9
Mpc radio arc, that is located North West of the main mass component, (iii)
radio emission along the X-ray bar, that traces the gas in the X-rays South
West of the cluster centre. We use deep GMRT observations at 608 MHz to
constrain the spectral indices of these new radio sources, and of the emission
that was already studied in the literature at higher frequency. We find that
the spectrum of the radio halo and of the relic at LOFAR frequency follows the
same power law as observed at higher frequencies. The radio bridge, the radio
arc, and the radio bar all have steep spectra, which can be used to constrain
the particle acceleration mechanisms. We argue that the radio bridge could be
caused by the re-acceleration of electrons by shock waves that are injected
along the filament during the cluster mass assembly. Despite the sensitivity
reached by our observations, the emission from the radio halo does not trace
the emission of the gas revealed by X-ray observations. We argue that this
could be due to the difference in the ratio of kinetic over thermal energy of
the intra-cluster gas, suggested by X-ray observations.

radii of the black hole, $\sim 32$ times further in than in previous work. We
reproduce reasonably well the diffuse thermal X-ray emission observed by
Chandra in the central parsec. The resulting accretion flow at small radii is a
superposition of two components: 1) a moderately unbound, sub-Keplerian, thick,
pressure-supported disc that is at most (but not all) times aligned with the
clockwise stellar disc, and 2) a bound, low-angular momentum inflow that
proceeds primarily along the southern pole of the disc. We interpret this
structure as a natural consequence of a few of the innermost stellar winds
dominating accretion, which produces a flow with a broad distribution of
angular momentum. Including the star S2 in the simulation has a negligible
effect on the flow structure. Extrapolating our results from simulations with
different inner radii, we find an accretion rate of $\sim$ a few $\times

modeling the observed emission of Sgr A*. The flow structure found here can be
used as more realistic initial conditions for horizon scale simulations of Sgr
A*.

($\sim10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) infrared-dark cloud filament. It is still accreting
molecular gas as well as driving a $\sim 0.2$ pc ionised gas outflow
perpendicular to the filament. Intriguingly, we observe a large velocity
gradient ($47.81 \pm 3.21$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$) across the ionised gas in a
direction perpendicular to the outflow. This kinematic signature of the ionised
gas shows a reasonable correspondence with the simulations of young H II
regions. Based on a qualitative comparison between our observations and these

observed in G$316.81-0.06$. If the velocity gradient perpendicular to the
outflow is caused by rotation of the ionised gas, then we infer that this
rotation is a direct result of the initial net angular momentum in the natal
molecular cloud. If this explanation is correct, this kinematic signature
should be common in other young (bipolar) H II regions. We suggest that further
quantitative analysis of the ionised gas kinematics of young H II regions,

using data from the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) and the
Dark Energy Survey. We detect a ring-like stellar overdensity in the red clump
star count map at a radius of ~6 degrees (~5.2 kpc at the LMC distance) that is
continuous over ~270 degrees in position angle and is only limited by the
current data coverage. The overdensity shows an amplitude up to 2.5 times
higher than that of the underlying smooth disk. This structure might be related
to the multiple arms found by de Vaucouleurs. We find that the overdensity
shows spatial correlation with intermediate-age star clusters, but not with
young (< 1 Gyr) main-sequence stars, indicating the stellar populations
associated with the overdensity are intermediate in age or older. Our findings
on the LMC overdensity can be explained by either of two distinct formation
mechanisms of a ring-like overdensity: (1) the overdensity formed out of an
asymmetric one-armed spiral wrapping around the LMC main body, which is induced
by repeated encounters with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) over the last Gyr,
or (2) the overdensity formed very recently as a tidal response to a direct
collision with the SMC. Although the measured properties of the overdensity
alone cannot distinguish between the two candidate scenarios, the consistency
with both scenarios suggests that the ring-like overdensity is likely a product
of tidal interaction with the SMC, but not with the Milky Way halo.

pressure-supported systems like dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We construct
an estimator for enclosed masses based on the virial theorem which is
insensitive to anisotropy in the velocity dispersion and tailored to yield
masses with minimum uncertainty introduced by our ignorance on (i) the shape of
the inner halo profile, and (ii) how deeply the stellar component is embedded
within the halo: $M(<1.8\,R_\mathrm{h}) \approx 3.5 \times 1.8\,R_\mathrm{h}
\langle \sigma_\mathrm{los}^2 \rangle G^{-1}$, where by $R_\mathrm{h}$ we
denote the projected half-light radius and by $\langle \sigma_\mathrm{los}^2
\rangle$ the luminosity-averaged squared line-of-sight velocity dispersion.
Tests against controlled simulations show that this estimator provides unbiased
enclosed masses with an accuracy of $\sim 10$ per cent. This confirms the
robustness of similar previously proposed mass estimators. Application to
published kinematic data of Milky Way dSphs reveals a tight correlation between
enclosed mass and luminosity. Using $N$-body models we show that tidal
stripping has little effect on this relation. Comparison against cuspy and
cored dark matter haloes extracted from controlled re-simulations of the
Aquarius A2 merger tree shows that the high mass densities of ultrafaint
galaxies are not compatible with large dark matter cores, and that the (total)
halo masses of the classical Milky Way dSphs span a remarkably narrow range ($8
\lesssim \mathrm{log_{10}}\,(M/\mathrm{M_\odot}) \lesssim 10$) at present,
showing no clear trend with either galaxy size or luminosity.

quasilocalized resonances and their effect on the chiral anomaly is unknown. We
numerically show that these resonant states do not affect the chiral anomaly
only in the case of a single Weyl node. At energies away from the Weyl point,
or with strong disorder where one is deep in the diffusive regime, the chiral
Landau level itself is not well defined and the semiclassical treatment is not
justified. In this limit, we analytically use the supersymmetry method and find
that the Chern-Simons term in the effective action which is not present in
nontopological systems gives rise to a nonzero average level velocity which
implies chiral charge pumping. We numerically establish that the nonzero
average level velocity serves as an indicator of the chiral anomaly in the

has been here completed with a central bar, a new bulge description, new disk
vertical profiles and several new bolometric corrections. The model can
generate synthetic mock catalogs of visible portions of the Milky Way (MW),
external galaxies like M31, or N-body simulation initial conditions. At any
given time, e.g., a chosen age of the Galaxy, the model contains a sum of
discrete stellar populations, namely bulge/bar, disk, halo. These populations
are in turn the sum of different components: the disk is the sum of spiral
arms, thin disks, a thick disk, and various gas components, while the halo is
the sum of a stellar component, a hot coronal gas, and a dark matter component.
The Galactic potential is computed from these population density profiles and
used to generate detailed kinematics by considering up to the first four
moments of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. The same density profiles are
then used to define the observed color-magnitude diagrams in a user-defined
field of view from an arbitrary solar location. Several photometric systems
have been included and made available on-line and no limits on the size of the
field of view are imposed thus allowing full sky simulations, too. Finally, we
model the extinction adopting a dust model with advanced ray-tracing solutions.

compared these results to scaling relations derived from virialized clusters,
finding significant offsets of up to 3-4$\sigma$ for some clusters, which could

of the clusters correlated with these offsets by performing a set of tests of
virialization and substructure on our sample, including Dressler-Schectman
tests, power ratios, analyses of the velocity distributions of galaxy
populations, and centroiding differences. For comparison to a wide range of
studies, we used two sets of tests: ones that did and did not use spectral
energy distribution fitting to obtain rest-frame colours, stellar masses, and
photometric redshifts of galaxies. Our results indicated that the difference
between the stellar mass or light mean-weighted center and the X-ray center, as

other cluster centroids had the strongest correlations with scaling relation
offsets, implying they are the most robust indicators of cluster virialization

for sources with NB921 < 23.5 and z' - NB921 > 1.3. This corresponds to a

one low-redshift ([OIII]5007) galaxy. The five ultraluminous LAEs have wider
line profiles than lower luminosity LAEs, and one source, NEPLA4, has a complex
line profile similar to that of COLA1. In combination with previous results, we
show that the line profiles of the z=6.6 ultraluminous LAEs are systematically
different than those of lower luminosity LAEs at this redshift. This result
suggests that ultraluminous LAEs generate highly ionized regions of the
intergalactic medium in their vicinity that allow the full Lyman alpha profile
of the galaxy---including any blue wings---to be visible. If this
interpretation is correct, then ultraluminous LAEs offer a unique opportunity
to determine the properties of the ionized zones around them, which will help
in understanding the ionization of the z ~ 7 intergalactic medium. A simple

ionizing photons, but more sophisticated calculations are needed to fully

2017 with the appearance of the Jupiter family comet 41P/TGK. We performed an
observational campaign with the TRAPPIST telescopes that covered almost the
entire period of time when the comet was active. In this work we present a
comprehensive study of the evolution of the dust environment of 41P based on
observational data from January to July, 2017. Also, we performed numerical
simulations to constrain its origin and dynamical nature. To model the
observational data set we used a Monte Carlo dust tail model, which allowed us
to derive the dust parameters that best describe its dust environment as a
function of heliocentric distance. In order to study its dynamical evolution,
we completed several experiments to evaluate the degree of stability of its
orbit, its life time in its current region close to Earth, and its future
behaviour. From the dust analysis, we found that comet 41P has a complex
emission pattern that shifted from full isotropic to anisotropic ejection
sometime during February 24-March 14 in 2017, and then from anisotropic to full
isotropic again between June 7-28. During the anisotropic period, the emission
was controlled by two strongly active areas, where one was located in the
southern and one in the northern hemisphere of the nucleus. The total dust mass
loss is estimated to be $\sim7.5\times10^{8}$ kg. From the dynamical
simulations we estimate that $\sim$3600 yr is the period of time during which
41P will remain in a similar orbit. Taking into account the estimated mass loss
per orbit, after 3600 yr, the nucleus may lose about 30$\%$ of its mass.
However, based on its observed dust-to-water mass ratio and its propensity to
outbursts, the lifetime of this comet could be much shorter.

the polarization properties change at distinct frequency bands. Our goal is to
discern the main mechanism responsible for the polarization through comparison

polarization observations at 97.5 GHz, 233 GHz and 343.5 GHz. The target is the
Class I object BHB07-11, which is the youngest object in the Barnard 59
protocluster. Complementary VLA observations at 34.5 GHz revealed a binary
system within the disk. We detect an extended and structured polarization
pattern remarkably consistent among all three bands. The distribution of
polarized intensity resembles a horseshoe shape with polarization angles
following this morphology. From the spectral index between bands 3 and 7, we
derive a dust opacity index $\beta \sim 1$ consistent with maximum grain sizes
larger than expected to produce self-scattering polarization in each band. The
polarization morphology do not match predictions from self-scattering. On the
other hand, marginal correspondence is seen between our maps and predictions
from radiation field assuming the brightest binary component as main radiation
source. Molecular line data from BHB07-11 indicates disk rotation. We produced
synthetic polarization maps from a rotating magnetized disk model assuming
combined poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components. The magnetic field
vectors (i. e., the polarization vectors rotated by 90$\degr$) are better
represented by a model with poloidal magnetic field strength about 3 times the
toroidal one. The similarity of our polarization patterns among the three bands
provides a strong evidence against self-scattering and radiation fields. On the

proposed method uses an A0\,V star or its analog as a standard star from which
on the order of 100 intrinsic stellar lines are carefully removed with the help
of a reference synthetic telluric spectrum. We find that this method can also
be applied to feature-rich objects having spectra with heavily blended
intrinsic stellar and telluric lines and present an application to a G-type
giant using this approach. We also develop a new diagnostic method for
evaluating the accuracy of telluric correction and use it to demonstrate that
our method achieves an accuracy better than 2\% for spectral parts for which
the atmospheric transmittance is as low as $\sim$20\% if telluric standard
stars are observed under the following conditions: (1) the difference in
airmass between the target and the standard is $\lesssim 0.05$; and (2) that in
time is less than 1 h. In particular, the time variability of water vapor has a
large impact on the accuracy of telluric correction and minimizing the
difference in time from that of the telluric standard star is important
especially in near-infrared high-resolution spectroscopic observation.

types of cancer in which patients suffer from a moderate-to-severe neuropathy,
neural damage and a distorted quality of life. Here we aim to examine the
expression profiles of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and of
transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and to assess the possible
therapeutic strategies through blockade of transient receptor potential (TRP)
channels. Methods: Cancer was induced within the sciatic nerves of male
Copenhagen rats, and tissues from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were collected and
used for measurements of immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The TRPV1
antagonist capsazepine, the selective TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 and the
calcium ions inhibitor ruthenium red were used to treat thermal and/or
mechanical hyperalgesia. Results: Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1
showed a lower expression in DRGs on days 7 and 14. The expression of TRPV4,
TLR4 and ERK1/2 showed an increase on day 3 then a decrease on days 7 and 14.
TRPV1 and TLR4 as well as TRPV4 and ERK1/2 co-existed on the same neuronal
cells. The neuropathic pain was reversed in dose-dependent manners by using the
TRP antagonists and the calcium ions inhibitor. Conclusion: The decreased
expression of TRPV1 and TRPV4 is associated with high activation. The increased
expression of TLR4 and ERK1/2 reveals earlier immune response and tumor
progression, respectively, and their ultimate decrease is an indicator of nerve
damage. We studied the possible role of TRPV1 and TRPV4 in transducing
cancer-induced hyperalgesia. The possible treatment strategies of
cancer-induced thermal and/or mechanical hyperalgesia using capsazepine,
HC-067047 and ruthenium red are examined.

simultaneously from the simulation (determining, for each stellar model, the

are well modelled by pure exponential disks. The rest of the galaxies were
fitted with two components: a Sersic bulge and an exponential disk. Most of
these galaxies have bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio less than 0.1. However, of these
104 galaxies, $20\%$ have $B/T > 0.1$ i.e., hosting significant bulge component

colour criteria, most of the LSB galaxies in our sample are blue, with only 7
classified as red LSBs. About $15\%$ of the LSB galaxies (including both blue

is proposed that replaces the Linear Extended state observer (LESO) used in
Conventional ADRC (C-ADRC) with a Nested LESO. In the nested LESO, the
inner-loop LESO actively estimates and eliminates the generalized disturbance.
Increasing the bandwidth improves the estimation accuracy which may tolerate
noise and conflict with H/W limitations and the sampling frequency of the
system. Therefore, an alternative scenario is offered without increasing the
bandwidth of the inner-loop LESO provided that the rate of change of the
generalized disturbance estimation error is upper bounded. This is achieved by
the placing an outer-loop LESO in parallel with the inner one, it estimates and
eliminates the remaining generalized disturbance that eluded from the
inner-loop LESO due to bandwidth limitations. The stability of LESO and nested
LESO is investigated using Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulations on
uncertain nonlinear SISO system with time-varying exogenous disturbance
revealed that the proposed nested LESO can successfully deal with a generalized
disturbance in both noisy and noise-free environments, where the Integral Time
Absolute Error (ITAE) of the tracking error for the nested LESO is reduced by
69.87% from that of the LESO.

efficiency/quality compromise between using the entire 6 degree of freedom pose
space and using a single view hemisphere to select the views.
  Our results show that, in contrast to existing ""explore and exploit"" methods

improved by adding a third set. They also indicate that three rounds of data
collection is sufficient even for very complex scenes. We compare our algorithm

characterize in an accurate way the cluster as well as its evolved stars, for
which we derive for the first time atmospheric parameters and chemical
abundances. We identify 126 B-type likely members within a radius of
2.7$\pm$0.6 arcmin, which implies an initial mass, $M_{cl}\approx$4100
M$_{\odot}$. We find a distance of 7.2$\pm$0.7 kpc for NGC 3105, placing it at
$R_{GC}$=10.0$\pm$1.2 kpc. Isochrone fitting supports an age of 28$\pm$6 Ma,
implying masses around 9.5 M$_{\odot}$ for the supergiants. A high fraction of
Be stars ($\approx$25 %) is found at the top of the main sequence down to
spectral type b3. From the spectral analysis we estimate for the cluster a
$v_{rad}$=+46.9$\pm$0.9 km s$^{-1}$ and a low metallicity,
[Fe/H]=-0.29$\pm$0.22. We also have determined, for the first time, chemical
abundances for Li, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni, Rb, Y, and Ba for the evolved

Galactic thin disc. An overabundance of Ba is found, supporting the enhanced
$s$-process. NGC 3105 has a low metallicity for its Galactocentric distance,
comparable to typical LMC stars. It is a valuable spiral tracer in a very
distant region of the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm, a poorly known part of the
Galaxy. As one of the few Galactic clusters containing blue, yellow and red
supergiants, it is massive enough to serve as a testbed for theoretical
evolutionary models close to the boundary between intermediate and high-mass

considering the continual removal of short range information in a boundary
state. It thus provides a natural interpretation as the bulk dual of a series
of coarse-grained holographic states. The slice possesses many desirable
properties that provide consistency checks for its boundary interpretation.
These include monotonicity of both area and entanglement entropy, uniqueness,
and the inability to probe beyond late-time black hole horizons. Additionally,
the holographic slice illuminates physics behind entanglement shadows, as
minimal area extremal surfaces anchored to a coarse-grained boundary may probe
entanglement shadows. This lets the slice flow through shadows. To aid in
developing intuition for these slices, many explicit examples of holographic
slices are investigated. Finally, the relationship to tensor networks and
renormalization (particularly in AdS/CFT) is discussed.

Compared to popular random sampling approaches, OEDIPUS is fully deterministic

from a mathematical viewpoint. A main technique to theoretically understand
early-warning signs for tipping points is to use the framework of fast-slow
stochastic differential equations. A key assumption in many arguments for the
existence of variance and auto-correlation growth before a tipping point is to
use a linearization argument, i.e., the leading-order term governing the
deterministic (or drift) part of stochastic differential equation is linear.
This assumption guarantees a local approximation via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process in the normally hyperbolic regime before, but sufficiently bounded away
from, a bifurcation. In this paper, we generalize the situation to
leading-order nonlinear terms for the setting of one fast variable. We work in
the quasi-steady regime and prove that the fast variable has a well-defined
stationary distribution and we calculate the scaling law for the variance as a
bifurcation-induced tipping point is approached. We cross-validate the scaling
law numerically. Furthermore, we provide a computational study for the
predictability using early-warning signs for leading-order nonlinear terms

monitored as a function of size (1.3-3.1 nm) and shape (octahedron,

forced to fit the quantum TDDFT at 3.1nm, at smaller sizes there is a
significant deviation as the classical theory is unable to account for peak

attribute the failure of classical methods at predicting these features to
quantum effects and low density of states in small nanoparticles. Classically,

the thinness of the cleansed shell of gas and by turbulence in the cloud, why
the mechanism can hardly be important in cleansing masses corresponding to rich

experimentally measuring receptor responses to a representative set of complex

challenge, we develop a biophysical model that predicts mammalian receptor
responses to complex mixtures using responses to single odorants. The dominant
nonlinearity in our model is competitive binding (CB): only one odorant

predicts receptor responses to mixtures of up to twelve monomolecular odorants
to within 15\% of experimental observations and provides a powerful method for
leveraging limited experimental data. Simple extensions of our model describe

the presence of such interactions can be identified via systematic deviations

transport properties of h-BN, which can be critical for device reliability and

primary challenge in the experimental measurements of the anisotropic thermal

too small for conventional measurement techniques, as state-of-the-art
technologies synthesize h-BN single crystals with lateral sizes only up to 2.5

thermoreflectance (TDTR) techniques are suitable to measure the anisotropic
thermal conductivity of such small samples, as it only requires a small area of
50x50 {\mu}m2 for the measurements. Accurate atomistic modeling of thermal
transport in bulk h-BN is also challenging due to the highly anisotropic
layered structure. Here we conduct an integrated experimental and theoretical
study on the anisotropic thermal conductivity of bulk h-BN single crystals over
the temperature range of 100 K to 500 K, using TDTR measurements with multiple
modulation frequencies and a full-scale numerical calculation of the phonon
Boltzmann transport equation starting from the first principles. Our
experimental and numerical results compare favorably for both the in-plane and
through-plane thermal conductivities. We observe unusual temperature-dependence

of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of h-BN but also develops fundamental

for the inverse seesaw mechanism and four additional chiral fermions introduced
in this model. After spontaneous symmetry breaking the four chiral fermionic
degrees of freedom combine to give two Dirac states. The lightest Dirac fermion
becomes stable and hence the dark matter candidate. We focus on the region of

the Random Type Poisson Arrival Model. Just like in the known i.i.d. model
(introduced by Feldman et al. 2009), online nodes have types in our model. In
contrast to the adversarial types studied in the known i.i.d. model, following
the random graphs studied in Mastin and Jaillet 2016, in our model each type
graph is generated randomly by including each offline node in the neighborhood
of an online node with probability $c/n$ independently. In our model, nodes of
the same type appear consecutively in the input and the number of times each
type node appears is distributed according to the Poisson distribution with
parameter 1. We analyze the performance of the simple greedy algorithm under
this input model. The performance is controlled by the parameter $c$ and we are
able to exactly characterize the competitive ratio for the regimes $c = o(1)$
and $c = \omega(1)$. We also provide a precise bound on the expected size of
the matching in the remaining regime of constant $c$. We compare our results to
the previous work of Mastin and Jaillet who analyzed the simple greedy
algorithm in the $G_{n,n,p}$ model where each online node type occurs exactly
once. We essentially show that the approach of Mastin and Jaillet can be
extended to work for the Random Type Poisson Arrival Model, although several
nontrivial technical challenges need to be overcome. Intuitively, one can view
the Random Type Poisson Arrival Model as the $G_{n,n,p}$ model with less
randomness; that is, instead of each online node having a new type, each online
node has a chance of repeating the previous type.

the iron K-shell lines are the most prominent features in the X-ray reflected
spectrum. Their line profiles can be grossly broadened and skewed by Doppler
effects and gravitational redshift. Consequently, modeling the reflection
spectrum provides one of the best methods to measure, among other physical
quantities, the black-hole spin. At present the accuracy of the spin estimates
is called into question because the data fits require very high iron
abundances: typically several times the solar value. Concurrently no plausible
physical explanation has been proffered for these black-hole systems to be so
iron rich. The most likely explanation for the supersolar iron abundances is
model shortfall at very high densities ($>10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$) due to atomic
data shortcomings in this regime. We review the current observational evidence

star-forming galaxies (SFGs) above and below the ridge of the star-forming main
sequence (SFMS), transition galaxies and quiescent galaxies. We study their

have flat sSFR profiles, whereas the transition galaxies at the same masses
generally have sSFRs that are more suppressed in their outskirts. In contrast,
at high masses ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$), SFGs above and below the SFMS
ridge and transition galaxies generally have varying degrees of more
centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts. These findings indicate
that at $z\sim~0.5-1.0$ the main galaxy quenching mode depends on its already
formed stellar mass, exhibiting a transition from ""the outside-in"" at $M_{\ast}

jointly learns the background and speaker models by creating the representation

We study the continued cooling of the neutron star crust in this system that
was heated during the 2010 outburst of the source. This new observation was
performed two years after the last observation of IGR J17480-2446, hence,
significantly extending the cooling baseline. We reanalysed all available
Chandra observations of the source (but excluding observations during which one
of the known transients in Terzan 5 was in outburst) and fitted the obtained
cooling curve with our cooling code NSCool, which allows for much improved
modelling than what was previously performed for the source. The data and our
fit models indicate that the crust was still cooling ~5.5 years after the
outburst ended. The neutron star crust has likely not reached crust-core
thermal equilibrium yet, and further cooling is predicted (which can be
confirmed with additional Chandra observations in >5 years). Intriguingly, we
find indications that the thermal conductivity might be relatively low in part
of the crust compared to what has been inferred for other crust-cooling sources
and tentatively suggest that this layer might be located around the neutron
drip. The reason for this difference is unclear, but might be related to the
fact that IGR J17480-2446 harbours a relatively slowly rotating neutron star
(with a spin of 11 Hz) that has a relatively strong inferred surface magnetic
field ($10^{9-10}$ Gauss) compared to what is known or typically assumed for

  Bounded Neural Network",,,"10.1145/3210445.3210446",,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rate control is widely adopted during video streaming to provide both high
video qualities and low latency under various network conditions. However,
despite that many work have been proposed, they fail to tackle one major
problem: previous methods determine a future transmission rate as a single for
value which will be used in an entire time-slot, while real-world network
conditions, unlike lab setup, often suffer from rapid and stochastic changes,
resulting in the failures of predictions.
  In this paper, we propose a delay-constrained rate control approach based on
end-to-end deep learning. The proposed model predicts future bit rate not as a
single value, but as possible bit rate ranges using target delay gradient, with
which the transmission delay is guaranteed. We collect a large scale of
real-world live streaming data to train our model, and as a result, it
automatically learns the correlation between throughput and target delay
gradient. We build a testbed to evaluate our approach. Compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates a better performance in
bandwidth utilization. In all considered scenarios, a range based rate control
approach outperforms the one without range by 19% to 35% in average QoE
improvement.

challenging problem to address, even more so in the presence of dissipation as
the symptoms of disorder-induced localization are very closely simulated by the
absorption in a system. Following up on recent experimental studies, we
numerically study the occurrence of Anderson localization in plasmonic systems
at terahertz frequencies. The low losses in the material at these frequencies
allow us to separately quantify the localization length and the loss length in
the system. We measure a non-monotonic variation of loss length as a function
of disorder, and attribute it to the participation ratio of the localized modes
and resulting light occupancy in the metal. Next, we identify a unique behavior
of the gap state frequencies and the density of states under disorder. We
observe that the maximally displaced gap state frequencies have a propensity to
remain pinned to the frequency of the gap center. Even under strong disorder,
the gap does not close, and density of states profile continues to remain
peaked in the gap, unlike in conventionally studied disordered systems. The
origins of this behavior are traced to the nature of the quasiparticle
dispersion. In our case, the quasiparticles are identified to be hybrid
plasmons generated due to the hybridization of surface plasmon polaritons at a
metal-dielectric interface and cavity resonances at sub-wavelength apertures
thereon. This situation is akin to the Kondo systems, where dispersive
conduction electrons hybridise with a localized impurity state opening a
hybridization gap. Our results provide new insights on the elusive problem of
the interplay of loss and localization, and underlines interesting physics at
the hybridisation gap in hybrid plasmonic systems.

spatio-temporal impulse using the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. The
impulse is introduced as an external body force in incompressible channel flow
at $Re_\tau=10000$. Velocity fluctuations are defined about the turbulent mean
velocity profile. A turbulent eddy viscosity is added to the equations to fix
the mean velocity as an exact solution, which also serves to model the
dissipative effects of the background turbulence on large-scale fluctuations.
An impulsive body force produces flowfields that evolve into coherent
structures containing long streamwise velocity streaks that are flanked by
quasi-streamwise vortices; some of these impulses produce hairpin vortices. As
these vortex-streak structures evolve, they grow in size to be nominally
self-similar geometrically with an aspect ratio (streamwise to wall-normal) of
approximately $10$, while their kinetic energy density decays monotonically.
The topology of the vortex-streak structures is not sensitive to the location
of the impulse, but is dependent on the direction of the impulsive body force.
All of these vortex-streak structures are attached to the wall, and their
Reynolds stresses collapse when scaled by distance from the wall, consistent
with Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis.

approach to Bayesian inference for general state models; it is an alternative
to Markov chain Monte Carlo. When applied to state space models, it moves a
collection of parameters and latent states (which are called particles) through
a number of stages, with each stage having its own target distribution. The
particles are initially generated from a distribution that is easy to sample
from, e.g. the prior; the target at the final stage is the posterior
distribution. Tempering is usually carried out either in batch mode, involving
all the data at each stage, or sequentially with observations added at each
stage, which is called data tempering. Our paper proposes efficient Markov
moves for generating the parameters and states for each stage of particle based
density tempering. This allows the proposed SMC methods to increase (scale up)
the number of parameters and states that can be handled. Most of the current
literature uses a pseudo-marginal Markov move step with the states integrated
out, and the parameters generated by a random walk proposal; although this
strategy is general, it is very inefficient when the states or parameters are
high dimensional. We also build on the work of Dufays (2016) and make data
tempering more robust to outliers and structural changes for models with
intractable likelihoods by adding batch tempering at each stage. The
performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using univariate stochastic
volatility models with outliers and structural breaks and high dimensional
factor stochastic volatility models having both many parameters and many latent
states.

to a fixed pseudovariety. While it is known that there exist pseudovarieties
with NP-complete or even undecidable membership problems, for many well-known
pseudovarieties the problem is known to be decidable in polynomial time. We
show that for many of these pseudovarieties, the membership problem is actually
in AC^0. To this end, we show that these pseudovarieties can be characterized
by first-order sentences with multiplication as the only predicate. We prove
closure properties of the class of pseudovarieties with such first-order
descriptions under various well-known operations; in particular, if V can be
described by a first-order sentence, then DV, LV, and the Mal'cev products of
K, D, N, LI, and LG with V are first-order definable as well. Moreover, if H is
a first-order definable pseudovariety of finite groups, then the pseudovariety
of all finite semigroups whose subgroups are in H is first-order definable. Our
formalism is also powerful enough to capture all pseudovarieties characterized
by finite sets of omega-identities. In view of lower bounds from circuit
complexity, we obtain a new technique to prove that a pseudovariety V cannot be
defined by such a set: if membership in V is hard for PARITY, it cannot be
defined in this logic and thus cannot be described by finitely many

nanofocused (i.e. both field enhanced and wavelength compressed) by propagation
along a vertical taper. Via numerical simulations, we demonstrate that field
enhancement factors of 90, for steep tapers, and wavelength compression of more
than an order of magnitude for adiabatic tapers, can be expected. Employing
scatteringtype scanning near field optical microscopy ,s SNOM, we provide for
the first time proof of principle experimental evidence of a significant HPP
wavelength compression. We expect these functionalities to provide diverse
applications, from biosensing and non-linear optics to optical circuitry.

evaluable functions that extends their application to sets of objects,
something that allows a fully logical treatment of aggregates. Formally, we
start from the syntax of First Order Logic with equality and the semantics of
Quantified Equilibrium Logic with evaluable functions (QELF). Then, we proceed
to incorporate a new kind of logical term, intensional set (a construct
commonly used to denote the set of objects characterised by a given formula),
and to extend QELF semantics for this new type of expression. In our extended
approach, intensional sets can be arbitrarily used as predicate or function
arguments or even nested inside other intensional sets, just as regular
first-order logical terms. As a result, aggregates can be naturally formed by
the application of some evaluable function (count, sum, maximum, etc) to a set
of objects expressed as an intensional set. This approach has several
advantages. First, while other semantics for aggregates depend on some
syntactic transformation (either via a reduct or a formula translation), the
QELF interpretation treats them as regular evaluable functions, providing a
compositional semantics and avoiding any kind of syntactic restriction. Second,
aggregates can be explicitly defined now within the logical language by the
simple addition of formulas that fix their meaning in terms of multiple
applications of some (commutative and associative) binary operation. For
instance, we can use recursive rules to define sum in terms of integer
addition. Last, but not least, we prove that the semantics we obtain for
aggregates coincides with the one defined by Gelfond and Zhang for the Alog
language, when we restrict to that syntactic fragment. (Under consideration for
acceptance in TPLP)

designer to reduce the slit width of the spectrograph, increasing spectral
resolving power whilst retaining throughput. Conventionally this is done using
bulk optics, such as mirrors and prisms, however more recently astrophotonic
components known as photonic lanterns (PLs) and photonic reformatters have also
been used. These devices reformat the multi-mode (MM) input light from a
telescope into single-mode (SM) outputs, which can then be re-arranged to suit
the spectrograph. The photonic dicer (PD) is one such device, designed to
reduce the dependence of spectrograph size on telescope aperture and eliminate
modal noise. We simulate the PD, by optimising the throughput and geometrical
design using Soapy and BeamProp. The simulated device shows a transmission
between 8 and 20 %, depending upon the type of adaptive optics (AO) correction
applied, matching the experimental results well. We also investigate our
idealised model of the PD and show that the barycentre of the slit varies only
slightly with time, meaning that the modal noise contribution is very low when
compared to conventional fibre systems. We further optimise our model device
for both higher throughput and reduced modal noise. This device improves
throughput by 6.4 % and reduces the movement of the slit output by 50%, further
improving stability. This shows the importance of properly simulating such
devices, including atmospheric effects. Our work complements recent work in the
field and is essential for optimising future photonic reformatters.

result in a nematic phase transition, whose temperature seems to coincide with
the onset temperature of the pseudogap state $T^*$ around optimal doping level,
raising the question whether the pseudogap results from the establishment of
the nematic order. Here we report results of resistivity measurements under
uniaxial pressure on several hole-doped cuprates, where the normalized slope of
the elastoresistivity $\zeta$ can be obtained as illustrated in iron-based
superconductors. The temperature dependence of $\zeta$ along particular lattice
axis exhibits kink feature at $T_{k}$ and shows Curie-Weiss-like behavior above
it, which may suggest a spontaneous nematic transition. While $T_{k}$ seems to
be the same as $T^*$ around the optimal doping and in the overdoped region,
they become very different in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$. Our results
suggest that the nematic order, if indeed existing, is an electronic phase

importance. In this paper, we formulate the optimal power flow (OPF) with

in the network are usually 'non-Gaussian' distributed random variables, the
chance constraints cannot be directly converted to deterministic constraints.
Therefore, in this paper we use the recently-developed approach of inner-outer

effectiveness of the approach is shown using DC OPF incorporating uncertain

industrial or nuclear power plant during an earthquake event is a very
difficult task since the dynamic behaviour of the tank-liquid system is highly
complex. The seismic response of steel storage tanks is quite different from
building structures not only due to hydrodynamic effects acting on the shell
and bottom plate but also because of many sources of nonlinear behaviour
mechanisms. For the earthquake-resistant design of tanks, it is important to
use a rational and reliable nonlinear dynamic analysis procedure, which is
capable of capturing the seismic behaviour of the tanks under artificial or
real earthquakes. The present paper deals with the nonlinear finite element
modelling of steel storage tanks subjected to seismic loadings. The interaction
effects of fluid and structure are modelled using a surface-based
acoustic-structural interaction in the ABAQUS software. The successive contact
and separation between the bottom plate and its rigid foundation caused by
sliding and uplift are taken into account by a contact modelling approach.
Reduced scales of both slender and broad cylindrical steel storage tanks from a
shaking table campaign within the framework of the INDUSE-2-SAFETY project are
selected for the study. The seismic responses of the tanks including the
hydrodynamic pressure distribution acting on the shell plate, the elevation of
the liquid free surface, and the uplift response of the bottom plate when the
tank is unanchored are presented and compared with the experimental results.
The responses obtained from the refined models are also compared with those
obtained using a simplified approach, which is based on the lumped mass model
of the liquid motion.

of an intrinsic antiferromagnetism above the Tc of (Li, Fe)OHFeSe

(Li, Fe)OHFeSe single crystal samples with Tc up to ~41 K. We observe an
evident drop in the static magnetization at Tafm ~125 K, in some of the SC (Tc
< ~38 K, cell parameter c < ~9.27 {\AA}) and non-SC samples. We verify that
this AFM signal is intrinsic to (Li, Fe)OHFeSe. Thus, our observations indicate
mesoscopic-to-macroscopic coexistence of an AFM state with the normal (below
Tafm) or SC (below Tc) state in (Li, Fe)OHFeSe. We explain such coexistence by
electronic phase separation, similar to that in high-Tc cuprates and iron
arsenides. However, such an AFM signal can be absent in some other samples of
(Li, Fe)OHFeSe, particularly it is never observed in the SC samples of Tc > ~38
K, owing to a spatial scale of the phase separation too small for the
macroscopic magnetic probe. For this case, we propose a microscopic electronic
phase separation. It is suggested that the microscopic static phase separation
reaches vanishing point in high-Tc (Li, Fe)OHFeSe, by the occurrence of
two-dimensional AFM spin fluctuations below nearly the same temperature as Tafm
reported previously for a (Li, Fe)OHFeSe (Tc ~42 K) single crystal. A complete

there are several stages of auditory processing and transmission where
information may potentially get lost. In this paper, we aim at quantifying the
information loss in the human auditory system by using information theoretic
tools.
  To do so, we consider a speech communication model, where words are uttered
and sent through a noisy channel, and then received and processed by a human
listener.
  We define a notion of information loss that is related to the human word
recognition rate. To assess the word recognition rate of humans, we conduct a
closed-vocabulary intelligibility test. We derive upper and lower bounds on the
information loss. Simulations reveal that the bounds are tight and we observe
that the information loss in the human auditory system increases as the signal
to noise ratio (SNR) decreases. Our framework also allows us to study whether
humans are optimal in terms of speech perception in a noisy environment.
Towards that end, we derive optimal classifiers and compare the human and
machine performance in terms of information loss and word recognition rate. We
observe a higher information loss and lower word recognition rate for humans
compared to the optimal classifiers. In fact, depending on the SNR, the machine
classifier may outperform humans by as much as 8 dB. This implies that for the
speech-in-stationary-noise setup considered here, the human auditory system is
sub-optimal for recognizing noisy words.

Sources (RES) has severe (financial and other) implications for energy market

that captures the atomic (all available) flexibilities in energy demand and
provides the largest possible solution space to generate demand/supply
schedules that minimize market imbalances. We evaluate the effectiveness and
feasibility of widely used forecasting models for device-level flexibility
analysis. In a typical device-level flexibility forecast, a market player is
more concerned with the \textit{utility} that the demand flexibility brings to
the market, rather than the intrinsic forecast accuracy. In this regard, we
provide comprehensive predictive modeling and scheduling of demand flexibility
from household appliances to demonstrate the (financial and otherwise)
viability of introducing flexibility-based DR in the Danish/Nordic market.
Further, we investigate the correlation between the potential utility and the
accuracy of the demand forecast model. Furthermore, we perform a number of
experiments to determine the data granularity that provides the best financial
reward to market players for adopting the proposed DR scheme. A cost-benefit
analysis of forecast results shows that even with somewhat low forecast
accuracy, market players can achieve regulation cost savings of 54% of the

desirable to adapt the amount of smoothing locally to the variation of $f$. For

to be replaced by an adaptation function $\mu$. This function is matrix-valued
which allows for different degrees of smoothing in different directions. The
aim of this paper is twofold. The first is to provide a theoretical framework

many advantages, such as additional process routes and easier handling. So far,

demonstrates how core-shell CdSe/CdS quantum dot-in-rods can be transferred
into water using a ligand exchange method employing mercaptopropionic acid

diameter, which prevents potential surface defects formed during the ligand
exchange from affecting the photophysics of the dot-in-rods. Films made from
water-soluble dot-in-rods show amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with a
similar threshold (130 microJ/cm2) as the pristine material (115 microJ/cm2).
To demonstrate feasibility for lasing applications, self-assembled micro lasers
are fabricated via the coffee-ring effect that display single-mode operation
and a very low threshold of around 10 microJ/cm2. The performance of these
micro lasers is enhanced by the small size of MPA ligands, enabling a high

respectively maximize the secrecy rate (SR) with transmit power constraint and
minimize the transmit power of the BS with SR constraint, by optimizing
beamforming vector and artificial noise covariance matrix. To further reduce
the complexity of our proposed optimal schemes, their low-complexity (LC)

show that our proposed schemes, B-CJ-SRM and B-CJ-TPM, achieve significant SR

elliptic problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=1,2,3$. The first method, introduced by

$r_\alpha(t)$ of $t^{1-\alpha}$ for $0 \le t \le 1$, is used to get the
rational approximation of $t^{-\alpha}$ in the form $t^{-1}r_\alpha(t)$. Here
we develop another method, denoted by R-BURA, that is based on the best
rational approximation $r_{1-\alpha}(t)$ of $t^\alpha$ on the interval $[0,1]$
and approximates $t^{-\alpha}$ via $r^{-1}_{1-\alpha}(t)$. The third method,

convergent quadrature scheme for the Dundord-Taylor integral representation of
the fractional powers of elliptic operators. All three methods reduce the
solution of the system $\mathbb{A}^\alpha \bf{u}=\bf{f}$ to solving a number of
equations of the type $(\mathbb{A} +c\mathbb{I})\bf{u}= \bf{f}$, $c \ge 0$.
Comprehensive numerical experiments on model problems with $\mathbb A$ obtained
by approximation of elliptic equations in one and two spatial dimensions are
used to compare the efficiency of these three algorithms depending on the
fractional power $\alpha$. The presented results prove the concept of the new
R-BURA method, which performs well for $\alpha$ close to $1$ in contrast to
BURA, which performs well for $\alpha $ close to $0$. As a result, we show
theoretically and experimentally, that they have mutually complementary

weight per link, that limits the variability of the outcomes. In the present
article we propose an entropy-based randomisation of (bipartite) rating
networks by extending the Configuration Model framework: the randomised network
satisfies the constraints of the degree per rating, i.e. the number of given
ratings received by the specified product or assigned by the single user. We
first show that such a null model is able to reproduce several non-trivial
features of the real network better than other null models. Then, using it as a
benchmark, we project the information contained in the real system on one of
the layers, showing, for instance, the division in communities of music albums
due to the taste of customers, or, in movies due the audience.

Chapter 1, we start with a brief overview about fractional calculus and an
introduction to the theory of some special functions in fractional calculus.

definitions and some properties of the considered fractional derivatives and

parts formulas for different operators. Chapter 2 presents a short introduction
to the classical calculus of variations and review different variational
problems, like the isoperimetric problems or problems with variable endpoints.

of variations and some fractional variational problems with variable-order. In
the second part, we systematize some new recent results on variable-order
fractional calculus of (Tavares, Almeida and Torres, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018).

derivatives and prove upper bound formulas for the errors. In Chapter 4, we
introduce the combined Caputo fractional derivative of variable-order and
corresponding higher-order operators. Some properties are also given. Then, we
prove fractional Euler-Lagrange equations for several types of fractional

video segments and use the rest 422 for testing. This results in around 42,000
gesture frames sampled for training and 14,500 for testing. For a 6 split
experimentation, while the conventional approach reaches an Average Precision

take place under specific tasks, we focus on recognizing common gestures that
reoccur across different tasks and settings and significantly perform better

already available in the literature allowed us to cover a broad range in
wavelength (between 5348 and 8427 angstrom) and in effective temperatures
(between 3500 and 7700 K). This means the unique opportunity to cover both the
hottest and coolest phases along the Cepheid pulsation cycle and to limit the
intrinsic error on individual measurements at the level of ~100 K. Thanks to
the high signal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra we identified and measured
hundreds of neutral and ionized lines of heavy elements, and in turn, have the
opportunity to trace the variation of both surface gravity and microturbulent
velocity along the pulsation cycle. The accuracy of the physical parameters and
the number of Fe I (more than one hundred) and Fe II (more than ten) lines
measured allowed us to estimate mean iron abundances with a precision better
than 0.1 dex. Here we focus on 14 calibrating Cepheids for which the current
spectra cover either the entire or a significant portion of the pulsation
cycle. The current estimates of the variation of the physical parameters along
the pulsation cycle and of the iron abundances agree quite well with similar
estimates available in the literature. Independent homogeneous estimates of
both physical parameters and metal abundances based on different approaches
that can constrain possible systematics are highly encouraged.

its advantages and practicality in modeling of multi-domain systems and

a behavioral approach in its control design methodologies. Hence, it provides
solutions, which not only achieve the control objectives, but are also easily
interpretable in the standard engineering parlance. The fundamental idea in
passivity based control (PBC) methodologies is to find a controller that
renders the closed-loop system passive. It is well known that, the PBC
methodologies that rely on power-conjugate port-variables do not work for
control objectives that require bounded power and unbounded energy. This is
commonly known as the dissipation obstacle. One possible alternative that has
been well explored, in the case of finite dimensional systems, is Brayton-Moser

exploiting few-layer phosphorene, e.g., a 10 nm thick flake of exfoliated
crystalline black phosphorus (BP), as active channel of a field-effect

between insulating and conducting states and by engineering proper antennas for
efficient light harvesting, we reach detection performance comparable with
commercial detection technologies, providing the first technological

techniques allow multiple nodes of a wireless network to synthesize a common
secret-key, which can be subsequently used to keep their group messages
confidential. As one of its salient features, the wireless nodes involved in
physical-layer GSK generation extract randomness from a subset of their
wireless channels, referred as the common source of randomness (CSR). Unlike
two-user key generation, in GSK generation, some nodes must act as facilitators
by broadcasting quantized versions of the linear combinations of the channel
realizations, so as to assist all the nodes to observe a CSR. However, we note
that broadcasting linear combination of channel realizations incurs non-zero
leakage of the CSR to an eavesdropper, and moreover, quantizing the linear
combination also reduces the overall key-rate. Identifying these issues, we
propose a practical GSK generation protocol, referred to as Algebraic
Symmetrically Quantized GSK (A-SQGSK) protocol, in a network of three nodes,
wherein due to quantization of symbols at the facilitator, the other two nodes
also quantize their channel realizations, and use them appropriately over
algebraic rings to generate the keys. First, we prove that the A-SQGSK protocol
incurs zero leakage to an eavesdropper. Subsequently, on the CSR provided by
the A-SQGSK protocol, we propose a consensus algorithm among the three nodes,
called the Entropy-Maximization Error-Minimization (EM-EM) algorithm, which
maximizes the entropy of the secret-key subject to an upper-bound on the
mismatch-rate. We use extensive analysis and simulation results to lay out

investigation of specific sources seen through the Gaia eyes (e.g. known
variables or visually identified objects with peculiar features in their light

also benefited from supplementary ground-based photometric monitoring of a few
preliminary candidates, performed at the Flemish Mercator telescope (Canary
Islands, Spain) between August and November 2017. We publish a list of 3,018
short-timescale variable candidates, spread throughout the sky, with a
false-positive rate up to 10-20% in the Magellanic Clouds, and a more
significant but justifiable contamination from longer-period variables between
19% and 50%, depending on the area of the sky. Although its completeness is
limited to about 0.05%, this first sample of Gaia short-timescale variables
recovers some very interesting known short-period variables, such as
post-common envelope binaries or cataclysmic variables, and brings to light
some fascinating, newly discovered variable sources. In the perspective of
future Gaia data releases, several improvements of the short-timescale
variability processing are considered, by enhancing the existing variogram and
period-search algorithms or by classifying the identified candidates.
Nonetheless, the encouraging outcome of our Gaia DR2 analysis demonstrates the
power of this mission for such fast-variability studies, and opens great

tool to discover hidden factors in multiple time series data, and has been used
in many data mining applications including dimensionality reduction, principal

incremental SVD has been used to deal with multiple semi infinite time series

the multiple time series data analysis do not provide functionality for
detecting patterns of data in an arbitrary time range: standard SVD requires
data for all intervals corresponding to a time range query, and incremental SVD
does not consider an arbitrary time range. In this paper, we propose Zoom-SVD,
a fast and memory efficient method for finding latent factors of time series

time series data block by block to reduce the space cost in storage phase, and
efficiently computes singular value decomposition (SVD) for a given time range

Zoom-SVD is useful for capturing past time ranges whose patterns are similar to

self-propelled particles that exhibit velocity-alignment interactions with
neighbours within their field of view. The stochasticity in the dynamics of the
model arises purely from the uncertainties at the level of interactions.
Despite the absence of attractive forces, this model gives rise to a wide array
of emergent patterns that exhibit long-time spatial cohesion. In order to gain
further insights into the dynamical nature of the resulting patterns, we
investigate the system behaviour using an algorithm that identifies spatially
distinct clusters of the flock and computes their corresponding angular
momenta. Our results suggest that the choice of field of view is crucial in
determining the resulting emergent dynamics of stochastically interacting
particles.

key role in reproducing pathological chaotic dynamics such as ventricular
fibrillation during inflammatory events, for instance. The specific structure
of the governing equations suggests to cast the problem in mixed-primal form

electric potential, activation generation, and ionic variables. We also propose
a new mixed-primal finite element method for its numerical approximation, and

largescale nanoporous metallic network whose building-blocks are assembled into

results from the network structure having a large surface area on which the

hot-spots can be formed also in deeper focal plans of the metallic network, and
thus can give rise to coherent addition of the signal. The solid connectivity
between the nanoscale building-blocks also plays a role, because it forms a
robust network which may respond in a collective manner to form very intense
hot-spots. Broadband responses of the metallic network are observed both by SHG

classical free Maxwell system in the transverse gauge in terms of complex

with its Poincar\'{e} symmetry. In particular, we show that the constant of
motion corresponding to the total angular momentum ${\bf J}$ naturally splits
into an `orbital' part ${\bf L}$ and a `spin' part ${\bf S}$ each of which is a
constant of motion in its own right. We then proceed to discuss quantization of
the free Maxwell system and construct the operators generating the Poincar\'{e}
group in the quantum context and analyze their algebraic properties and find
that while the quantum counterparts $\hat{{\bf L}}$ and $\hat{{\bf S}}$ of
${\bf L}$ and ${\bf S}$ go over into bona fide observables, they fail to
satisfy the angular momentum algebra precluding the possibility of their
interpretation as `orbital' and `spin' operators at the classical level. On the

angular momentum algebra and together with $\hat{{\bf S}}$ generates the group
$E(3)$. We then present an analysis of single photon states, paraxial
quantization both in the scalar as well as vector cases, single photon states
in the paraxial regime. All along a close connection is maintained with the

Bar-Joseph (1998), showing that any consensus algorithm that is resilient
against a linear number of crash faults requires $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt{n})$
rounds in an $n$-node network against an adaptive adversary, we consider a late
adaptive adversary, who has full knowledge of the network state at the
beginning of the previous round and unlimited computational power, but is
oblivious to the current state of the nodes.
  Our main contributions are randomized distributed algorithms that achieve
almost-everywhere consensus w.h.p. against a late adaptive adversary who can
block up to $\epsilon n$ nodes in each round, for a small constant $\epsilon
>0$. Our first protocol achieves binary and plurality consensus, and the second
one achieves multi-value consensus. Both of our algorithms succeed in $O(\log
n)$ rounds with high probability, thus showing an exponential gap to the
aforementioned lower bound for strongly adaptive crash-failure adversaries,
which can be strengthened to $\Omega(n)$ when allowing the adversary to block
nodes instead of permanently crashing them. In our algorithms each node
contacts only an (amortized) constant number of peers in each communication
round. We show that our algorithms are optimal up to constant (resp.
sub-logarithmic) factors by proving that every almost-everywhere consensus
protocol takes $\Omega(\log_d n)$ rounds in the worst case, where $d$ is an
upper bound on the number of communication requests initiated per node in each

It is inherently subjective: different users may prefer different clusterings
for a particular dataset. Semi-supervised clustering addresses this by allowing
the user to provide examples of instances that should (not) be in the same

series. We show that COBRAS, a state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering
method, can be adapted to this setting. We refer to this approach as COBRAS-TS.
An extensive experimental evaluation supports the following claims: (1)
COBRAS-TS far outperforms the current state of the art in semi-supervised
clustering for time series, and thus presents a new baseline for the field; (2)
COBRAS-TS can identify clusters with separated components; (3) COBRAS-TS can
identify clusters that are characterized by small local patterns; (4) a small

cornerstones of quantum mechanics. Aside from their fundamental significance,
they play an important role in practical applications, such as detection of
quantum correlations and security requirements in quantum cryptography. In
continuous variable systems, the spectra of the relevant observables form a
continnuum and this necessitates the coarse graining of measurements. However,
these coarse-grained observables do not necessarily obey the same uncertainty
relations as the original ones, a fact that can lead to false results when
considering applications. That is, one cannot naively replace the original
observables in the uncertainty relation for the coarse-grained observables and
expect consistent results. As such, a number of uncertainty relations that are
specifically designed for coarse-grained observables have been developed. In
recognition of the 90$^{th}$ anniversary of the seminal Heisenberg uncertainty
relation, celebrated last year, and all the subsequent work since then, here we
give a review of the state of the art of coarse-grained uncertainty relations

fundamental quantum physics and quantum information tasks. Our review is meant

provide possible explanation for its extreme evolutionary status. The results
show that the primary component of the system is of A8 spectral type, has a
mass of 1.6 M_sun, and a radius of 2 R_sun. It is a relatively fast pulsator

orbital period belongs also to the group of R CMa stars. If confirmed by radial
velocity data of the secondary component, the system would have the lowest mass
ratio that has ever been found in semi-detached systems and it can be

retrograde modes with $(\ell, m) = (1, -1)$ and $(2, -1)$ period spacing
patterns and one distinct prograde $(2,2)$ mode. The modelling resulted in a
stellar mass $M_{\star} = 5.8^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, a central
hydrogen mass fraction $X_c = 0.54^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, and exponential convective
core overshooting parameter $f_{\rm ov} = 0.004^{+0.014}_{-0.002}$. The low
value for $f_{\rm ov}$ is compatible with the suppression of near-core mixing
due to a magnetic field but the uncertainties are too large to pinpoint such
suppression as the sole physical interpretation. $[...]$

other individuals adopt the behavior more easily. Specifically, the existence
of opinion leaders reduces the lowest mean degree of the network required for
the global behavior adoption, and increases the highest mean degree of the
network that the global behavior adoption can occur. Besides, the introduction
of opinion leaders accelerates the behavior adoption, but does not change the
adoption order of individuals. The developed theoretical predictions agree with
the simulation results. Second, we randomly choose the opinion leaders from the

reliably computing these Lyapunov quantities requires robust nu- merical

of this work is two-fold: a) develop a robust algorithm for obtaining Lyapunov

quantify the spatial and temporal convergence properties of this algorithm
using a series of progressively complex flow problems. In particular, a manu-

perturbation theory to extract Lyapunov exponents and vectors from OS eigen
solutions. While individual test cases show interesting results, overall the
spatial convergence rates of Lyapunov exponents follow the truncation order for
the discretization scheme. However, temporal convergence rates were found to be
only a weak function of time step used. Additionally, for some config-

exponent itself. These results indicate that convergence properties do not

  equations with random inputs",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this manuscript we discuss weighted reduced order methods for stochastic
partial differential equations. Random inputs (such as forcing terms, equation
coefficients, boundary conditions) are considered as parameters of the
equations. We take advantage of the resulting parametrized formulation to
propose an efficient reduced order model; we also profit by the underlying
stochastic assumption in the definition of suitable weights to drive to
reduction process. Two viable strategies are discussed, namely the weighted
reduced basis method and the weighted proper orthogonal decomposition method. A
numerical example on a parametrized elasticity problem is shown.

examples involving simultaneous inference on several targets, as the importance
weights can take arbitrarily large values, making the estimator highly
unstable. In such situations, alternative multiple IS estimators involving
samples from multiple proposal distributions are preferred. Just like the naive
IS, the success of these multiple IS estimators crucially depends on the choice
of the proposal distributions. The selection of these proposal distributions is
the focus of this article. We propose three methods: (i) a geometric space
filling approach, (ii) a minimax variance approach, and (iii) a maximum entropy
approach. The first two methods are applicable to any IS estimator, whereas the
third approach is described in the context of Doss's (2010) two-stage IS
estimator. For the first method, we propose a suitable measure of 'closeness'
based on the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence, while the second and third
approaches use estimates of asymptotic variances of Doss's (2010) IS estimator
and Geyer's (1994) reverse logistic regression estimator, respectively. Thus,
when samples from the proposal distributions are obtained by running Markov
chains, we provide consistent spectral variance estimators for these asymptotic
variances. The proposed methods for selecting proposal densities are
illustrated using various detailed examples.

with {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} observations. With a radius of $\sim 2 \,
R_{\oplus}$ and an orbital period of $\sim 33$ days, the planet lies in the
temperate zone of its host star and receives stellar irradiation similar to
Earth. Here we perform radial velocity follow-up observations with the visual
channel of CARMENES with the goal of determining the mass and density of the
planet. We measure a planetary semi-amplitude of $K_b \sim 3.5$ \mpersec\ and a
mass of $M_b \sim 9 \, M_{\oplus}$, yielding a bulk density around $\rho_b \sim
4 \, \mathrm{g \,cm^{-3}}$. This indicates a low-mass planet with a composition
consistent with a solid core and a volatile-rich envelope. A signal at 9 days
was recently reported using radial velocity measurements taken with the HARPS
spectrograph. This was interpreted as being due to a second planet. We see a
weaker, time and wavelength dependent signal in the CARMENES data set and thus
favor stellar activity for its origin. \ktwo\ joins the growing group of
low-mass planets detected in the temperate zone of M dwarfs. The brightness of
the host star in the near-infrared makes the system a good target for detailed
atmospheric studies with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope}.

to last over a time scale which is millions of times the sedimentation time
scale of a grain in the fluid. Compaction occurs uniformly throughout the bed,
but creep is observed to decay exponentially with depth, and decreases over
time. The granular volume fraction in the bed is found to increase
logarithmically, saturating at the random close packing value $\phi_{rcp}

unchanged. We demonstrate that an increasingly higher shear stress is required
to erode the bed after a sub-critical shear is applied which results in an
increase in its volume fraction. Thus, we find that bed armoring occurs due to
a deep shear-induced relaxation of the bed towards the volume fraction
associated with the glass transition.

It is found that the branching ratio varies drastically with the SUSY scale.
Typically the $Br[B_s^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-]_{\rm untagged}$ varies $\sim 0.6 \times

calculating the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson for low, intermediate

  Reversible Policies",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reinforcement learning, temporal difference (TD) is the most direct
algorithm to learn the value function of a policy. For large or infinite state
spaces, exact representations of the value function are usually not available,
and it must be approximated by a function in some parametric family.
  However, with \emph{nonlinear} parametric approximations (such as neural
networks), TD is not guaranteed to converge to a good approximation of the true
value function within the family, and is known to diverge even in relatively
simple cases. TD lacks an interpretation as a stochastic gradient descent of an
error between the true and approximate value functions, which would provide
such guarantees.
  We prove that approximate TD is a gradient descent provided the current
policy is \emph{reversible}. This holds even with nonlinear approximations.
  A policy with transition probabilities $P(s,s')$ between states is reversible
if there exists a function $\mu$ over states such that
$\frac{P(s,s')}{P(s',s)}=\frac{\mu(s')}{\mu(s)}$. In particular, every move can
be undone with some probability. This condition is restrictive; it is
satisfied, for instance, for a navigation problem in any unoriented graph.
  In this case, approximate TD is exactly a gradient descent of the
\emph{Dirichlet norm}, the norm of the difference of \emph{gradients} between
the true and approximate value functions. The Dirichlet norm also controls the
bias of approximate policy gradient. These results hold even with no decay
factor ($\gamma=1$) and do not rely on contractivity of the Bellman operator,
thus proving stability of TD even with $\gamma=1$ for reversible policies.

is the formation of HO$_2$$^{-}$ and H$_2$O$^{-}$ ions from an electron-induced
chemical reaction between the two dopants. The chemistry leading to these

than O$_2$. The electron resonances for H$_2$ can lead to dissociative electron
attachment (DEA), just as for the free H$_2$ molecule. However, there is
evidence that the resonance in H$_2$ can also lead to rapid electron transfer
to O$_2$, which then induces DEA of the O$_2$. This kind of excitation transfer

quadrotor Nonlinear Control System (NCS) solutions ignore motor control
authority limitations, especially important during aggressive attitude
maneuvers, generating unrealizable thrusts and negating the validity of the
accompanying stability proofs. Here, an attitude control framework is
developed, comprised by a thrust allocation strategy and a specially designed
geometric attitude tracking controller, allowing the quadrotor to achieve
aggressive attitude maneuvers, while complying to actuator constraints and
simultaneously staying ""close"" to a desired position command in a
computationally inexpensive way. This is a novel contribution resulting in
thrusts realizable by available quadrotors during aggressive attitude
maneuvers, and enhanced performance guaranteed by valid stability proofs. Also,
it is shown that the developed controller can be combined with a collective
thrust expression in producing a position/yaw tracking controller. Through
rigorous stability proofs, both the position and attitude frameworks are shown
to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global. This
establishes a quadrotor control solution allowing the vehicle to negotiate
aggressive maneuvers position/attitude on SE(3). Simulations illustrate and

we can directly convert Shannon's channels into semantic channels by the third

labels. For simplifying learning, we may only obtain the truth functions of
some atomic label. For a given label, instances are divided into three kinds
(positive, negative, and unclear) instead of two kinds as in popular studies so
that the problem with binary relevance is avoided. For each instance, the
classifier selects a compound label with most semantic information or richest
connotation. As a predictive model, the semantic channel does not change with
the prior probability distribution (source) of instances. It still works when
the source is changed. The classifier changes with the source, and hence can
overcome class-imbalance problem. It is shown that the old population's

significant negative performance impact of DRAM refresh with intelligent memory
controller mechanisms.
  To mitigate the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh, our HPCA 2014
paper proposes two complementary mechanisms, DARP (Dynamic Access Refresh
Parallelization) and SARP (Subarray Access Refresh Parallelization). The goal
is to address the drawbacks of state-of-the-art per-bank refresh mechanism by
building more efficient techniques to parallelize refreshes and accesses within
DRAM. First, instead of issuing per-bank refreshes in a round-robin order, as
it is done today, DARP issues per-bank refreshes to idle banks in an
out-of-order manner. Furthermore, DARP proactively schedules refreshes during
intervals when a batch of writes are draining to DRAM. Second, SARP exploits
the existence of mostly-independent subarrays within a bank. With minor
modifications to DRAM organization, it allows a bank to serve memory accesses
to an idle subarray while another subarray is being refreshed. Our extensive
evaluations on a wide variety of workloads and systems show that our mechanisms
improve system performance (and energy efficiency) compared to three
state-of-the-art refresh policies, and their performance bene ts increase as
DRAM density increases.

proportional to the product of head difference and turbine flow. The equation
relating power to hydraulic variables is therefore nonlinear. Hence,
optimization problems subject to this relation, such as release schedule
optimization, are nonconvex and may admit multiple local isolated minima. This
renders such problems problematic for use in operational model predictive
control. This paper shows that release schedule optimization problems subject
to the nonlinear turbine generation equation may be set up using a continuation
approach to be both zero-convex and path stable. In this way such optimization
problems become suitable for decision support systems based on model predictive

presents a significant privacy threat to the users, even when the traces are
anonymized, since the statistical matching of an anonymized trace to prior user
behavior can identify a user and their habits. Because of the current and
growing algorithmic and computational capabilities of adversaries, provable
privacy guarantees as a function of the degree of anonymization and obfuscation
of the traces are necessary. Our previous work has established the requirements
on anonymization and obfuscation in the case that data traces are independent

association graph, revealing which user data traces are correlated. Next, we
demonstrate that the adversary can use this association graph to break user
privacy with significantly shorter traces than in the case when traces are

reverberation, which dramatically degrades the performance of automatic speech
recognition (ASR) systems. To alleviate this issue, the commonest way is to use
a well-designed speech enhancement approach as the front-end of ASR. However,
more complex pipelines, more computations and even higher hardware costs
(microphone array) are additionally consumed for this kind of methods. In
addition, speech enhancement would result in speech distortions and mismatches
to training. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training method to
directly boost noise robustness of acoustic model. Specifically, a jointly
compositional scheme of generative adversarial net (GAN) and neural
network-based acoustic model (AM) is used in the training phase. GAN is used to
generate clean feature representations from noisy features by the guidance of a
discriminator that tries to distinguish between the true clean signals and
generated signals. The joint optimization of generator, discriminator and AM
concentrates the strengths of both GAN and AM for speech recognition.
Systematic experiments on CHiME-4 show that the proposed method significantly
improves the noise robustness of AM and achieves the average relative error
rate reduction of 23.38% and 11.54% on the development and test set,
respectively.

to a FLRW with accelerating expansion only after averaging over large scales,

to derive mathematical guarantees for the resulting change detection which
enables accurate identification and counting of the true pulses. The approach
is described and tested using both synthetic and experimental data obtained
using an engine lathe instrumented with a laser tachometer. The described

by fusion of multiple deep neural network (DNN) systems. Pedestrian candidates
are first generated by a single shot convolutional multi-box detector at
different locations with various scales and aspect ratios. The candidate
generator is designed to provide the majority of ground truth pedestrian
annotations at the cost of a large number of false positives. Then, a
classification system using the idea of ensemble learning is deployed to
improve the detection accuracy. The classification system further classifies
the generated candidates based on opinions of multiple deep verification
networks and a fusion network which utilizes a novel soft-rejection fusion
method to adjust the confidence in the detection results. To improve the
training of the deep verification networks, a novel soft-label method is
devised to assign floating point labels to the generated pedestrian candidates.
A deep context aggregation semantic segmentation network also provides
pixel-level classification of the scene and its results are softly fused with
the detection results by the single shot detector. Our pedestrian detector
compared favorably to state-of-art methods on all popular pedestrian detection
datasets. For example, our fused DNN has better detection accuracy on the
Caltech Pedestrian dataset than all previous state of art methods, while also
being the fastest. We significantly improved the log-average miss rate on the
Caltech pedestrian dataset to 7.67% and achieved the new state-of-the-art.

vehicles. However, to deal with the amount of perceived information, we also
require segmentation strategies. Based on a grid map environment
representation, well-suited for sensor fusion, free-space estimation and
machine learning, we detect and classify objects using deep convolutional
neural networks. As input for our networks we use a multi-layer grid map
efficiently encoding 3D range sensor information. The inference output consists
of a list of rotated bounding boxes with associated semantic classes. We
conduct extensive ablation studies, highlight important design considerations
when using grid maps and evaluate our models on the KITTI Bird's Eye View
benchmark. Qualitative and quantitative benchmark results show that we achieve
robust detection and state of the art accuracy solely using top-view grid maps
from range sensor data.

The goal is to produce utterance-level valence and arousal estimations for

extracting facial expressions features of videos as time series data, and then
using Recurrent Neural Networks of the Echo State Network type to model the
correspondence between the time series data and valence-arousal values.

  by GPU","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1803.11036",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Super point is a kind of special host in the network which contacts with huge
of other hosts. Estimating its cardinality, the number of other hosts
contacting with it, plays important roles in network management. But all of
existing works focus on discrete time window super point cardinality estimation
which has great latency and ignores many measuring periods. Sliding time window
measures super point cardinality in a finer granularity than that of discrete
time window but also more complex. This paper firstly introduces an algorithm
to estimate super point cardinality under sliding time window from distributed
edge routers. This algorithm's ability of sliding super point cardinality
estimating comes from a novel method proposed in this paper which can record
the time that a host appears. Based on this method, two sliding cardinality
estimators, sliding rough estimator and sliding linear estimator, are devised
for super points detection and their cardinalities estimation separately. When
using these two estimators together, the algorithm consumes the smallest memory
with the highest accuracy. This sliding super point cardinality algorithm can
be deployed in distributed environment and acquire the global super points'
cardinality by merging estimators of distributed nodes. Both of these
estimators could process packets parallel which makes it becom possible to deal
with high speed network in real time by GPU. Experiments on a real world
traffic show that this algorithm have the highest accuracy and the smallest
memory comparing with others when running under discrete time window. Under
sliding time window, this algorithm also has the same performance as under
discrete time window.

software, that are heavily dependent on, and influenced by, interactions with
the real world. They can be variously categorised as embedded, cyberphysical,
real-time, hybrid, adaptive and even autonomous systems, with a typical robotic
system being likely to contain all of these aspects. The techniques for
developing and verifying each of these system varieties are often quite
distinct. This, together with the sheer complexity of robotic systems, leads us
to argue that diverse formal techniques must be integrated in order to develop,
verify, and provide certification evidence for, robotic systems. Furthermore,
we propose the fast evolving field of robotics as an ideal catalyst for the
advancement of integrated formal methods research, helping to drive the field
in new and exciting directions and shedding light on the development of
large-scale, dynamic, complex systems.
