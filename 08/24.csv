sonography. Several methods have been proposed in the medical ultrasound
literature aiming at accelerating the image acquisition. In this paper, we
consider one such method called \textit{multi-line transmission} (MLT), in
which several evenly separated focused beams are transmitted simultaneously.
While MLT reduces the acquisition time, it comes at the expense of a heavy loss
of contrast due to the interactions between the beams (cross-talk artifact). In
this paper, we introduce a data-driven method to reduce the artifacts arising
in MLT. To this end, we propose to train an end-to-end convolutional neural
network consisting of correction layers followed by a constant apodization
layer. The network is trained on pairs of raw data obtained through MLT and the
corresponding \textit{single-line transmission} (SLT) data. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates significant improvement both in the visual image
quality and in objective measures such as contrast ratio and contrast-to-noise
ratio, while preserving resolution unlike traditional apodization-based
methods. We show that the proposed method is able to generalize well across
different patients and anatomies on real and phantom data.

theoretically derive and experimentally demonstrate the fundamental limits of
intensity enhancement of the focal point and relate them to the intrinsic
properties of the scattering phenomenon. We demonstrate that the intensity
enhancement limitation becomes dominant when the focusing plane gets closer to

intuitively explains how the microparticle position and the laser power become

position due to scattering, so the laser intensity grows whenever the particle
tries to escape. This scheme allows trapping at very low numerical apertures

non-conservative forces which can be either external or internal, generically
hold the signature of the net dissipation of energy in the thermostat. Yet,
disentangling precisely how dissipation changes collective effects remains
challenging in many-body systems due to the complex interplay between driving
and particle interactions. First, we combine explicit coarse-graining and
stochastic calculus to obtain simple relations between diffusion, density
correlations and dissipation in nonequilibrium liquids. Based on these results,
we consider large-deviation biased ensembles where trajectories mimic the
effect of an external drive. The choice of the biasing function is informed by
the connection between dissipation and structure derived in the first part.
Using analytical and computational techniques, we show that biasing
trajectories effectively renormalizes interactions in a controlled manner, thus
providing intuition on how driving forces can lead to spatial organization and
collective dynamics. Altogether, our results show how tuning dissipation

strategies in Monte Carlo rendering. In this paper, we propose a novel
importance sampling technique that uses a neural network to learn how to sample

an existing Monte Carlo rendering algorithm as a black box. During a
scene-dependent training phase, we learn to generate samples with a desired
density in the primary sample space of the rendering algorithm using maximum

was designed to represent real-valued non-volume preserving ('Real NVP')
transformations in high dimensional spaces. We use Real NVP to non-linearly
warp primary sample space and obtain desired densities. In addition, Real NVP
efficiently computes the determinant of the Jacobian of the warp, which is
required to implement the change of integration variables implied by the warp.
A main advantage of our approach is that it is agnostic of underlying light
transport effects, and can be combined with many existing rendering techniques
by treating them as a black box. We show that our approach leads to effective

geosciences. It is used as a numerical tool for state vector prognosis and
parameter estimation. The EnKF can, for example, help to evaluate the
geothermal potential of an aquifer. In such applications, the EnKF is often
used with small or medium ensemble sizes. It is therefore of interest to
characterize the EnKF behavior for these ensemble sizes. For seven ensemble
sizes (50, 70, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000) and seven EnKF-variants (Damped,
Iterative, Local, Hybrid, Dual, Normal Score and Classical EnKF), we computed
1000 synthetic parameter estimation experiments for two set-ups: a 2D tracer
transport problem and a 2D flow problem with one injection well. For each
model, the only difference among synthetic experiments was the generated set of
random permeability fields. The 1000 synthetic experiments allow to calculate
the pdf of the RMSE of the characterization of the permeability field.
Comparing mean RMSEs for different EnKF-variants, ensemble sizes and
flow/transport set-ups suggests that multiple synthetic experiments are needed
for a solid performance comparison. In this work, 10 synthetic experiments were
needed to correctly distinguish RMSE differences between EnKF-variants smaller
than 10%. For detecting RMSE differences smaller than 2%, 100 synthetic
experiments were needed for ensemble sizes 50, 70, 100 and 250. The overall
ranking of the EnKF-variants is strongly dependent on the physical model set-up
and the ensemble size.

shown to be fundamental resources for one-sided device-independent quantum
information processing tasks and, hence, identification of EPR steerable states
becomes important from foundational as well as informational theoretic
perspectives. In the present study we propose a new criteria to detect whether
a given two-qubit state is EPR steerable. From an arbitrary given two-qubit
state, another two-qubit state is constructed in such a way that the given

steerability of an arbitrary two-qubit state can be detected by detecting
entanglement of the newly constructed state. Apart from providing a distinctive
way to detect EPR steering without using any steering inequality, the novel
finding in the present study paves a new direction to avoid locality loophole
in EPR steering tests and to reduce the ""complexity cost"" present in
experimentally detecting EPR steering. We also generalise our criteria to
detect EPR steering of higher dimensional quantum states. Finally, we
illustrate our result by using our proposed technique to detect EPR

the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) links to enable high data rate D2D

formulate the optimization problem of joint cellular and D2D resource

closed-form solution for D2D resource allocation, which reveals useful insights
for practical system design. Numerical results from extensive system-level
simulations demonstrate that the rate performance of cellular users is

future climate change on economic, health and other outcomes. In most studies,
an annual outcome variable is observed, e.g. agricultural yield, along with a
higher-frequency regressor, e.g. daily temperature. Applied researchers then
face a problem of selecting a model to characterize the nonlinear relationship
between the outcome and the high-frequency regressor to make a policy
recommendation based on the model-implied damage function. We show that
existing model selection criteria are only suitable for the policy objective if
one of the models under consideration nests the true model. If all models are
seen as imperfect approximations to the true nonlinear relationship, the model
that performs well in the normal climate conditions is not guaranteed to
perform well at the projected climate that is different from the historical
norm. We therefore propose a new criterion, the proximity-weighted mean-squared
error (PWMSE), that directly targets precision of the damage function at the
projected future climate. To make this criterion feasible, we assign higher
weights to prior years that can serve as weather analogs to the projected
future climate when evaluating competing models using the PWMSE. We show that
our approach selects the best approximate regression model that has the
smallest weighted error of predicted impacts for a projected future climate. A

covariant formalism of Ashtekar and Hansen by constructing a 3-manifold of both
null and spatial directions of approach to spatial infinity. This allows us to
systematically impose appropriate regularity conditions on the Maxwell fields
near spatial infinity along null directions. The Maxwell equations on this
3-manifold and the regularity conditions imply that the relevant field
quantities on past null infinity are antipodally matched to those on future
null infinity. Imposing the condition that in a scattering process the total
flux of charges through spatial infinity vanishes, we isolate the subalgebra of
totally fluxless symmetries near spatial infinity. This subalgebra provides a
natural isomorphism between the asymptotic symmetry algebras on past and future
null infinity, such that the corresponding charges are equal near spatial
infinity. This proves that the flux of charges is conserved from past to future
null infinity in a classical scattering process of Maxwell fields. We also
comment on possible extensions of our method to scattering in general

is considered, in which a base station (BS) is communicating with two
legitimate users in two possible scenarios of unsecure environments: existence
of an external eavesdropper and communicating through an untrusted relay. For
the first scenario, a number of trusted cooperative half-duplex relays is
employed to assist with the BS's transmission and secure its signals from the
external eavesdropper. Various relaying schemes are proposed and analyzed for
that matter: cooperative jamming, decode-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward.
For each scheme, secure beamforming signals are devised at the relays to
maximize the achievable secrecy rate regions. For the second scenario, with the
untrusted relay, achievable secrecy rate regions are derived for two different
relaying schemes: compress-and-forward and amplify-and-forward, under two
different modes of operation. In the first mode, coined passive user mode, the
users receive signals from both the BS and the untrusted relay, and combine
them to decode their messages. In the second mode, coined active user mode, the
users transmit a cooperative jamming signal simultaneously with the BS's
transmission to further confuse the relay. Focusing on half-duplex nodes, the
users cannot receive the BS's signal while jamming the relay, i.e., while being
active, and rely only on the signals forwarded to them by the relay. It is
shown that the best relaying scheme highly depends on the system parameters, in
particular distances between the nodes, and also on which part of the secrecy
rate region the system is to operate at.

the history of metal enrichment and outflows in a suite of twenty
high-resolution simulated galaxies. These simulations agree with the observed
stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation, an agreement that relies on
large fractions of the produced metals escaping into the CGM. For instance, in
galaxies with Mvir ~ 1e9.5 -- 1e10 solar masses, we find that about ~ 85% of
the available metals are outside of the galactic disk at z = 0, although the
fraction decreases to a little less than half in Milky Way-mass galaxies. In
many cases, these metals are spread far beyond the virial radius. We analyze
the metal deficit within the ISM and stars in the context of previous work
tracking the inflow and outflow of baryons. Outflows are prevalent across the
entire mass range, as is reaccretion. We find that between 40 and 80% of all
metals removed from the galactic disk are later reaccreted. The outflows
themselves are metal enriched relative to the ISM by a factor of 0.2 dex
because of the correspondence between sites of metal enrichment and outflows.
As a result, the metal mass loading factor scales as eta_metals \propto
v_circ^-0.91, a somewhat shallower scaling than the total mass loading factor.
We analyze the simulated galaxies within the context of analytic chemical
evolution models by determining their net metal expulsion efficiencies, which
encapsulate the rates of metal loss and reaccretion. We discuss these results
in light of the inflow and outflow properties necessary for reproducing the

Galaxy reflecting properties of the whole Galactic potential. Determining their
origin is of fundamental importance to constrain the shape and mass of the dark
halo. The leading scenario for the ejection of HVSs is an encounter with the
supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre. However, new proper motions
from the \textit{Gaia} mission indicate that only the fastest HVSs can be
traced back to the Galactic centre and the remaining stars originate in the
disc or halo. In this paper, we study HVSs generated by encounters of stellar
binaries with an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a star
cluster. For the first time, we model the effect of the cluster orbit in the
Galactic potential on the observable properties of the ejected population. HVSs
generated by this mechanism do not travel on radial orbits consistent with a
Galactic centre origin, but rather point back to their parent cluster, thus
providing observational evidence for the presence of an IMBH. We also model the
ejection of high-velocity stars from the Galactic population of globular
clusters, assuming that they all contain an IMBH, including the effects of the
cluster's orbit and propagation of the star in the Galactic potential up to
detection. We find that high-velocity stars ejected by IMBHs have distinctive
distributions in velocity, Galactocentric distance and Galactic latitude, which
can be used to distinguish them from runaway stars and stars ejected from the

sample of O stars within our Galaxy was spectroscopically identified and
presented in the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSS). At the same time,
a large high-fidelity catalog of X-ray sources detected by the XMM-Newton X-ray

spectral type as well as stellar and wind parameters. We find that, among the
GOSS sample, 127 O-stars have a unique XMM-Newton source counterpart and a Gaia

of 35 of these stars. We confirm that the X-ray luminosities of dwarf and giant
O stars correlate with their bolometric luminosity. For the subsample of O
stars with measure terminal velocities we find that the X-ray luminosities of
dwarf and giant O stars also correlate with wind parameters. However, we find
that these correlations break down for supergiant stars. Moreover, we show that
supergiant stars are systematically harder in X-rays compared to giant and
dwarf O-type stars. We find that the X-ray luminosity depends on spectral type,
but seems to be independent of whether the stars are single or in a binary
system. Finally, we show that the distribution of log(Lx/Lbol) in our sample
stars is non-Gaussian, with the peak of the distribution at log(Lx/Lbol) around

different phenotypes or living in different spatial locations. External
variables include abiotic factors or non-focal species. These internal or
external variables may fluctuate due to stochastic fluctuations in
environmental conditions. We prove theorems for stochastic persistence and
exclusion for stochastic ecological difference equations accounting for
internal and external variables. Specifically, we use a stochastic analog of
average Lyapunov functions to develop sufficient and necessary conditions for
(i) all population densities spending little time at low densities, and (ii)
population trajectories asymptotically approaching the extinction set with
positive probability. For (i) and (ii), respectively, we provide quantitative
estimates on the fraction of time that the system is near the extinction set,
and the probability of asymptotic extinction as a function of the initial state
of the system. Furthermore, we provide lower bounds for the expected time to
escape neighborhoods of the extinction set. To illustrate the applicability of
our results, we analyze stochastic models of evolutionary games, Lotka-Volterra
dynamics, trait evolution, and spatially structured disease dynamics. Our
analysis of these models demonstrates environmental stochasticity facilitates
coexistence of strategies in the hawk-dove game, but inhibits coexistence in
the rock-paper-scissors game and a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.
Furthermore, environmental fluctuations with positive auto-correlations can
promote persistence of evolving populations and persistence of diseases in
patchy landscapes. While our results help close the gap between the persistence
theories for deterministic and stochastic systems, we highlight challenges for
future research.

the key ingredients in obtaining evolutionary predictions for compact binary
(BH-BH / BH-NS / NS-NS) merger rates. Until now, such calculations were done
under the assumption that initial binary parameter distributions were
independent. Here, we implement empirically derived inter-correlated
distributions of initial binary parameters primary mass (M1), mass ratio (q),
orbital period (P), and eccentricity (e). Unexpectedly, the introduction of
inter-correlated initial binary parameters leads to only a small decrease in
the predicted merger rates by a factor of 2 $-$ 3 relative to the previously
used non-correlated initial distributions. The formation of compact object
mergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with
stars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 $-$ 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log
P (days) = 2 $-$ 4). New distributions slightly shift the mass ratios towards
smaller values with respect to the previously used flat q distribution, which
is the dominant effect decreasing the rates. New orbital periods only
negligibly increase the number of progenitors. Additionally, we discuss the
uncertainty of merger rate predictions associated with possible variations of
the massive-star initial mass function (IMF). We argue that evolutionary
calculations should be normalized to a star formation rate (SFR) that is
obtained from the observed amount of UV light at wavelength 1500{\AA} (SFR
indicator). In this case, contrary to recent reports, the uncertainty of the
IMF does not affect the rates by more than a factor of 2. Any change to the IMF
slope for massive stars requires a change of SFR in a way that counteracts the
impact of IMF variations on the merger rates. In contrast, we suggest that the
uncertainty in cosmic SFR at low metallicity can be a significant factor at
play.

gathered in short unbiased MD simulations, to construct the collective
variables as linear combinations of a set of descriptors. Here, to scale up our
examination of the method's efficiency, we applied it to the folding of
Chignolin in water. Interestingly, already before any biased simulations were
run, the constructed one dimensional collective variable revealed much of the
physics that underlies the folding process. In addition, using it in
Metadynamics we were able to run simulations in which the system goes from the

we combined Metadynamics with Parallel Tempering. Finally, we examined how the

The report, entitled ""Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030,"" examines eight
domains of typical urban settings on which AI is likely to have impact over the
coming years: transportation, home and service robots, healthcare, education,
public safety and security, low-resource communities, employment and workplace,
and entertainment. It aims to provide the general public with a scientifically
and technologically accurate portrayal of the current state of AI and its
potential and to help guide decisions in industry and governments, as well as
to inform research and development in the field. This article by the chair of
the 2016 Study Panel and the inaugural chair of the AI100 Standing Committee
describes the origins of this ambitious longitudinal study, discusses the
framing of the inaugural report, and presents the report's main findings. It
concludes with a brief description of the AI100 project's ongoing efforts and
planned next steps.

sensitivity-based optimization theory to find the optimal energy-efficient
policy of a data center with two groups of heterogeneous servers. Servers in
Group 1 always work at high energy consumption, while servers in Group 2 may
either work at high energy consumption or sleep at low energy consumption. An
energy-efficient control policy determines the switch between work and sleep
states of servers in Group 2 in a dynamic way. Since servers in Group 1 are
always working with high priority to jobs, a transfer rule is proposed to
migrate the jobs in Group 2 to idle servers in Group 1. To find the optimal
energy-efficient policy, we set up a policy-based Poisson equation, and provide
explicit expressions for its unique solution of performance potentials by means
of the RG-factorization. Based on this, we characterize monotonicity and
optimality of the long-run average profit with respect to the policies under
different service prices. We prove that the bang-bang control is always optimal
for this optimization problem, i.e., we should either keep all servers sleep or
turn on the servers such that the number of working servers equals that of
waiting jobs in Group 2. As an easy adoption of policy forms, we further study
the threshold-type policy and obtain a necessary condition of the optimal
threshold policy. We hope the methodology and results derived in this paper can
shed light to the study of more general energy-efficient data centers.

spread over $\Delta v_{90}$ = 114 km s$^{-1}$, seven of which harbour H2.
Column densities of atomic and molecular species are derived through Voigt
profile analysis of their absorption lines. We measure total N(H I), N(H2) and
N(HD) to be 20.35+/-0.05, 17.99+/-0.05 and 14.28+/-0.08 (log cm$^{-2}$)

vibrational state. The DLA has metallicity, Z = 0.3 Z$_\sun$ ([S/H] =
-0.52+/-0.06) and dust-to-gas ratio, $\kappa$ = 0.34+/-0.07. Numerical models
of the H2 components are constrained individually to understand the physical
structure of the DLA. We conclude that the DLA is subjected to the metagalactic
background radiation and cosmic ray ionization rate of $\sim$ 10$^{-15.37}$
s$^{-1}$. Dust grains in this DLA are smaller than grains in the Galactic
interstellar medium. The inner molecular regions of the H2 components have
density, temperature and gas pressure in the range 30-120 cm$^{-3}$, 140-360 K

significant constituent of the total pressure, and can play an important role
in these innermost regions. Our H2 component models enable us to constrain
component-wise N(H I), and elemental abundances of sulphur, silicon, iron and
carbon. We deduce the line-of-sight thickness of the H2-bearing parts of the

negative interest rates in the countries that adopted them as part of their
monetary policy. We conclude by discussing alternative ways to overcome this

the variations in these timings, sub-stellar or planet companions orbiting
around the binary system can be identified. In this paper, additional bodies
orbiting the Algol type binary DI Peg are examined by using the archival
eclipse timings including our CCD data observed at the Ankara University
Kreiken Observatory. More than five hundred minimum times equivalent to around
nine decades are employed to identify the orbital behavior of the binary
system. The best fit to the timings shows that the orbital period of DI Peg has
variation due to an integration of two sinusoids with the periods of $P_3 =
49.50\pm0.36$ yr and $P_4 = 27.40\pm0.24$ yr. The orbital change is thought to
be most likely due to the existence of two M-type red dwarf companions with the
masses of $M_3 =0.213 \pm 0.021$ M$_\odot$ and $M_4 = 0.151 \pm 0.008$
M$_\odot$, assuming that the orbits of additional bodies are co-planar with the
orbit of the binary system. Also, the residuals of two sinusoidal fits still
seem to show another modulation with the period of roughly $P = 19.5$ yr. The
origin of this modulation is not clear and more observational data are required
to reveal if the periodicity is caused by another object gravitationally
bounded to the system.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.PL cs.SE cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent drive towards achieving greater autonomy and intelligence in
robotics has led to high levels of complexity. Autonomous robots increasingly
depend on third party off-the-shelf components and complex machine-learning
techniques. This trend makes it challenging to provide strong design-time
certification of correct operation.
  To address these challenges, we present SOTER, a robotics programming
framework with two key components: (1) a programming language for implementing
and testing high-level reactive robotics software and (2) an integrated runtime
assurance (RTA) system that helps enable the use of uncertified components,
while still providing safety guarantees. SOTER provides language primitives to
declaratively construct a RTA module consisting of an advanced,
high-performance controller (uncertified), a safe, lower-performance controller
(certified), and the desired safety specification. The framework provides a
formal guarantee that a well-formed RTA module always satisfies the safety
specification, without completely sacrificing performance by using higher
performance uncertified components whenever safe. SOTER allows the complex
robotics software stack to be constructed as a composition of RTA modules,
where each uncertified component is protected using a RTA module.
  To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we consider a real-world
case-study of building a safe drone surveillance system. Our experiments both
in simulation and on actual drones show that the SOTER-enabled RTA ensures the
safety of the system, including when untrusted third-party components have bugs
or deviate from the desired behavior.

Waals functional. We examine the finite temperature range of $300$K-$500$K and
pressures between $2$GPa-$7$GPa. We find that in this P-T range MH-III is less
dense than liquid water.
  There is uncertainty in the normalized moment of inertia (MOI) of Titan; it
is estimated to be in the range of $0.33-0.34$. If Titan's MOI is $0.34$,
MH-III is not stable at present in Titan's interior, yielding an easier path
for the outgassing of CH$_4$. However, for an MOI of $0.33$, MH-III is
thermodynamically stable at the bottom of a ice-rock internal layer capable of
storing CH$_4$. For rock mass fractions $\lessapprox 0.2$ upwelling melt is
likely hot enough to dissociate MH-III along its path. For super-Titans
considering a mixture of MH-III and ice VII, melt is always positively buoyant
if the H$_2$O:CH$_4$ mole fraction is $>5.5$. Our thermal evolution model shows
that MH-III may be present today in Titan's core, confined to a thin ($\approx
10$km) outer shell. We find that the heat capacity of MH-III is higher than
measured values for pure water-ice, larger than heat capacity often adopted for
ice-rock mixtures with implications for internal heating.

Trapped ions are strong candidates for communication nodes owing to their long
qubit life time (C. Langer, et al., PRL., 238, 060502, (2005)) and high
fidelity ion-photon entanglement (A. Stute, et al., Nat., 485, 482, (2012)),

Development of these two quantum technologies has largely proceeded in separate
tracks, partly due to their disparate wavelengths of operation, but combining
these platforms offers a compelling hybrid quantum system for use in quantum
networking and distributed quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate the first
interaction of photons emitted from a trapped ion, with neutral atoms by
implementing slow light in a warm atomic vapour. We use two hyperfine
absorption resonances in a warm $^{87}$Rb vapour to provide a slow light medium
in which a single photon from a trapped Ba$^+$ ion is delayed by up to
13.5$\pm$0.5 ns. The delay is tunable and preserves the temporal properties of
the photons. This result showcases a hybrid interface, useful for linking
different quantum systems together, or as a synchronisation tool for the
arrival times of photons - an essential tool for future quantum networks.

by treating a $p$-dimensional time series as a nonsingular linear
transformation of certain common factors and idiosyncratic components. Unlike
the approximate factor models, we assume that the factors capture all the
non-trivial dynamics of the data, but the cross-sectional dependence may be
explained by both the factors and the idiosyncratic components. Under the
proposed model, (a) the factor process is dynamically dependent and the
idiosyncratic component is a white noise process, and (b) the largest
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic components may
diverge to infinity as the dimension $p$ increases. We propose a white noise
testing procedure for high-dimensional time series to determine the number of
white noise components and, hence, the number of common factors, and introduce
a projected Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to eliminate the diverging
effect of the idiosyncratic noises. Asymptotic properties of the proposed
method are established for both fixed $p$ and diverging $p$ as the sample size
$n$ increases to infinity. We use both simulated data and real examples to
assess the performance of the proposed method. We also compare our method with
two commonly used methods in the literature concerning the forecastability of
the extracted factors and find that the proposed approach not only provides
interpretable results, but also performs well in out-of-sample forecasting.

or to augment some parts of its functionality. However, these modifications
usually also introduce errors that affect the already-working code. There are
several approaches and tools that help to spot and find the source of these
errors. However, most of these errors could be avoided beforehand by using some
of the knowledge that the programmers had when they were writing the code. This
is the idea behind the design-by-contract approach, where users can define
contracts that can be checked during runtime. In this paper, we apply the
principles of this approach to Erlang, enabling, in this way, a runtime
verification system in this language. We define two types of contracts. One of

point of interest (POI) testing. A POI, in this context, is any expression of a
program. The approach receives as input a set of relations between POIs from a
version of a program and POIs from another version, and also a sequence of
input functions, i.e. test cases. Then, a program instrumentation, an input
test case generation and different comparison functions are used to obtain the
final report which indicates whether the alternative version of the program
behaves as expected, e.g. it produces the same values or it uses less
CPU/memory. In this paper, we explain how we can improve the POI testing
approach through the use of common stack traces and a more sophisticated

the externally driven flow to the perturbation field that sustains turbulence,
nonlinearity is also known to play an essential role. The goal of this study is
to better understand the role of nonlinearity in sustaining turbulence. The
method used in this study is implementation in Couette flow of a statistical
state dynamics (SSD) closure at second order in a cumulant expansion of the
Navier-Stokes equations in which the averaging operator is the streamwise mean.
The perturbations are the deviations from the streamwise mean and two
mechanisms potentially contributing to maintaining these perturbations are
identified. These are parametric perturbation growth arising from interaction
of the perturbations with the fluctuating mean flow and transient growth of
perturbations arising from nonlinear interaction between components of the
perturbation field. By the method of comparing the turbulence maintained in the
SSD and in the associated direct numerical simulation (DNS) in which these
mechanisms have been selectively included and excluded, parametric growth is
found to maintain the perturbation field of the turbulence while the more
commonly invoked mechanism of transient growth of perturbations arising from
scattering by nonlinear interaction is found to suppress perturbation growth.
In addition to verifying that the parametric mechanism maintains the
perturbations in DNS it is also verified that the Lyapunov vectors are the
structures that dominate the perturbation energy and energetics in DNS. It is
further verified that these vectors are responsible for maintaining the roll
circulation that underlies the self-sustaining process (SSP) and in particular
the maintenance of the fluctuating streak that supports the parametric
perturbation growth.

technical analysis, referred derisively by some sources as ""Black Magic"", are
of widespread use in mainstream media and usually met with a lot of
controversy. In this paper we show that different researchers assess this
strategy differently, and the subsequent debate is due more to the lack of
method than purpose. Most results reported are not repeatable by other
researchers. This is not satisfactory if we intend to approach finance as a
hard science. To counterweight the status quo, we demonstrate what one could do

conditions, as would be obtained with the COronal Spectrographic Imager in the
EUV in its coronagraphic mode (COSIE-C). COSIE-C has been proposed to routinely
observe the relatively unexplored outer corona, where we know that many
fundamental processes affecting both the lower corona and the solar wind are
taking place. The COSIE-C spectral band, 186--205 A, is well-known as it has
been observed with Hinode EIS. We present Hinode EIS observations that we
obtained in 2007 out to 1.5 Rsun, to show that this spectral band in quiescent
streamers is dominated by Fe XII and Fe XI and that the ionization temperature
is nearly constant. To estimate the COSIE-C signal in the 1.5--3.1 Rsun region
we use a model based on CHIANTI atomic data and SoHO UVCS observations in the
Si XII and Mg X coronal lines of two quiescent 1996 streamers. We reproduce the
observed EUV radiances with a simple density model, photospheric abundances,
and a constant temperature of 1.4 MK. We show that other theoretical or
semi-empirical models fail to reproduce the observations. We find that the
coronal COSIE-C signal at 3 Rsun should be about 5 counts/s per 3.1"" pixel in
quiescent streamers. This is unprecedented and opens up a significant discovery
space. We also briefly discuss stray light and the visibility of other solar
features. In particular, we present UVCS observations of an active region
streamer, indicating increased signal compared to the quiet Sun cases.

While molecular clouds and the material that forms stars have structures on
many size scales, their larger-scale structures are difficult to observe
reliably in the submillimetre regime using ground-based facilities. In this
paper, we quantify the extent to which three subsequent data-reduction methods
employed by the JCMT GBS accurately recover emission structures of various size
scales, in particular, dense cores which are the focus of many GBS science
goals. With our current best data-reduction procedure, we expect to recover
100% of structures with Gaussian sigma sizes of $\le$30"" and intensity peaks of
at least five times the local noise for isolated peaks of emission. The
measured sizes and peak fluxes of these compact structures are reliable (within
15% of the input values), but source recovery and reliability both decrease
significantly for larger emission structures and for fainter peaks. Additional
factors such as source crowding have not been tested in our analysis. The most
recent JCMT GBS data release includes pointing corrections, and we demonstrate
that these tend to decrease the sizes and increase the peak intensities of
compact sources in our dataset, mostly at a low level (several percent), but

biomolecules. While refractometric optical biosensors are sensitive and
well-established, they are susceptible to any change of the refractive index in
the sensing volume caused by minute variations in composition of the sample
buffer, temperature drifts and nonspecific binding to the sensor surface.
Refractometric biosensors require reference channels as well as temperature
stabilisation and their applicability in complex fluids such as blood is
limited by nonspecific bindings. Focal molography does not measure the
refractive index of the entire sensing volume but detects the diffracted light
from a coherent assembly of analyte molecules. Thus, it does not suffer from
the limitations of refractometric sensors since they stem from non-coherent
processes and therefore do not add to the coherent molographic signal. The
coherent assembly is generated by selective binding of the analyte molecules to
a synthetic binding pattern - the mologram. Focal Molography has been
introduced theoretically and verified experimentally in previous papers.
However, further understanding of the underlying physics and a
diffraction-limited readout is needed to unveil its full potential. This paper
introduces refined theoretical models which can accurately quantify the amount
of matter bound to the mologram from the diffracted intensity. In addition, it
presents measurements of diffraction-limited molographic foci. These
improvements enabled us to demonstrate a resolution in real-time binding
experiments comparable to the best SPR sensors, without the need of temperature
stabilisation or drift correction and to detect small molecules label-free in
an endpoint format. The presented experiments exemplify the robustness and
sensitivity of diffractometric sensors.

to store, share, and replicate results and methods of experiments that are
often multidisciplinary and yield a massive amount of data. Given the
increasing complexity and growing interaction across diverse bodies of
knowledge it is becoming imperative to define a platform to properly support
collaborative research and track origin, accuracy and use of data. This paper
starts by defining a set of methods leveraging scientific principles and
advocating the importance of those methods in multidisciplinary, computer
intensive fields like computational finance. The next part of this paper
defines a class of systems called scientific support systems, vis-a-vis usages
in other research fields such as bioinformatics, physics and engineering. We
outline a basic set of fundamental concepts, and list our goals and motivation
for leveraging such systems to enable large-scale investigation, ""crowd powered
science"", in economics. The core of this paper provides an outline of FRACTI in
five steps. First we present definitions related to scientific support systems
intrinsic to finance and describe common characteristics of financial use
cases. The second step concentrates on what can be exchanged through the
definition of shareable entities called contributions. The third step is the
description of a classification system for building blocks of the conceptual
framework, called facets. The fourth step introduces the meta-model that will
enable provenance tracking and representation of data fragments and simulation.
Finally we describe intended cases of use to highlight main strengths of
FRACTI: application of the scientific method for investigation in computational
finance, large-scale collaboration and simulation.

ancillas provide a platform for encoding and manipulating quantum information.
A key challenge in scaling up the platform is the requirement to communicate on
demand the information between the cavities. It has been recently demonstrated
that a tunable bilinear interaction between two cavities can be realized by
coupling them to a bichromatically-driven transmon ancilla, which allows
swapping and interfering the multi-photon states of the cavities [Gao et al.,
Phys. Rev. X 8, 021073(2018)]. Here, we explore both theoretically and
experimentally the regime of relatively strong drives on the ancilla needed to
achieve fast SWAP gates but which can also lead to undesired non-perturbative
effects that lower the SWAP fidelity. We develop a theoretical formalism based
on linear response theory that allows one to calculate the rate of
ancilla-induced interaction, decay and frequency shift of the cavities in terms
of a susceptibility matrix. We treat the drives non-perturbatively using
Floquet theory, and find that the interference of the two drives can strongly
alter the system dynamics even in the regime where the rotating wave
approximation applies. We identify two major sources of infidelity due to
ancilla decoherence. i) Ancilla dissipation and dephasing leads to incoherent
hopping among Floquet states which occurs even when the ancilla is at zero
temperature, resulting in a sudden change of the SWAP rate. ii) The cavities
inherit finite decay from the relatively lossy ancilla through the inverse
Purcell effect; the effect can be enhanced when the drive-induced AC Stark
shift pushes certain ancilla transition frequencies to the vicinity of the
cavity frequencies. The theoretical predictions agree quantitatively with the
experimental results, paving the way for using the theory to design future
experiments.

creates natural broadcasting opportunities in the delivery phase which are

based on interference alignment which enables each user to decode his desired

converse bounds for uniform demands under uncoded placement to the nonuniform

all permutations of the $N$ files, each caching carefully selected sub-packets

overall converse bound is the maximum of all these $N!$ bounds. We prove that
our achievable delivery rate for the case of two files meets this converse,

measurement domain. This can limit interpretability of the data and
identification of coherent features informative of ocean dynamics. Several
methods exist to fill gaps of missing oceanographic data, and are often based
on projecting the measurements onto basis functions or a statistical model.
Herein, we use an information transport approach inspired from an image
processing algorithm. This approach aims to restore gaps in data by advecting
and diffusing information of features as opposed to the field itself. Since
this method does not involve fitting or projection, the portions of the domain
containing measurements can remain unaltered, and the method offers control
over the extent of local information transfer. This method is applied to
measurements of ocean surface currents by high frequency radars. This is a
relevant application because data coverage can be sporadic and filling data
gaps can be essential to data usability. Application to two regions with
differing spatial scale is considered. The accuracy and robustness of the
method is tested by systematically blinding measurements and comparing the
restored data at these locations to the actual measurements. These results
demonstrate that even for locally large percentages of missing data points, the
restored velocities have errors within the native error of the original data
(e.g., $<10$% for velocity magnitude and $<3$% for velocity direction). Results
were relatively insensitive to model parameters, facilitating a priori
selection of default parameters for de novo applications.

check that in two spacetime dimensions the impurity entropy does not depend on
a particular state of the theory, which is a well-known CFT result. In three

entropy can be given. We compute the entanglement entropy of a line defect at
finite temperature and compare it with earlier calculations of the

flows to the definition of the entropy as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
associated to a portion of the black horizon, which we call impurity ""shadow"".

considering the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background
photons. The sum of the predicted gamma-ray fluxes of these knots is comparable
to that observed with LAT at 10^{24} Hz of the steady gamma-ray component,
indicating that the steady gamma-ray emission may be partially contributed by
these large-scale knots. This may conceal the flux variations of the low-level
gamma-ray emission from the radio-core. The derived bulk Lorentz factors of the
knots decrease along the distance to the core, illustrating as deceleration of
jet in large-scale. The powers of the core and knots are roughly in the same
order, but the jet changes from highly magnetized at the core region into
particle-dominated at the large-scale knots.

two-dimensional (2d) deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP). Our system is a
translationally invariant spin-1/2 chain with on-site $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry
and time reversal symmetry. It undergoes a direct continuous transition from a
ferromagnet (FM), where one of the $Z_2$ symmetries and the time reversal are
broken, to a valence bond solid (VBS), where all on-site symmetries are
restored while the translation symmetry is broken. The other $Z_2$ symmetry
remains unbroken throughout, but its presence is crucial for both the direct
transition (via specific Berry phase effect on topological defects, also
related to a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-like theorem) and the precise characterization
of the VBS phase (which has crystalline-SPT-like property). The transition has
a description in terms of either two domain wall species that ""fractionalize""
the VBS order parameter or in terms of partons that ""fractionalize"" the FM
order parameter, with each picture having its own $Z_2$ gauge structure. The
two descriptions are dual to each other and, at long wavelengths, take the form
of a self-dual \emph{gauged} Ashkin-Teller model, reminiscent of the self-dual
easy-plane non-compact CP$^1$ model that arises in the description of the 2d
easy-plane DQCP. We also find an exact reformulation of the transition that
leads to a simple field theory description that explicitly unifies the FM and
VBS order parameters; this reformulation can be interpreted as a new parton
approach that does not attempt to fractionalize either of the two order
parameters but instead encodes them in instantons. Besides providing explicit
realizations of many ideas proposed in the context of the 2d DQCP, here in the
simpler and fully tractable 1d setting with continuous transition, our study
also suggests possible new line of approach to the 2d DQCP.

commonly portrayed as less of a ""general framework"". Viewed from this
perspective, the paradigm of ""analogue space-times"" is to promote the specific
theory of general relativity (Einstein gravity) to a framework which covers
relativistic phenomena at large. Ultimately, this then also gives rise to new
proposals for experiments in the laboratory, as it allows one to move general
features of the ""relativistic framework"" from general relativity to entirely
new fields. This allows experiments looking into analogies of currently
unobservable phenomena of general relativity proper. The only requirement for
this to work is the presence of a notion of an upper limit for propagation
speeds in this new field. Systems of such a kind abound in physics, as all
hyperbolic wave equations fulfil this requirement.
  Consequently, models for analogue space-times can be found aplenty. We shall
demonstrate this here in two separate analogue space-time models, both taken
from electrodynamics in continuous media. First of all, one can distinguish
between analytic analogue models (where the analogy is based on some specific
hyperbolic differential equation), on the one hand, and algebraic models (where
the analogy is fashioned from the more or less explicit appearance of a metric
tensor), on the other hand. Yet this distinction is more than just a matter of
taste: The analogue space-time model's nature will also determine which
physical concepts from general relativity can be taken easily into an
experimental context. Examples of this will the main aim of this paper, and the
Hawking effect in one of the two models considered the example of most

on non-Cartan MW lattices that are torsion free and whose associated

limited to be a multiple of some particular non-one integer. On the F-theory

geometries, i.e., rational elliptic surface fibrations over $P^1$. Except for
some cases, we obtain such geometries for specific distributions of instantons.
All the spectrum derived from those geometries completely match with the

problem. Here we present an alternate view to explain sequence-to-sequence

example is viewed to represent a local latent distribution in the source or
target domain. Then, we interpret sequence-to-sequence learning as learning a
transductive model to transform the source local latent distributions to match
their corresponding target distributions. In our framework, we approximate both
the source and target latent distributions with recurrent neural networks
(augmenter). During training, the parallel augmenters learn to better
approximate the local latent distributions, while the sequence prediction model
learns to minimize the KL-divergence of the transformed source distributions
and the approximated target distributions. This algorithm can alleviate the
data sparsity issues in sequence learning by locally augmenting more unseen
data pairs and increasing the model's robustness. Experiments conducted on
machine translation and image captioning consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed algorithm over the other competing algorithms.

numerical relativity (NR) simulations are ideal for constraining physical
parameters of heavy black hole merger events. In this paper, we first
demonstrate the viability of these multi-modal surrogates as reliable parameter
estimation tools. We show that NR surrogates can extract additional information
from GW data that is inaccessible to traditional models, by analyzing a set of
synthetic signals with the NR surrogate and other approximants.
  We also consider the case of two of the earliest binary black holes detected
by the LIGO observatories: GW150914 and GW170104. We reanalyze their data with
fully-precessing NR-surrogate templates and freely provide the resulting
posterior samples as supplemental material. We find that our refined analysis
is able to extract information from sub-dominant GW harmonics in data, and
therefore better resolve the degeneracy in measuring source luminosity distance
and orbital inclination for both events. We estimate the sources of both events
to be 20-25% further away than was previously estimated. Our analyses also
constrain their orbital orientation more tightly around face-on or face-off
configurations than before. Additionally, for GW150914 we constrain the
effective inspiral spin more tightly around zero. This work is one of the first
to unambiguously extract sub-dominant GW mode information from real events. It
is also a first step toward eliminating the approximations used in
semi-analytic waveform models from GW parameter estimation. It also motivates
that NR surrogates be extended to cover more of the binary black hole parameter
space.

stochastic geometry to analyze this protocol, comparing it to the standard
spectrum sharing and orthogonal allocation protocols. We then formulate a
stochastic optimization problem to optimize the nominal IoT transmit power,
maximizing the average energy-efficiency (EE) of the IoT device subject to
interference constraints to protect UEs. Simulations are presented to validate
the theoretical insights and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. It is
shown that using drones, to aggregate IoT traffic, improves the EE of IoT

optimizing the transmit power is critical to further improve the EE, while
ensuring fair coexistence with UEs.

we construct an effective model describing the behavior of magnetically active

layer is mainly formed by superexchange interactions in the same plane, the
spin-dependence of $\boldsymbol{P}$ arises from the stacking misalignment of
such planes in the perpendicular direction, which is inherent to the lacunar
spinel structure. We predict a strong competition of isotropic, $\sim

snowflakes and rimers, charge separation, corona discharge, avalanche
ionization, ionic wind originating from the positively and negatively charged
masses of cloud, vortex motion and turbulence when mixed with the updraft, more
collision, more charge separation, stronger corona discharge, and so on.
Meanwhile, avalanche ionization would produce more CCN (cloud condensation
nuclei) resulting in more precipitation and hence rimers formation in the
super-saturated environment. More collision in the buoyant turbulence would
lead to more fusion of droplets and the formation of larger rimers. The cyclic
processes would repeat themselves until the electric field between the two
oppositely charged masses of cloud was strong enough to induce a breakdown. The
latter would create a sudden short circuit between the two charged masses of
cloud neutralizing the charges. There would be no more ionic wind, hence, much
less buoyant turbulence. The updraft alone would not be sufficiently strong to
support larger rimers which would fall down 'suddenly' to the earth surface as
a rain gush.

rapid projective measurements with equal time intervals being performed on the
system to check whether or not the system is in the initial state. These
projective measurements are selective measurements in the sense that the
measurement results are read out and only the case where all the measurement
results correspond to the initial state is considered in the analysis of the
effect of the measurements. In this paper, we extend such a treatment to
consider the effect of repeated non-selective measurements - only the final
measurement is required to correspond to the initial state, while we do not
know the results of the intermediate measurements. We present a general
formalism to derive the effective decay rate of the initial quantum state with
such non-selective measurements. Importantly, we show that there is a
difference between using non-selective measurements and the usual approach of
considering only selective measurements only if we go beyond the weak
system-environment coupling regime in models other than the usual population
decay models. As such, we then apply our formalism to investigate the quantum
Zeno and anti-Zeno effects for three exactly solvable system-environment
models: a single two-level system undergoing dephasing, a single two-level
system interacting with an environment of two-level systems, and a large spin
undergoing dephasing. Our results show that the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno
effects in the presence of non-selective measurements can differ very
significantly as compared to the repeated selective measurement scenario.

assume that a bag of sentences mentioning an entity pair are all describing a

largely suffers from the noisy labeling problem. In this paper, we propose a
novel model for relation classification at the sentence level from noisy data.
The model has two modules: an instance selector and a relation classifier. The
instance selector chooses high-quality sentences with reinforcement learning
and feeds the selected sentences into the relation classifier, and the relation
classifier makes sentence level prediction and provides rewards to the instance
selector. The two modules are trained jointly to optimize the instance
selection and relation classification processes. Experiment results show that
our model can deal with the noise of data effectively and obtains better
performance for relation classification at the sentence level.

users from the time and efforts for trip planning. It aims to recommend a
sequence of places of interest (POIs) for a user to visit that maximizes the
user's satisfaction. When adding a POI to a recommended trip, it is essential
to understand the context of the recommendation, including the POI popularity,
other POIs co-occurring in the trip, and the preferences of the user. These
contextual factors are learned separately in existing studies, while in
reality, they impact jointly on a user's choice of a POI to visit. In this
study, we propose a POI embedding model to jointly learn the impact of these
contextual factors. We call the learned POI embedding a context-aware POI
embedding. To showcase the effectiveness of this embedding, we apply it to
generate trip recommendations given a user and a time budget. We propose two
trip recommendation algorithms based on our context-aware POI embedding. The
first algorithm finds the exact optimal trip by transforming and solving the
trip recommendation problem as an integer linear programming problem. To
achieve a high computation efficiency, the second algorithm finds a
heuristically optimal trip based on adaptive large neighborhood search. We
perform extensive experiments on real datasets. The results show that our
proposed algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in trip
recommendation quality, with an advantage of up to 43% in F1-score.

intertwined: they tend to be consistent within areas of homogeneous appearance,
or regions, in the sense that all pixels within a roof should be classified as
roof, independently on the spatial support used for the classification. In this
paper, we follow these two observations and encode them as priors in an energy
minimization framework based on conditional random fields (CRFs), where
classification results obtained at pixel and region levels are
probabilistically fused. The aim is to enforce the final maps to be consistent
not only in their own spatial supports (pixel and region) but also across
supports, i.e., by getting the predictions on the pixel lattice and on the set
of regions to agree. To this end, we define an energy function with three
terms: 1) a data term for the individual elements in each support
(support-specific nodes); 2) spatial regularization terms in a neighborhood for
each of the supports (support-specific edges); and 3) a regularization term
between individual pixels and the region containing each of them (intersupports
edges). We utilize these priors in a unified energy minimization problem that
can be optimized by standard solvers. The proposed 2LCRF model consists of a
CRF defined over a bipartite graph, i.e., two interconnected layers within a
single graph accounting for interlattice connections.

While it is generally believed that the dielectric transition is related to the
freezing of the order-disorder dynamics of the dimethylammonium (DMA+) cation,
no quantitative data on this motion are available. We surmise that this is due

we previously obtained on l Car. The optical and infrared radial velocity
curves show the same amplitude (only about 3% of difference), with a slight
radial velocity shift of about 0.5 +/- 0.3 km s^-1 between the two curves.
Around the minimum radius (phase ~ 0.9) the visible radial velocity curve is
found in advance compared to the infrared one (phase lag), which is consistent
with an infrared line forming higher in the atmosphere (compared to the visible
line) and with a compression wave moving from the bottom to the top of the
atmosphere during maximum outward velocity. The asymmetry of the K-band line is
also found to be significantly different from that of the optical line.

between open sets of the finite direct product of the complex number field. On
the other hand, when A is a commutative Banach algebra, Lorch gave a definition
that an A-valued function on an open set of A is holomorphic. The definition of
a holomorphic function by Lorch can be straightforwardly generalized to an
A-valued function on an open set of the finite direct product of A. Therefore,
a manifold modeled on the finite direct product of A (an n-dimensional
A-manifold) is easily defined. However, in my opinion, it seems that so many
nontrivial examples were not known (including the case of n=1, that is, Riemann
surfaces).
  By the way, if X is a compact Hausdorff space, then the algebra C(X) of all
complex valued continuous functions on X is the most basic example of a
commutative Banach algebra (furthermore, a commutative C*-algebra). In this
note, we see that if the set of all continuous cross sections of a continuous
family M of compact complex manifolds (a topological deformation M of compact
complex analytic structures) on X is denoted by G(M), then the structure of a
C(X)-manifold modeled on the C(X)-modules of all continuous cross sections of
complex vector bundles on X is introduced into G(M). Therefore, especially, if
X is contractible, then G(M) is a finite-dimensional C(X)-manifold.

the unavailability of sparse read-out sensors suitable for high throughput

method is presented, by which the optimal solution can be found with
probability one. Generalized sufficient conditions, which are derived from the
parametrized Sard's theorem, are first developed. A new type of probability-one
homotopy formulation, which is custom-designed for solving minimum-time
low-thrust trajectory optimization problems and satisfies all these sufficient

initiated by an initial problem with known solution, the optimal solution of
the original problem is guaranteed to be solved with probability one. Numerical
demonstrations in a three-dimensional time-optimal low-thrust orbital transfer
problem with 43 revolutions is presented to illustrate the applications of the

diffusion parameter calibration procedure is required. The model provides quite
simple profit and loss (PnL) formula, with which we can easily understand where
a material PnL trend comes from when it appears, and consider how we should
modify the model parameters. The model has high flexibility to control the
model dynamics because parameter calibration is unnecessary and the model
parameters can be used solely for the purpose of the model dynamics control.
With the model, the position management of the exotic interest rate products,

systematic manner. A numerical experiment is performed to show the
effectiveness of the approach for a Canary swaption, which is a special form of

demonstrate that the average emitted radio power is proportional to the
Poynting flux from the rotating Jupiter's magnetosphere intercepted by the

appears to apply to all plasma interactions between a magnetized flow and an
obstacle, magnetized or not. Extrapolating this scaling law to the parameter
range corresponding to hot Jupiters, we predict large radio powers emitted by
these objects, that should result in detectable radio flux with new-generation
radiotelescopes. Comparing the distributions of the durations of
Ganymede-Jupiter and Io-Jupiter emission events also suggests that while the

orbital migration due to planet-disk interactions. When the first planet
reaches the inner edge of the disk its migration stops and the second planet is
locked in resonance. We detail the resonant trapping comparing semi-analytical
formulae and numerical simulations in the case of two equal-mass coplanar
planets trapped in first order resonances. We describe the family of resonant
stable equilibrium points (zero-amplitude libration orbits) using expanded and
non-expanded Hamiltonians. We show that during convergent migration the planets
evolve along these families of equilibria. Eccentricity damping from the disk
leads to a final equilibrium configuration that we predict analytically. The
fact that observed multi-exoplanetary systems are rarely seen in resonances
suggests that the resonant configurations achieved by migration can become
unstable after the removal of the disk. We probe the stability of the
resonances as a function of planetary mass. To do this, we fictitiously
increase the masses of the planets, adiabatically maintaining the low-amplitude
libration regime until instability. We discuss two hypotheses for instability:
low-order secondary resonance of the libration frequency with a fast synodic
frequency, and minimal approach distance between planets. We show that
secondary resonances do not seem to impact resonant systems at low-amplitude of
libration. Resonant systems are more stable than non-resonant ones for a given
minimal distance at close encounters, but we show that the latter still play
the decisive role in the destabilisation of resonant pairs. We show that, as
the planetary mass increases and the minimal distance between planets gets
smaller in terms of mutual Hill radius, the region of stability around the
resonance center shrinks, until the equilibrium point itself becomes unstable.

oscillations manifest as a periodic repopulation among these states, or

predictions are confirmed by considering two different models: a driven
harmonic oscillator and a Landau-Zener grid model. Both models indeed show

but its impact on the bandwidth of quantum emitters is typically disregarded.
Here, we theoretically demonstrate that there is an intermediate domain between
the usual weak and strong coupling regimes where the bandwidth of a quantum
emitter is directly related to the dispersion properties of the reactive power.
This result emphasizes that reactive power must be understood as an additional
degree of freedom in engineering the bandwidth of quantum emitters. We
illustrate the applicability of this concept by revisiting typical
configurations of quantum emitters coupled to resonant cavities and waveguides.
Analysis of the reactive power in these system unveils new functionalities,
including the design of effcient but narrowband photon sources, as well as
quantum emitters exhibiting a bandwidth narrower than its nonradiative

XENON1T, PICO and CRESST results. We calculate the cross section for inelastic
DM-nucleon scattering within an extension of the effective theory of DM-nucleon
interactions which applies to the case of inelastic DM models characterised by
a mass splitting between the incoming and outgoing DM particle. We find that
for values of the mass splitting parameter larger than about 200 keV, neutrino
telescopes place limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section which are
stronger than the ones from current DM direct detection experiments. The exact
mass splitting value for which this occurs depends on whether DM thermalises in
the Sun or not. This result applies to all DM-nucleon interactions that
generate DM-nucleus scattering cross sections which are independent of the
nuclear spin, including the ""canonical"" spin-independent interaction. We
explicitly perform our calculations for a DM candidate with mass of 1 TeV, but
our conclusions qualitatively also apply to different masses. Furthermore, we
find that exclusion limits from IceCube on the coupling constants of this

nuclear recoil energy. Our results should be taken into account in global

of the states before transmitting them. These output masks are local (i.e.,
implemented independently by each agent), deterministic, time-varying and
converging asymptotically to the true state. The resulting masked system is
also time-varying and has the original (unmasked) system as its limit system.
It is shown in the paper that the masked system has the original average
consensus value as a global attractor. However, in order to preserve privacy,
it cannot share an equilibrium point with the unmasked system, meaning that in
the masked system the global attractor cannot be also stable.

processes in the healthy and in the pathological brain.
  New method: We introduce the use of a Bayesian multi-dipole localization
method in the frequency domain. Given the Fourier Transform of the data at one
or multiple frequencies and/or trials, the algorithm approximates numerically
the posterior distribution with Monte Carlo techniques.
  Results: We use synthetic data to show that the proposed method behaves well
under a wide range of experimental conditions, including low signal-to-noise
ratios and correlated sources. We use dipole clusters to mimic the effect of
extended sources. In addition, we test the algorithm on real MEG data to
confirm its feasibility.
  Comparison with existing method(s): Throughout the whole study, DICS (Dynamic
Imaging of Coherent Sources) is used systematically as a benchmark. The two

populations: one which formed in-situ and one which comprises clusters tidally

contribution to the outer globular cluster population in the M31 galaxy through
donation of clusters from dwarf galaxies. We test this numerically by comparing
the contribution of globular clusters from simulated encounters to the observed
M31 globular cluster population. To constrain our simulations, we specifically
investigate the outermost globular cluster in the M31 system, MGC1. The remote
location of MGC1 favours the idea of it being captured, however, the cluster is
devoid of features associated with tidal interactions. Hence we separate
simulations where tidal features are present and where they are hidden. We find
that our simulated encounters can place clusters on MGC1-like orbits. In
addition, we find that tidal stripping of clusters from dwarf galaxies leaves
them on orbits having a range of separations, broadly matching those observed
in M31. We find that the specific energies of globular clusters captured by M31
closely matches those of the incoming host dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, in our
simulations we find an equal number of accreted clusters on co-rotating and
counter-rotating orbits within M31 and use this to infer the fraction of
clusters that has been accreted. We find that even close in roughly 50% of the

conditions, if the plasma is optically thick, the contribution of blackbody
radiation to the EOS is dominant, and the system becomes always stable. Our

  detection using deep learning with small dataset","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death worldwide with a
considerable economic burden on the health systems. In about 15% of strokes,
atherosclerotic carotid plaques (ACPs) constitute the main etiological factor.
Early detection of ACPs may have a key-role for preventing strokes by managing
the patient a-priory to the occurrence of the damage. ACPs can be detected on
panoramic images. As these are one of the most common images performed for
routine dental practice, they can be used as a source of available data for
computerized methods of automatic detection in order to significantly increase
timely diagnosis of ACPs. Recently, there has been a definite breakthrough in
the field of analysis of medical images due to the use of deep learning based
on neural networks. These methods, however have been barely used in dentistry.
In this study we used the Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster
R-CNN) for deep learning. We aimed to assess the operation of the algorithm on
a small database of 65 panoramic images. Due to a small amount of available
training data, we had to use data augmentation by changing the brightness and
randomly flipping and rotating cropped regions of interest in multiple angles.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the
accuracy of detection. ACP was detected with a sensitivity of 75%, specificity
of 80% and an accuracy of 83%. The ROC analysis showed a significant Area Under
Curve (AUC) difference from 0.5. Our novelty lies in that we have showed the
efficiency of the Faster R-CNN algorithm in detecting ACPs on routine panoramic
images based on a small database. There is a need to further improve the
application of the algorithm to the level of introducing this methodology in
routine dental practice in order to enable us to prevent stroke events.

generate k LDA topics and replicate this process n times resulting in n*k
topics. Then we use K-medioids to cluster the n*k topics to k clusters. The k

the spread of an epidemic on a configuration model network, in which
susceptible individuals may take preventive measures by dropping edges to
infectious neighbours. An effective degree formulation of the model is used in
conjunction with the theory of density dependent population processes to obtain
a law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for the epidemic
as the population size $N \to \infty$, assuming that the degrees of individuals
are bounded. A central limit theorem is conjectured for the final size of the
epidemic. The results are obtained for both the Molloy-Reed (in which the
degrees of individuals are deterministic) and Newman-Strogatz-Watts (in which
the degrees of individuals are independent and identically distributed)
versions of the configuration model. The two versions yield the same limiting
deterministic model but the asymptotic variances in the central limit theorema
are greater in the Newman-Strogatz-Watts version. The basic reproduction number
$R_0$ and the process of susceptible individuals in the limiting deterministic
model, for the model with dropping of edges, are the same as for a
corresponding SIR model without dropping of edges but an increased recovery
rate, though, when $R_0>1$, the probability of a major outbreak is greater in
the model with dropping of edges. The results are specialised to the model
without dropping of edges to yield conjectured central limit theorems for the
final size of Markovian SIR epidemics on configuration-model networks, and for
the giant components of those networks. The theory is illustrated by numerical
studies, which demonstrate that the asymptotic approximations are good, even

merger observed by the LIGO/VIRGO detectors have already put limits on the
tidal deformability and provided constraints on the ultra-high nuclear density
EOS. In view of this ground breaking discovery, we revisit and extend our
previous work [Phys. Rev. D 95, 101302(R) (2017)] which found that taking the
effect of elasticity into account in the calculation of the tidal deformability
of compact star models composed of crystalline color-superconducting (CCS)
quark matter can break the universal I-Love relation discovered for fluid
compact stars. In this paper, we present our formulation in detail and provide
more analysis to complement our previous findings. We focus and extend the
study of the screening effect on the tidal deformability, which we found
previously for hybrid star models, to various theoretical two-layer compact
star models. We show that the screening effect of these two-layer models in
general depends on the thickness of the envelope and the ratio between the
density gap and the core density at the core-envelope interface. However, for
models with a fluid envelope and a vanishing small density gap, the screening
effect remains strong even as the thickness of the envelops tends to zero if
the quark matter core has a fairly uniform density. The relevance of our study
to GW170817 is also discussed. Our study advocates that the tidal deformability
not only provides us information on the EOS, but may also give insights into
the multi-layer structure and elastic properties of compact star models

separability criterion to larger systems is not sufficient to make this
distinction (it constitutes a necessary condition of separability). A set of
additional conditions for the operators describing the evolution of the

commutation of these environmental operators with the initial state of the

commute among themselves for a pure dephasing evolution not to be accompanied

with respect to the single-qubit case, since it allows for a system to entangle

monoid, and symmetric group algebras. We give a construction of the irreducible
modules of these algebras in two isomorphic ways: first, as the span of
symmetric diagrams on which the algebra acts by conjugation twisted with an
irreducible symmetric group representation and, second, on a basis indexed by
set-partition tableaux such that diagrams in the algebra act combinatorially on
tableaux. The first representation is analogous to the Gelfand model and the
second is a generalization of Young's natural representation of the symmetric

the characters of each of these algebras as nonnegative integer combinations of
symmetric group characters whose coefficients count fixed points under

Solar dynamo models of Babcock-Leighton type typically assume the
rise of magnetic flux tubes to be instantaneous. Solutions with
high-magnetic-diffusivity have too short periods and a wrong migration of their
active belts. Only the low-diffusivity regime with advective meridional flows
is usually considered. Aims. In the present paper we discuss these assumptions
and applied a time delay in the source term of the azimuthally averaged
induction equation. This delay is set to be the rise time of magnetic flux
tubes which supposedly form at the tachocline. We study the effect of the
delay, which adds to the spacial non-locality a non-linear temporal one, in the
advective but particularly in the diffusive regime. Methods. Fournier et al.
(2017) obtained the rise time according to stellar parameters such as rotation,
and the magnetic field strength at the bottom of the convection zone. These
results allowed us to constrain the delay in the mean-field model used in a
parameter study. Results. We identify an unknown family of solutions. These
solutions self-quench, and exhibit longer periods than their non-delayed
counterparts. Additionally, we demonstrate that the non-linear delay is
responsible for the recover of the equatorward migration of the active belts at
high turbulent diffusivities. Conclusions. By introducing a non-linear temporal
non-locality (the delay) in a Babcock-Leighton dynamo model, we could obtain
solutions quantitatively comparable to the solar butterfly diagram in the
diffusion-dominated regime.

inference from time series data has recently been a focus area of systems
biology. Due to low sampling frequency of the data, this is a notoriously
difficult problem. We tackle the challenge by introducing the so-called
continuous-time Gaussian process dynamical model, based on Gaussian process
framework that has gained popularity in nonlinear regression problems arising
in machine learning. The model dynamics are governed by a stochastic
differential equation, where the dynamics function is modelled as a Gaussian

differential equation. We derive the probability distribution for the Euler
discretised trajectories and establish the convergence of the discretisation.
We develop a GRN inference method called BINGO, based on the developed
framework. BINGO is based on MCMC sampling of trajectories of the GPDM and
estimating the hyperparameters of the covariance function of the Gaussian
process. Using benchmark data examples, we show that BINGO is superior in
dealing with poor time resolution and it is computationally feasible.

consistent with observed parameters in most period bins at both optical and

decrease with increase in wavelength while the Fourier phase parameters
increase with wavelength at a given period. We use absolute magnitudes for a

of period-color relation at minimum light is very shallow or flat and becomes
increasingly significant at the maximum light for RRab stars. We also find that

this constraint hold over an exponentially or infinitely large collection of

an algorithm guaranteed to learn subject to this constraint, under the

fairness is a concern, we investigate the basic convergence of the algorithm

recent algorithm of Agarwal et al. [2018], which implements weaker and more
traditional marginal fairness constraints defined by individual protected
attributes. We find that in general, the Kearns et al. algorithm converges
quickly, large gains in fairness can be obtained with mild costs to accuracy,
and that optimizing accuracy subject only to marginal fairness leads to
classifiers with substantial subgroup unfairness. We also provide a number of
analyses and visualizations of the dynamics and behavior of the Kearns et al.
algorithm. Overall we find this algorithm to be effective on real data, and
rich subgroup fairness to be a viable notion in practice.

TSR in regard to defect detection. This motivated us to explore state profiles,
which are based on the collective values of program variables. This paper
presents Substate Profiling, a new form of state profiling that enhances
existing profile-based analysis techniques such as TSR and coverage-based fault
localization. Compared to current approaches for capturing program states,
Substate Profiling is more practical and finer grained. We evaluated our
approach using thirteen multi-fault subject programs comprising 53 defects. Our
study involved greedy TSR using Substate profiles and four structural profiles,
namely, basic-block, branch, def-use pair, and the combination of the three.
For the majority of the subjects, Substate Profiling detected considerably more

found to be complementary to structural profiles in many cases, thus, combining
both types is beneficial.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed
magnetotransport properties, yet without arriving to definitive conclusions or
portraying a global picture. In this work, we investigate the transverse
magnetoresistance of materials by combining the Fermi surfaces calculated from
first principles with the Boltzmann transport theory approach relying on the
semiclassical model and the relaxation time approximation. We first consider a
series of simple model Fermi surfaces to provide a didactic introduction into
the charge-carrier compensation and open-orbit mechanisms leading to
non-saturating magnetoresistance. We then address in detail magnetotransport in
three representative materials: (i) copper, a prototypical nearly free-electron
metal characterized by the open Fermi surface that results in an intricate
angular magnetoresistance, (ii) bismuth, a topologically trivial semimetal in
which very large magnetoresistance is known to result from charge-carrier
compensation, and (iii) tungsten diphosphide WP2, a recently discovered type-II
Weyl semimetal that holds the record of magnetoresistance in compounds. In all
three cases our calculations show excellent agreement with both the field
dependence of magnetoresistance and its anisotropy measured at low
temperatures. Furthermore, the calculations allow for a full interpretation of
the observed features in terms of the Fermi surface topology. These results
will help addressing a number of outstanding questions, such as the role of the
topological phase in the pronounced large non-saturating magnetoresistance
observed in topological materials.

difficult for computers but easy for humans. However, since the answers
collected from the recruited participants (workers) may contain sensitive
information, crowdsourcing raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of protecting answer privacy under local differential
privacy (LDP), by which individual workers randomize their answers
independently and send the perturbed answers to the task requester. The utility
goal is to enable to infer the true answer (i.e., truth) from the perturbed
data with high accuracy. One of the challenges of LDP perturbation is the
sparsity of worker answers (i.e., each worker only answers a small number of
tasks). Simple extension of the existing approaches (e.g., Laplace perturbation
and randomized response) may incur large error of truth inference on sparse
data. Thus we design an efficient new matrix factorization (MF) algorithm under
LDP. We prove that our MF algorithm can provide both LDP guarantee and small
error of truth inference, regardless of the sparsity of worker answers. We
perform extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, and
demonstrate that the MF algorithm performs better than the existing LDP
algorithms on sparse crowdsourcing data.

sub-Neptune orbiting a quiet G9V star. Using K2 data from campaigns C5 and C16,
we find this planet to have a period of $50.818947\pm 0.000094$ days and a
radius of $2.41\pm0.12$ R$_{\oplus}$. We followed this system with HARPS-N to
obtain 67 precise radial velocities. A combined fit of the transit and radial
velocity data reveals that K2-263b has a mass of $14.8\pm3.1$ M$_{\oplus}$. Its
bulk density ($5.7_{-1.4}^{+1.6}$ g cm$^{-3}$) implies that this planet has a
significant envelope of water or other volatiles around a rocky core.
EPIC211682544b likely formed in a similar way as the cores of the four giant
planets in our own Solar System, but for some reason, did not accrete much gas.
The planetary mass was confirmed by an independent Gaussian process-based fit
to both the radial velocities and the spectroscopic activity indicators.
K2-263b belongs to only a handful of confirmed K2 exoplanets with periods
longer than 40 days. It is among the longest periods for a small planet with a
precisely determined mass using radial velocities.

is constant across the entire covariate domain. However, in many applications,
there is interest in considering the possibility that the covariate of main
interest is subject to a threshold effect: a change in the slope at a certain
point within the covariate domain. Often, the value of this threshold is
unknown and need to be estimated. In addition, often, the covariate of interest
is not measured exactly, but rather is subject to some degree of measurement
error. In this paper, we discuss estimation of the model parameters under an
independent additive error model where the covariate of interesting is measured
with error and the potential threshold value in this covariate is unknown. As
in earlier work which discussed the case of konwn threshold, we study the
performance of several bias correction methods: two versions of regression
calibration (RC1 and RC2), two versions of the fitting a model for the induced
relative risk (RR1 and RR2), maximum pseudo-partial likelihood estimator
(MPPLE) and simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX). These correction methods are
compared with the naive estimator. We develop the relevant theory, present a
simulation study comparing the several correction methods, and illustrate the
use of the bias correction methods in data from the Nurses Health Study (NHS)
concerning the relationship between chronic air pollution exposure to
particulate matter of diameter 10 $\mu$m or less (PM$_{10}$). The simulation
results suggest that the best overall choice of bias correction method is
either the RR2 method or the MPPLE method.

fermions at hot spots evolve into a non-Fermi-liquid. In the

models, taking into account the stylized facts of return data. The common
problem is that the latent parameters of many volatility models are
high-dimensional and analytically intractable, which means inferences require
approximations using, for example, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Laplace
methods. Some SV models are expressed as a linear Gaussian state-space model
that leads to a marginal likelihood, reducing the dimensionality of the
problem. Others are not linearized, and the latent parameters are integrated
out. However, these present a quite restrictive evolution equation. Thus, we
propose a Bayesian GED-Gamma SV model with a direct marginal likelihood that is
a product of the generalized Student's t-distributions in which the latent
states are related across time through a stationary Gaussian evolution
equation. Then, an approximation is made for the prior distribution of
log-precision/volatility, without the need for model linearization. This also
allows for the computation of the marginal likelihood function, where the
high-dimensional latent states are integrated out and easily sampled in blocks
using a smoothing procedure. In addition, extensions of our GED-Gamma model are
easily made to incorporate skew heavy-tailed distributions. We use the Bayesian
estimator for the inference of static parameters, and perform a simulation
study on several properties of the estimator. Our results show that the
proposed model can be reasonably estimated. Furthermore, we provide case
studies of a Brazilian asset and the pound/dollar exchange rate to show the
performance of our approach in terms of fit and prediction.

In this work, a new metrology based on asymmetric beam time-domain

anisotropic thermal transport by extending the conventional TDTR technique.
Using an elliptical laser beam with controlled elliptical ratio and spot size,
the experimental signals can be exploited to be dominantly sensitive to measure
thermal conductivity along the cross-plane or any specific in-plane directions.
An analytic solution for a multi-layer system is derived for the AB-TDTR signal
in response to the periodical pulse, elliptical laser beam, and heating
geometry, to extract the anisotropic thermal conductivity from experimental
measurement. Examples with experimental data are given for various materials
with in-plane thermal conductivity from 5 W/mK to 2000W/mK, including isotropic
materials (silicon, boron phosphide, boron nitride), transversely isotropic
materials (graphite, quartz, sapphire) and transversely anisotropic materials

to guide the optimal setting of experimental configurations for different
materials. The developed AB-TDTR metrology provides a new approach to
accurately measure anisotropic thermal phenomena for rational materials design
