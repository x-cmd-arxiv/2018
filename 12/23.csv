  Distribution Matching","Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of training speech recognition systems without using
any labeled data, under the assumption that the learner can only access to the
input utterances and a phoneme language model estimated from a non-overlapping
corpus. We propose a fully unsupervised learning algorithm that alternates
between solving two sub-problems: (i) learn a phoneme classifier for a given
set of phoneme segmentation boundaries, and (ii) refining the phoneme
boundaries based on a given classifier. To solve the first sub-problem, we
introduce a novel unsupervised cost function named Segmental Empirical Output
Distribution Matching, which generalizes the work in (Liu et al., 2017) to
segmental structures. For the second sub-problem, we develop an approximate MAP
approach to refining the boundaries obtained from Wang et al. (2017).
Experimental results on TIMIT dataset demonstrate the success of this fully
unsupervised phoneme recognition system, which achieves a phone error rate
(PER) of 41.6%. Although it is still far away from the state-of-the-art
supervised systems, we show that with oracle boundaries and matching language
model, the PER could be improved to 32.5%.This performance approaches the
supervised system of the same model architecture, demonstrating the great
potential of the proposed method.

  Embedding and Clustering",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Taxonomy construction is not only a fundamental task for semantic analysis of
text corpora, but also an important step for applications such as information
filtering, recommendation, and Web search. Existing pattern-based methods
extract hypernym-hyponym term pairs and then organize these pairs into a
taxonomy. However, by considering each term as an independent concept node,
they overlook the topical proximity and the semantic correlations among terms.
In this paper, we propose a method for constructing topic taxonomies, wherein
every node represents a conceptual topic and is defined as a cluster of
semantically coherent concept terms. Our method, TaxoGen, uses term embeddings
and hierarchical clustering to construct a topic taxonomy in a recursive
fashion. To ensure the quality of the recursive process, it consists of: (1) an
adaptive spherical clustering module for allocating terms to proper levels when
splitting a coarse topic into fine-grained ones; (2) a local embedding module
for learning term embeddings that maintain strong discriminative power at
different levels of the taxonomy. Our experiments on two real datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of TaxoGen compared with baseline methods.

cyanobacteria over unsettled green algae in a wastewater treatment system,
evaluating for the first time the effect of hydraulic regimes on nutritional
dynamics and microorganisms competition. During 30 days of operation, an
initial microalgae mixed consortia dominated by the green microalgae
Scenedesmus sp. was cultivated in two different photo-sequencing batch reactors
operated at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 days (PSBR6) and 4 days (PSBR4)
at a theoretical solids retention time (SRT) of 10 d. Both reactors were
compared with a semi-continuous reactor (SC10) operated at 10 d of HRT and 10
days of SRT (used as a control). The results indicated that PSBR6 and PSBR4
decreased Scenedesmus sp. population by 88% and 48%, respectively. However,
only PSBR6 provided suitable conditions to select cyanobacteria from an initial
green algae dominated culture. These conditions included volumetric loads of
11.72 mg TN L-1d-1, 2.04 mg TP L-1d-1 and 53.31 mg TOC L-1d-1. The remaining
nutrients in the culture led also to a phosphorus limiting N:P ratio (34:1)
that improved the increase of cyanobacteria from an initial 2% until 70% of the
total population. In addition, PSBR6 reached a biomass production of 0.12 g
L-1d-1, while removing TN, TP and TOC by 58%, 83% and 85%, respectively.
Conversely, the application of higher nutrients loads caused by lower HRT
(PSBR4) led to an increase of only 13% of cyanobacteria while SC10 remained
with the same biomass composition during all the experimental time. Thus, this
study showed that the dominance of cyanobacteria in microalgal based wastewater
treatment systems can be controlled by the operational and nutritional
conditions. This knowledge could contribute to control microalgae contamination
from up-scaling cyanobacterial biomass production in wastewater treatment
systems.

locally-linear approximation error.
  Methods: Data acquisition was accomplished with use of an 2D radially sampled

environments. For example, a population of organisms may express the same
phenotype in all environments (`unvarying strategy'), or follow environmental
cues and express alternative phenotypes to match the environment (`tracking
strategy'), or diversify into coexisting phenotypes to cope with environmental
uncertainty (`bet-hedging strategy'). We introduce a general framework for
studying how organisms respond to environmental variations, which models an
adaptation strategy by an abstract mapping from environmental cues to
phenotypic traits. Depending on the accuracy of environmental cues and the
strength of natural selection, we find different adaptation strategies
represented by mappings that maximize the longterm growth rate of a population.
The previously studied strategies emerge as special cases of our model: the
tracking strategy is favorable when environmental cues are accurate, whereas
when cues are noisy, organisms can either use an unvarying strategy or,
remarkably, use the uninformative cue as a source of randomness to bet-hedge.
Our model of the environment-to-phenotype mapping is based on a network with
hidden units; the performance of the strategies is shown to rely on having a
high-dimensional internal representation, which can even be random.

neglects the inherent temporal correlation of the EUC behaviors, and may result

Re-Identification (ReID) methods have improved considerably. However, most of
the work in this area has dealt with videos acquired by fixed cameras with
wider field of view. Recently, widespread use of wearable cameras and recording
devices such as cellphones have opened the door to interesting research in
first-person Point-of-view (POV) videos (egocentric videos). Nonetheless,
analysis of such videos is challenging due to factors such as poor video
quality due to ego-motion, blurriness, severe changes in lighting conditions
and perspective distortions. To facilitate the research towards conquering
these challenges, this paper contributes a new dataset called EgoReID. The
dataset is captured using 3 mobile cellphones with non-overlapping
field-of-view. It contains 900 IDs and around 10,200 tracks with a total of
176,000 detections. The dataset also contains 12-sensor meta data e.g. camera
orientation pitch and rotation for each video.
  In addition, we propose a new framework which takes advantage of both visual
and sensor meta data to successfully perform Person ReID. We extend image-based
re-ID method employing human body parsing trained on ten datasets to
video-based re-ID. In our method, first frame level local features are
extracted for each semantic region, then 3D convolutions are applied to encode
the temporal information in each sequence of semantic regions. Additionally, we
employ sensor meta data to predict targets' next camera and their estimated

communications and radar. Since there are so many parameters in this
environment that are changing continuously in the spatial and temporal domains
such as weather and sea surface parameters. Hence, accurately modeling the
over-water propagation channel is very crucial and challenging at the same
time. In this report, we will shed some light on the parabolic equation (PE)
method which is one of the main methods used to model the radio waves
propagation over variable terrain and through the homogeneous and inhomogeneous
atmosphere. Besides ray-tracing, PE is among the most widely used approaches
nowadays for deterministically analyze over-water channels. We are trying to
pave the way for better understanding of the mathematical background for the PE
and develop a tool to perform advanced analysis for the over-water
communication channel taking into consideration its spatial and temporal
behavior.

  (Santa Fe press)",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interest in the thermodynamics of computation has revived in recent years,
driven by developments in science, economics and technology. Given the
consequences of the growing demand for computational power, the idea of
reducing the energy cost of computations has gained new importance.
Simultaneously, many biological networks are now interpreted as
information-processing or computational systems constrained by their underlying
thermodynamics. Indeed, some suggest that low-cost, high-density biological
systems may help to mitigate the rising demand for computational power and the
""end"" of Moore's law of exponential growth in the density of transistors.
  In this chapter we address widespread misconceptions about thermodynamics and
the thermodynamics of computation. In particular, we will argue against the
general perception that a measurement or copy operation can be performed at no
cost, against the emphasis placed on the significance of erasure operations,
and against the careless discussion of heat and work. While not universal,
these misconceptions are sufficiently prevalent (particularly within
interdisciplinary contexts) to warrant a detailed discussion. In the process,
we will argue that explicitly representing fundamental processes is a useful
tool, serving to demystify key concepts.
  We first give a brief overview of thermodynamics, then the history of the
thermodynamics of computation - particularly in terms of copy and measurement
operations inherent to classic thought experiments. Subsequently, we analyse
these ideas via an explicit biochemical representation of the entire cycle of
Szilard's engine. In doing so we show that molecular computation is both a
promising engineering paradigm, and a valuable tool in providing fundamental
understanding.

theory of coherent electron transport from a tunneling tip into a Corbino

While the MBSs rotate, electron tunneling happens from the tip to one of the
MBSs thereby changing the fermion parity of the MBSs. The tunneling events in
combination with the rotation allow us to identify a novel braiding operator
that does not commute with the braiding cycles in the absence of tunneling,
revealing the non-Abelian nature of MBSs. The time-averaged tunneling current
exhibits resonances as a function of the tip voltage with a period that is a
direct consequence of the interference between the non-commuting braiding
operations. Our work opens up a possibility for utilizing parity non-conserving
processes to control non-Abelian states.

the asymptotic form $f(\nu\to0)\sim\nu^a$ and $f(|\nu|\to\infty)\sim\nu^b$ with
arbitrary real $a>b$. Furthermore, we prove that the numerical transform
converges exponentially fast in the number of data points, provided that the

opening angle $\theta$ around the real axis and satisfies
$|f(\nu)f(1/\nu)|<\nu^c$ as $\nu\to 0$ with a positive constant $c$, which is
the case for the class of functions with power-law tails. Based on these

logarithmic Fourier transform can be applied to convolutions. The ability of
the logarithmic Fourier transform to perform these operations on multiscale

long tail extending into higher values of 1.5 - 2 km/s/pc, and is generally

population size estimation, particularly in the quantitative study of human
rights violations. These methods rely on multiple samples from the population,
along with the information of which individuals appear in which samples. The
goal of record linkage techniques is to identify unique individuals across
samples based on the information collected on them. Linkage decisions are
subject to uncertainty when such information contains errors and missingness,
and when different individuals have very similar characteristics. Uncertainty
in the linkage should be propagated into the stage of population size
estimation. We propose an approach called linkage-averaging to propagate
linkage uncertainty, as quantified by some Bayesian record linkage
methodologies, into a subsequent stage of population size estimation.
Linkage-averaging is a two-stage approach in which the results from the record
linkage stage are fed into the population size estimation stage. We show that
under some conditions the results of this approach correspond to those of a
proper Bayesian joint model for both record linkage and population size
estimation. The two-stage nature of linkage-averaging allows us to combine
different record linkage models with different capture-recapture models, which
facilitates model exploration. We present a case study from the Salvadoran
civil war, where we are interested in estimating the total number of civilian
killings using lists of witnesses' reports collected by different
organizations. These lists contain duplicates, typographical and spelling
errors, missingness, and other inaccuracies that lead to uncertainty in the
linkage. We show how linkage-averaging can be used for transferring the
uncertainty in the linkage of these lists into different models for population
size estimation.

However, conventional oxygen absorption spectroscopy fails to distinguish the
critical oxygen chemistry in oxide-based battery electrodes. Therefore,
high-efficiency full-range mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
(mRIXS) has been developed as a reliable probe of oxygen redox reactions. Here,
based on mRIXS results collected from a series of Li1.17Ni0.21Co0.08Mn0.54O2
electrodes at different electrochemical states and its comparison with
peroxides, we provide a comprehensive analysis of five components observed in
the mRIXS results. While almost all the components change upon electrochemical
cycling, comparison with peroxide species show that only two evolving features
correspond to the critical oxidized oxygen states. One is a specific feature at
531.0eV excitation and 523.7eV emission energy, the other is a low-energy loss
feature. We show that both features evolve with electrochemical cycling of
Li1.17Ni0.21Co0.08Mn0.54O2 electrodes, and could be used for characterizing
oxygen redox states in battery electrodes. This work is the first benchmark for
a complete assignment of all the important mRIXS features collected from
battery materials, which provides guidelines for future studies in
characterization, analysis and theoretical calculation for probing and
understanding oxygen redox reactions.

surface states. Their magnetic doping breaks time-reversal symmetry and
generates numerous interesting effects such as dissipationless transport.
Nonetheless, their dynamical properties are still poorly understood. Here, we
perform a systematic investigation of transverse spin excitations of $3d$ and
$4d$ single impurities embedded in two prototypical topological insulators
(Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$). The impurity-induced states within the bulk
gap of the topological insulators are found to have a drastic impact on the
spin excitation spectra, resulting in very high lifetimes reaching up to
${microseconds}$. An intuitive picture of the spin dynamics is obtained by
mapping onto a generalized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenological model. The
first quantity extracted from this mapping procedure is the magnetic anisotropy
energy, which is then compared to the one provided by the magnetic force
theorem. This uncovers some difficulties encountered with the latter, which can
provide erroneous results for impurities with a high density of states at the
Fermi energy. Moreover, the Gilbert damping and nutation tensors are obtained.
The nutation effects can lead to a non-negligible shift in the spin excitation
resonance in the high-frequency regime. Finally, we study the impact of the
surface state on the spin dynamics, which may be severely altered due to the
repositioning of the impurity-induced state in comparison to the bulk case. Our
systematic investigation of this series of magnetic impurities sheds light on
their spin dynamics within topological insulators, with implications for
available and future experimental studies as, for instance, on the viability of
using such impurities for solid-state qubits.

Hereby, input signals from voltage and current measurements and output signals

mixing processes at the WD surface: convection, gravitational sedimentation,
overshoot, and thermohaline instability. We present MESA WD models that explore
each of these processes and their implications for inferred accretion rates. We
provide diffusion timescales for many individual metals, and we quantify the
regimes in which thermohaline mixing dominates over gravitational sedimentation
in setting the effective settling rate of the heavy elements. We build upon and
confirm earlier work finding that accretion rates as high as $10^{13} \, \rm g

planetesimal material accreted over a WD lifetime may be as high as $10^{28} \,

uncertainties about the nature of disk processes that supply accretion to the

the comparison of numerically evaluated spin and Raman response with

demonstration of soliton mode locking, the photorefractive effect enables mode
locking to self-start and soliton switching to occur bi-directionally.
Second-harmonic generation of the soliton spectrum is also observed, an
essential step for comb self-referencing. The Raman shock time constant of
lithium niobate is also determined by measurement of soliton
self-frequency-shift. Besides the considerable technical simplification
provided by a self-starting soliton system, these demonstrations, together with
the electro-optic and piezoelectric properties of lithium niobate, open the

for their ability to generate highly robust spatiotemporal activity patterns in
various experimental conditions. These include neuronal avalanches satisfying
the power scaling law and thereby exemplifying self-organized criticality in
living systems. A crucial question is how these patterns can be explained and
modeled in a way that is biologically meaningful, mathematically tractable and
yet broad enough to account for neuronal heterogeneity and complexity. Here we
propose a simple model which may offer an answer to this question. Our
derivations are based on just few phenomenological observations concerning
input-output behavior of an isolated neuron. A distinctive feature of the model
is that at the simplest level of description it comprises of only two
variables, a network activity variable and an exogenous variable corresponding
to energy needed to sustain the activity and modulate the efficacy of signal
transmission. Strikingly, this simple model is already capable of explaining
emergence of network spikes and bursts in developing neuronal cultures. The
model behavior and predictions are supported by empirical observations and
published experimental evidence on cultured neurons behavior exposed to oxygen
and energy deprivation. At the larger, network scale, introduction of the
energy-dependent regulatory mechanism enables the network to balance on the
edge of the network percolation transition. Network activity in this state
shows population bursts satisfying the scaling avalanche conditions. This
network state is self-sustainable and represents a balance between global
network-wide processes and spontaneous activity of individual elements.

  for Accurate In Vivo Dosimetry in HDR Brachytherapy",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since large dose are administrated to the patient in brachytherapy treatment,
ensuring the right dose is delivered is highly critical. This study presents a
first step in solving the standing issue of accurately knowing the dosimeter
position at all time during in vivo dosimetry. In this work, an energy
independent dosimeter, namely plastic scintillation detector, is coupled to an
electromagnetic (EM) sensor having sub-mm positional accuracy for real-time
tracking of the dosimeter position. However, adding an EM sensor adds materials
in the path to the scintillator and thus could potentially perturb the dose
measurements.To confirm the perturbation presence, 4 different sensors were
placed in front of the scintillator so the radiation does not arrive to it
directly. Variation of the distance between the sensor and the scintillator was
used to quantify the effect on the signal at 0{\deg} and 90{\deg}.To test the
dependence for each sensor, the signal measurement were taken from 0{\deg} to
90{\deg} with 10${\deg}$ increment. The 5PCBDOF sensor showed an increased
signal of almost $20{\%}$ with increasing beam angle. Sensor 5DOF, 5DOFthin and
6DOFshowed no significant angle dependance.The 6DOF and 5DOFthin sensor's cable
revealed no extra signal attenuation. The latter gives a smaller overall
attenuation. Therefore, the 5DOFthin is chosen to be part of the novel
dosimeter construction. It has a jitter error of $\pm$ 0.06 mm and a
reproductibility of$ {\pm}$ 0.008 mm. In the optimal operating range, the
average positional uncertainty is less than 0.2 mm. Average angle errors are at
most of 1.1${\deg}$. It is feasible to integrate an EM tracking sensor to an
energy independent plastic scintillation dosimeter with minimal impact to the
collected signal as well as sufficient positional accuracy to keep dose
uncertainty below 5${\%}$.

the low storage capacity of conventional dielectric materials. To mitigate this
issue, antiferroelectric materials have been proposed, but relatively few
families of antiferroelectric materials have been identified to date. Here, we
propose a new design strategy for the construction of lead-free
antiferroelectric materials using interfacial electrostatic engineering. We
begin with a ferroelectric material with one of the highest known bulk
polarizations, BiFeO3. We show that by confining atomically-precise thin layers
of BiFeO3 in a dielectric matrix that we can induce a metastable
antiferroelectric structure. Application of an electric field reversibly
switches between this new phase and a ferroelectric state, in addition, tuning
of the dielectric layer causes coexistence of the ferroelectric and
antiferroelectric states. Precise engineering of the structure generates an
antiferroelectric phase with energy storage comparable to that of the best
lead-based materials. The use of electrostatic confinement provides a new
pathway for the design of engineered antiferroelectric materials with large and
potentially coupled responses.

representations act on $L^2(\mathbf{H}_n)$. Our approach is inspired by the
connection between the harmonic oscillator on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the sum of
squares in the first stratum of $\mathbf{H}_n$ in the sense that we define the
harmonic oscillator on $\mathbf{H}_n$ as the image of the sub-Laplacian
$\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}}$ under the generic unitary irreducible
representation $\pi$ of the Dynin-Folland group which has formal dimension
$d_\pi = 1$. This approach, more generally, permits us to define a large class
of so-called anharmonic oscillators by employing positive Rockland operators on
$\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}$. By using the methods developed in ter Elst and Robinson
[tERo], we obtain spectral estimates for the harmonic and anharmonic
oscillators on $\mathbf{H}_n$. Moreover, we show that our approach extends to
graded $SI/Z$-groups of central dimension $1$, i.e., graded groups which
possess unitary irreducible representations which are square-integrable modulo
the $1$-dimensional center $Z(G)$. The latter part of the article is concerned
with spectral multipliers. By combining ter Elst and Robinson's techniques with
recent results in [AkRu18], we obtain useful
$L^\mathbf{p}$-$L^\mathbf{q}$-estimates for spectral multipliers of the
sub-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}}$ and, in fact more generally, of
general Rockland operators on general graded groups. As a by-product, we
recover the Sobolev embeddings on graded groups established in [FiRu17], and

a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood, which implies that they will in
principle overfit the training data when provided with a sufficiently
expressive decoder. In the limit of an infinite capacity decoder, the optimal
generative model is a uniform mixture over the training data. More generally,
an optimal decoder should output a weighted average over the examples in the
training data, where the magnitude of the weights is determined by the
proximity in the latent space. This leads to the hypothesis that, for a
sufficiently high capacity encoder and decoder, the VAE decoder will perform
nearest-neighbor matching according to the coordinates in the latent space. To
test this hypothesis, we investigate generalization on the MNIST dataset. We
consider both generalization to new examples of previously seen classes, and
generalization to the classes that were withheld from the training set. In both

hazing, random noise, and compression has been investigated for decades.
However, image degradations in practice are often a mixture of several types of
degradation. Such compositional degradations complicate restoration because
they require the differentiation of different degradation types and levels. In
this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for
estimating the degradation properties of a given degraded image. Furthermore,
we introduce an image restoration CNN model that adopts the estimated

can restore degraded images by exploiting the estimated degradation properties

definitively known. Prevailing theories are broadly classified as either Zeeman
or non-Zeeman in origin, the latter including effects such as anisotropic
pumping or anisotropic resonant scattering. The predicted behavior of the
linear and circular polarization fractions and electric vector position angle
vary by theory. In particular, individual maser features that exhibit a
rotation in linear polarization of $\sim \pi/2$ as a function of frequency over
their extent can be utilized as a test of several maser polarization transport
theories. In this paper, we analyze one SiO ($\nu=1$, $J=1-0$) maser feature
toward the Mira variable, TX Cam that exhibits this internal polarization
rotation and persists across five epochs (spanning $\sim3$ months). We compare
our results to the predictions by several maser polarization theories and find
that the linear polarization across the feature is consistent with a geometric
effect for a saturated maser originating when the angle between the projected
magnetic field and the line of sight ($\theta$) crosses the Van Vleck angle
$\theta_F \sim 55^{\circ}$. However, the electric vector position angle (EVPA)
exhibits a smooth rotation across the spatial extent of the feature rather than
the expected abrupt $\pi/2$ flip. We discuss possible explanations for this
discrepancy and alternative theories. Circular polarization across the feature
is also analyzed and it is the most accurately described by Zeeman effects
giving rise to a circular polarization fraction of the form $m_c$ is
approximately proportional to $\cos \theta$.

attacks, which are crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to
inputs in order that a neural-network-based classifier incorrectly labels them.
In particular, L0 AEs are a category of widely discussed threats where
adversaries are restricted in the number of pixels that they can corrupt.
However, our observation is that, while L0 attacks modify as few pixels as
possible, they tend to cause large-amplitude perturbations to the modified
pixels. We consider this as an inherent limitation of L0 AEs, and thwart such
attacks by both detecting and rectifying them. The main novelty of the proposed
detector is that we convert the AE detection problem into a comparison problem
by exploiting the inherent limitation of L0 attacks. More concretely, given an
image I, it is pre-processed to obtain another image I' . A Siamese network,
which is known to be effective in comparison, takes I and I' as the input pair
to determine whether I is an AE. A trained Siamese network automatically and
precisely captures the discrepancies between I and I' to detect L0
perturbations. In addition, we show that the pre-processing technique,
inpainting, used for detection can also work as an effective defense, which has
a high probability of removing the adversarial influence of L0 perturbations.
Thus, our system, called AEPECKER, demonstrates not only high AE detection
accuracies, but also a notable capability to correct the classification
results.

Bell on the original EPR paradox.The present paper discusses whether the CGLMP
(Bell) inequalities are possible tests for showing that quantum theory is not
underpinned by local hidden variable theory (LHVT). It is found by applying
Fine's theorem that the CGLMP approach involves a LHVT for the joint
probabilities associated with the measurement of one observable from each of
the two sub-systems, even though the underlying probabilities for joint
measurements of all four observables may involve a non-local HVT. The latter
HVT probabilities involve simultaneous measurements of observables
corresponding to non-commuting quantum operators - allowable in classical
theory. Although the CGLMP inequalities involve probabilities for measurements
of one observable per sub-system and are compatible with the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, there is no unambiguous quantum measurement process
linked to the probabilities in the CGLMP inequalities, and these quantum
measurements each have different probabilities. However, violation of a CGLMP
inequality based on any one of the possible quantum measurement sequences is
sufficient to show that the Collins et al LHVT predicts different results to
quantum theory. This occurs for a state considered in their paper - though for
observables whose physical interpretation is unclear. In spite of this issue
and in spite of the contextuality loophole, it is concluded that the CGLMP
inequalities are indeed suitable for ruling out both local (and non-local)
hidden variable theories. The state involved could apply to a macroscopic
system, so the CGLMP Bell inequalities are important for finding cases of
macroscopic violations of Bell locality. Possible experiments in double-well
Bose condensates for atoms with two hyperfine components are discussed.

viruses, binary code analysis is indispensable for many tasks, such as code
plagiarism detection and malware analysis. Today, source code is very often
compiled for various architectures, making cross-architecture binary code
analysis increasingly important. A binary, after being disassembled, is
expressed in an assembly languages. Thus, recent work starts exploring Natural
Language Processing (NLP) inspired binary code analysis. In NLP, words are
usually represented in high-dimensional vectors (i.e., embeddings) to
facilitate further processing, which is one of the most common and critical
steps in many NLP tasks. We regard instructions as words in NLP-inspired binary
code analysis, and aim to represent instructions as embeddings as well.
  To facilitate cross-architecture binary code analysis, our goal is that
similar instructions, regardless of their architectures, have embeddings close
to each other. To this end, we propose a joint learning approach to generating
instruction embeddings that capture not only the semantics of instructions
within an architecture, but also their semantic relationships across
architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on building
cross-architecture instruction embedding model. As a showcase, we apply the
model to resolving one of the most fundamental problems for binary code
similarity comparison---semantics-based basic block comparison, and the
solution outperforms the code statistics based approach. It demonstrates that
it is promising to apply the model to other cross-architecture binary code
analysis tasks.

$F\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{Set}$ on a category $\mathcal{A}$ is a coproduct
of representables precisely when each connected component of $F$'s category of
elements has an initial object. Most often, this condition is imposed on a
copresheaf of the form $\mathcal{B}\left(X,T-\right)$ for a functor
$T\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$, in which case this property says that $T$
admits generic factorizations at $X$, or equivalently that $T$ is familial at
$X$.
  Here we generalize these results to the two-dimensional setting, replacing
$\mathcal{A}$ with an arbitrary bicategory $\mathscr{A}$, and $\mathbf{Set}$
with $\mathbf{Cat}$. In this two-dimensional setting, simply asking that a
pseudofunctor $F\colon\mathscr{A}\to\mathbf{Cat}$ be a coproduct of
representables is often too strong of a condition. Instead, we will only ask
that $F$ be a lax conical colimit of representables. This in turn allows for
the weaker notion of lax generic factorizations (and lax familial
representability) for pseudofunctors of bicategories
$T\colon\mathscr{A}\to\mathscr{B}$.
  We also compare our lax familial pseudofunctors to Weber's familial
2-functors, finding our description is more general (not requiring a terminal
object in $\mathscr{A}$), though essentially equivalent when a terminal object
does exist. Moreover, our description of lax generics allows for an equivalence
between lax generic factorizations and lax familial representability.
  Finally, we characterize our lax familial pseudofunctors as right lax
$\mathsf{F}$-adjoints followed by locally discrete fibrations of bicategories,
which in turn yields a simple definition of parametric right adjoint
pseudofunctors.

Zipf's law pattern also arises in the population sizes of cities, the sizes of
corporations, and other patterns of abundance. By contrast, for the abundances
of different biological species, the probability of a population of size $n$ is
typically proportional to $1/n$, declining exponentially for larger $n$, the
log series pattern. This article shows that the differing patterns of Zipf's
law and the log series arise as the opposing endpoints of a more general
theory. The general theory follows from the generic form of all probability
patterns as a consequence of conserved average values and the associated
invariances of scale. To understand the common patterns of abundance, the
generic form of probability distributions plus the conserved average abundance
is sufficient. The general theory includes cases that are between the Zipf and

non-degenerate system Hamiltonian is needed for implementing local gauge
symmetries via canonical transformations. This requires the Hamiltonian to be

quadratic in the partial derivatives (""velocities"") of the fields in the
equivalent Lagrangian. Only then, an invertible correlation of momenta and

standard free Dirac equation in Minkowski space. However, if the Dirac spinor
is minimally coupled to gauge fields or embedded in a curved space-time, then a
new length parameter $\ell$ emerges that becomes a physical coupling constant
yielding novel interactions. For the U($1$) symmetry, a Fermi coupling to the
gauge field results, thus modifying the fermion's magnetic moment. In analogy,
new anomalous couplings of gravity and matter emerge due to the system's
diffeomorphism invariance in a dynamical space-time. The fermions now acquire a
curvature-dependent mass correction term. In addition, an anomalous
spin-torsion coupling appears. We briefly discuss the impact of these findings
for the existence of non-zero rest masses of neutrinos. Their consequence for
the physics of ""Big Bang"", cosmology, black holes, and of neutron stars as well

robustly asymptotically stable moving-horizon estimators (MHE) for
discrete-time nonlinear systems, and a mechanism to incorporate differential
privacy in moving-horizon estimation. We begin with an investigation of the
classical notion of strong local observability of nonlinear systems and its
relationship to optimization-based state estimation. We then present a general
moving-horizon estimation framework for strongly locally observable systems, as
an iterative minimization scheme in the space of probability measures. This
framework allows for the minimization of the estimation cost with respect to
different metrics. In particular, we consider two variants, which we name
$W_2$-MHE and KL-MHE, where the minimization scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein
distance and the KL-divergence, respectively. The $W_2$-MHE yields a
gradient-based estimator whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle filter, for which
we investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties. Stability
results for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in the probabilistic
setting, against the backdrop of the classical notion of strong local
observability which, to the best of our knowledge, differentiates it from other
previous works. We then propose a mechanism to encode differential privacy of
the measurements used by the estimator via an entropy regularization of the MHE
objective functional. In particular, we find sufficient bounds on the
regularization parameter to achieve the desired level of differential privacy.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of these estimators.

here we explicitly compute the constraints on fractional D-brane charges at

equivariant K-theory to equivariant Cohomotopy theory, through Boardman's
comparison homomorphism. We check the relevant cases and find that this
condition singles out precisely those fractional D-brane charges which do not
take irrational values, in any twisted sector. Given that the possibility of
irrational D-brane charge has been perceived as a paradox in string theory, we
conclude that Hypothesis H serves to resolve this paradox.
  Concretely, we first explain that the Boardman homomorphism, in the present
case, is the map from the Burnside ring to the representation ring of the
singularity group given by forming virtual permutation representations. Then we
describe an explicit algorithm that computes the image of this comparison map
for any finite group. We run this algorithm for binary Platonic groups, hence
for finite subgroups of SU(2); and we find explicitly that for the three

subgroups the comparison morphism surjects precisely onto the sub-lattice of

for the development of novel electronic devices. Here a key challenge is to
implement and combine low power consumption, high operation speed, reliable
reversibility and compatibility with semiconductor technology. Hybrid
structures based on the assembly of ferromagnetic and semiconducting building
blocks are attractive candidates in that respect as such systems bring together
the properties of the isolated constituents: They are expected to show magnetic
order as a ferromagnet and to be electrically tunable as a semiconductor. Here
we demonstrate the electrical control of the exchange coupling in a hybrid
consisting of a ferromagnetic Co layer and a semiconductor CdTe quantum well,
separated by a thin non-magnetic (Cd,Mg)Te barrier. The effective magnetic
field of the exchange interaction reaches up to 2.5 Tesla and can be turned on
and off by application of 1 V bias across the heterostructure. The mechanism of
this electric field control is essentially different from the conventional
concept, in which wavefunctions are spatially redistributed to vary the
exchange interaction, requiring high field strengths. Here we address instead
control of the novel exchange mechanism that is mediated by elliptically
polarized phonons emitted from the ferromagnet, i.e. the phononic ac Stark
effect. An essential parameter of this coupling is the splitting between heavy
and light hole states in the quantum well which can be varied by the electric
field induced band bending. Thereby the splitting can be tuned with respect to
the magnon-phonon resonance energy in the ferromagnet, leading to maximum
coupling for flat band conditions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
electrically controlled exchange coupling in hybrid semiconductor
nanostructures at quite moderate electric field strengths.

cosine-envelope circularly-polarized laser fields are studied in detail. With
an introduction of the envelope modulation, the radiation spectra exhibit high
complexity attributed to the strong nonlinear interactions. On the other hand,
four fundamental laws related to the scale invariance of the radiation spectra
are analytically revealed and numerically validated. They are the laws for the
radiation energy as the $6$th power of the motion constant exactly, also as the
approximate negative $6$th power with respect to the initial axial momentum and
laser intensity in a certain of conditions, respectively, and finally an
important self-similar law, i.e., when the circular laser frequency, the
envelope modulation frequency, and the modified cyclotron frequency are
simultaneously increased by a factor, the radiation energy will be increased by
the second power of that factor without changing the shape of the spectrum.
With the application of these laws, especially the last one, a much higher
radiation energy can be obtained and the harmonic at which the maximum
radiation occurs can be precisely tuned without changing its amplitude. These
findings provide a possible way to advance radiation technology in many fields
such as medicine, communications, astrophysics, and security.

underlie protein function and emerge through a folding process from

yet be easily tracked for all proteins. To gain qualitative insights into the
fundamental mechanisms behind the folding dynamics and generic features of the
folded structure, we propose a simple model of structure formation that takes
into account only fundamental geometric constraints and otherwise assumes
randomly paired connections. We find that despite its simplicity, the model
results in a network ensemble consistent with key overall features of the
ensemble of Protein Residue Networks we obtained from more than 1000 biological
protein geometries as available through the Protein Data Base. Specifically,
the distribution of the number of interaction neighbors a unit (amino acid)
has, the scaling of the structure's spatial extent with chain length, the
eigenvalue spectrum and the scaling of the smallest relaxation time with chain

interest and are separately authenticated by the platform itself. There have
been repeated assertions by these platforms about verification not being
tantamount to endorsement. However, a significant body of prior work suggests
that possessing a verified status symbolizes enhanced credibility in the eyes
of the platform audience. As a result, such a status is highly coveted among
public figures and influencers. Hence, we attempt to characterize the network

verified users on Twitter (as of July 2018) and obtained 231,246 user profiles

In the near horizon (NH) region, these equations solved in terms of the Bessel

on the background geometry. For computing the BQNMs instead of the ordinary
quasinormal modes (QNMs), we first impose the purely ingoing wave condition at

the LMC, while the strongest episode of star formation in the SMC occurred a
few Gyr later. A peak in star formation around 0.7 Gyr ago in both Clouds is
likely linked to their recent interaction. The Andromeda satellite pair
NGC147/185 show different histories; the main epoch of star formation for NGC
185 occurred 8.3 Gyr ago, followed by a much lower, but relatively constant
star formation rate (SFR). In the case of NGC 147, the SFR peaked only 6.9 Gyr
ago, staying intense until ~ 3 Gyr ago. Star formation in the isolated gas-rich

data-intensive applications. A service differs from this kind of applications
in that it usually waits for requests from clients and replies with useful
information; moreover, a service is typically subjected to some predefined
constraints, called Service Level Agreement (SLA), including both temporal and
performance restrictions. In this paper we present the TAAROA middleware, a
software system that tries to extend the traditional target of the Grid
computing paradigm to include the service concept. It attempts to accomplish
its goal by using the virtualization technology. By abstracting the hardware
and software resources of a computer, virtualization brings to TAAROA two
important benefits: (1) the encapsulation of the service runtime environment,
and (2) the possibility, through the migration facility, to move a service from
the computer where it is running to another one that hopefully reduces the risk
of violating some of the SLA constraints. In the current version of TAAROA
middleware there is no explicit mechanism for achieving the level of a service
as defined by the related SLA; this means that actually TAAROA is only able to
provide a best-effort service.

central point in both compressed sensing (CS) and discrete tomography. In CS
the signal structure is described by means of a low complexity model e.g.
co-/sparsity. The CS theory shows that any signal/image can be undersampled at
a rate dependent on its intrinsic complexity. Moreover, in such undersampling
regimes, the signal can be recovered by sparsity promoting convex
regularization like $\ell_1$- or total variation (TV-) minimization. Precise
relations between many low complexity measures and the sufficient number of
random measurements are known for many sparsity promoting norms. However, a
precise estimate of the undersampling rate for the TV seminorm is still
lacking. We address this issue by: a) providing dual certificates testing
uniqueness of a given cosparse signal with bounded signal values, b)
approximating the undersampling rates via the statistical dimension of the TV
descent cone and c) showing empirically that the provided rates also hold for
tomographic measurements.

detecting potential regions where new changes may have occurred, and (2)
effectively reconstructing both the old and new structures by computing
regional weights that moderate the local influence of the priors. We have

improvement in data rate over the last three decades. The increased demand in
data traffic and the limited optoelectronic component bandwidths have led to
state-of-the-art systems employing hundreds of separate lasers in each
transmitter. Given the limited optical amplifier bandwidths, focus is now
shifting to maximize the spectral efficiency, SE. However, the frequency jitter
from neighbouring lasers results in uncertainties of the exact channel
wavelength, requiring large guardbands to avoid catastrophic channel overlap.
Optical frequency combs with optimal line spacings (typically around 10-50 GHz)
can overcome these limitations and maximize the SE. Recent developments in
microresonator-based soliton frequency combs (hereafter microcombs) promise a
compact, power efficient multi-wavelength and phase-locked light source for
optical communications. Here we demonstrate a microcomb-based communication
link achieving state-of-the-art spectral efficiency that has previously only
been possible with bulk-optics systems. Compared to previous microcomb works in
optical communications, our microcomb features a narrow line spacing of 22.1
GHz. In addition, it provides a four order-of-magnitude more stable line
spacing compared to free-running lasers. The optical signal-to-noise ratio
(OSNR) is sufficient for information encoding using state-of-the-art high-order
modulation formats. This enables us to demonstrate transmission of a 12 Tb/s
superchannel over distances ranging from a single 82 km span with an SE
exceeding 10 bits/s/Hz, to 2000 km with an SE higher than 6 bits/s/Hz. These

recent years due to their ability to produce dense depth from monocular images.
The main idea behind them is to optimize the photometric consistency over image
sequences by warping one view into another, similar to direct visual odometry
methods. One major drawback is that these methods infer depth from a single
view, which might not effectively capture the relation between pixels.
Moreover, simply minimizing the photometric loss does not ensure proper pixel
correspondences, which is a key factor for accurate depth and pose estimations.
  In contrast, we propose a 2-view depth network to infer the scene depth from
consecutive frames, thereby learning inter-pixel relationships. To ensure
better correspondences, thereby better geometric understanding, we propose
incorporating epipolar constraints to make the learning more geometrically
sound. We use the Essential matrix obtained using Nist'er's Five Point
Algorithm, to enforce meaningful geometric constraints, rather than using it as
training labels. This allows us to use lesser no. of trainable parameters
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method results in better
depth images and pose estimates, which capture the scene structure and motion
in a better way. Such a geometrically constrained learning performs
successfully even in cases where simply minimizing the photometric error would
fail.

nanophotonic structures, such as metasurfaces present a compelling alternative
to electronic implementations of convolutional neural networks. The lack of a
low-power optical nonlinearity, however, requires slow and energy-inefficient
conversions between the electronic and optical domains. Here, we design an
architecture which utilizes a single electrical to optical conversion by
designing a free-space optical frontend unit that implements the linear
operations of the first layer with the subsequent layers realized
electronically. Speed and power analysis of the architecture indicates that the
hybrid photonic-electronic architecture outperforms sole electronic
architecture for large image sizes and kernels. Benchmarking of the
photonic-electronic architecture on a modified version of AlexNet achieves a
classification accuracy of 87% on images from the Kaggle Cats and Dogs
challenge database.

  Machine Learning","IEEE Communications Magazine, 2019",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supporting ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) is a major
challenge of 5G wireless networks. Stringent delay and reliability requirements
need to be satisfied for both scheduled and non-scheduled URLLC traffic to
enable a diverse set of 5G applications. Although physical and media access
control layer solutions have been investigated to satisfy only scheduled URLLC
traffic, there is a lack of study on enabling transmission of non-scheduled
URLLC traffic, especially in coexistence with the scheduled URLLC traffic.
Machine learning (ML) is an important enabler for such a co-existence scenario
due to its ability to exploit spatial/temporal correlation in user behaviors
and use of radio resources. Hence, in this paper, we first study the
coexistence design challenges, especially the radio resource management (RRM)
problem and propose a distributed risk-aware ML solution for RRM. The proposed
solution benefits from hybrid orthogonal/non-orthogonal radio resource slicing,
and proactively regulates the spectrum needed for satisfying delay/reliability
requirement of each URLLC traffic type. A case study is introduced to
investigate the potential of the proposed RRM in serving coexisting URLLC
traffic types. The results further provide insights on the benefits of
leveraging intelligent RRM, e.g. a 75% increase in data rate with respect to
the conservative design approach for the scheduled traffic is achieved, while
the 99.99% reliability of both scheduled and nonscheduled traffic types is
satisfied.

predict material properties, however, computational complexity of these
calculations often imposes prohibitively high cost on the search for desired
material. This critical bottleneck is resolved by using deep machine learning
to emulate the quantum computations. However, the deep learning algorithms
require a large training dataset to ensure an acceptable generalization, which
is often unavailable a-priory. In this paper, we propose a deep Gaussian
process based approach to develop an emulator for quantum calculations. We
further propose a novel molecular descriptor that enables implementation of the

challenge to the photon-to-charge efficiency in the photocell. In this paper,
we investigate how to suppress radiative recombination rate (RRR) in a proposed
quantum photocell with three dipole-dipole coupled and uncoupled electron
donors. The results showed that the RRR could be suppressed in this photocell
with three uncoupled electron donors but be enhanced with three dipole-dipole
coupled electron donors by the ambient circumstance temperatures, and the
increasing energy gap in the donors, the decreasing gap between the donors and
acceptor inhabited the RRR with three dipole-dipole both coupled and uncoupled
electron donors. When the photocell was manipulated by the electrostatic
dipole-dipole coupling strength J at room temperature, the RRR was suppressed
to a smaller minimum by the gap between the donors and acceptor than those by
different gaps in the donors. These suppressed strategies for RRR point out
some significant ways to increase the photon-to-charge efficiency and deserve
the further experimental verification.
