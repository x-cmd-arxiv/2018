Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate the posterior distribution of the
parameters. Although there are several approaches available for model
selection, they are all based on the posterior samples produced via MCMC, which
means that the model selection inference inherits the properties of the MCMC
sampler. To improve on current approaches to LBA inference we propose two
methods that are based on recent advances in particle MCMC methodology; they
are qualitatively different from existing approaches as well as from each
other. The first approach is particle Metropolis-within-Gibbs; the second
approach is density tempered sequential Monte Carlo. Both new approaches
provide very efficient sampling and can be applied to estimate the marginal
likelihood, which provides Bayes factors for model selection. The first
approach is usually faster. The second approach provides a direct estimate of
the marginal likelihood, uses the first approach in its Markov move step and is
very efficient to parallelize on high performance computers. The new methods
are illustrated by applying them to simulated and real data, and through pseudo
code. The code implementing the methods is freely available.

spin-frequencies measured with GBM and 15-50 keV fluxes measured with the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope to model the system's intrinsic
spin-up. Power spectra measured with NICER show considerable evolution with
luminosity, including a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) near 50 mHz that is
omnipresent at low luminosity and has an evolving central frequency. Pulse
profiles measured over the combined 0.2-100 keV range show complex evolution
that is both luminosity and energy dependent. Near the critical luminosity of
L~1E+38 erg/s, the pulse profiles transition from single-peaked to double
peaked, the pulsed fraction reaches a minimum in all energy bands, and the
hardness ratios in both NICER and GBM show a turn-over to softening as the
intensity increases. This behavior repeats as the outburst rises and fades,
indicating two distinct accretion regimes. These two regimes are suggestive of
the accretion structure on the neutron star surface transitioning from a
Coulomb collisional stopping mechanism at lower luminosities to a
radiation-dominated stopping mechanism at higher luminosities. This is the
highest observed (to date) value of the critical luminosity, suggesting a
magnetic field of B ~1E+13 G.

important role in transition to turbulence. In plane Couette flow, steady
versions of these states are found on two intertwined solution branches
describing homoclinic snaking (Schneider $\textit{et al.}$ 2010a). These
branches can be used to generate a number of spatially localized initial
conditions whose transition can be investigated. From the low Reynolds numbers
where homoclinic snaking is first observed ($Re < 175$) to transitional ones
($Re \approx 325$), these spatially localized states traverse various regimes
where their relaminarisation time and dynamics are affected by the dynamical
structure of phase space. These regimes are reported and characterised in this
paper for a $4\pi$ periodic domain in the streamwise direction as a function of
the two remaining variables: the Reynolds number and the width of the localized
pattern. Close to the snaking, localized states are attracted by spatially
localized periodic orbits before relaminarising. At larger values of the
Reynolds number, the flow enters a chaotic transient of variable duration
before relaminarising. Very long chaotic transients ($t > 10^4$) can be
observed without difficulty for relatively low values of the Reynolds number
($Re \approx 250$).

to study the terahertz resonance characteristics of a metamaterial (MM)
comprising a spiral connected to a straight arm. The MM acts as a RLC circuit
whose resonance frequency can be precisely tuned by varying the characteristic
geometrical parameters of the spiral: inner and outer radius, width and number
of turns. We provide a simple analytical model that uses these geometrical
parameters as input to give accurate estimates of the resonance frequency.
Finite element simulations show that linearly polarized terahertz radiation
efficiently couples to the MM thanks to the straight arm, inducing a current in
the spiral, which in turn induces a resonant magnetic field enhancement at the
center of the spiral. We observe a large (approximately 20 times) and uniform
(over an area of $\sim 10~\mu m^{2}$) enhancement of the magnetic field for
narrowband terahertz radiation with frequency matching the resonance frequency
of the MM. When a broadband, single-cycle terahertz pulse propagates towards
the metamaterial, the peak magnetic field of the resulting band-passed waveform
still maintains a 6-fold enhancement compared to the peak impinging field.
Using existing laser-based terahertz sources, our metamaterial design allows to
generate magnetic fields of the order of 2 T over a time scale of several
picoseconds, enabling the investigation of non-linear ultrafast spin dynamics
in table-top experiments. Furthermore, our MM can be implemented to generate
intense near-field narrowband, multi-cycle electromagnetic fields to study

We investigate the motion of the small particles through the matrix of large
particles as well as the motion of the large particles. A particular focus is
on the coupling of the collective dynamics of the small and large particles and
on the different mechanisms leading to this coupling. For large size ratios,
about 1:5, and an increasing fraction of small particles, the dynamics of the
two species become increasingly coupled and reflect the structure of the large
particles. This is attributed to the dominant effect of the large particles on
the motion of the small particles which is mediated by the increasing crowding
of the small particles. Furthermore, for moderate size ratios, about 1:3, and
sufficiently high fractions of small particles, mixed cages are formed and
hence the dynamics are also strongly coupled. Again, the coupling becomes
weaker as the fraction of small particles is decreased. In this case, however,
the collective intermediate scattering function of the small particles shows a
logarithmic decay corresponding to a broad range of relaxation times.

assume the existence of the dark matter channel n -> chi + \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_e,
where \nu_e \bar{\nu}_e is the electron neutrino-antineutrino pair. This allows
to describe the discrepancy between the measurements of the neutron lifetime
even in case of an unobservability of the dark matter decay channel n -> \chi +
e^- + e^+, which may be below the reaction threshold. The existence of the

electron-neutron scattering e^- + n -> \chi + e^- at very low electron
energies, induced with the strength as of the decay n -> \chi + \nu_e +

SU_L(2)\times U_R(1) \times U_R'(1)\times U''_L(1) symmetry for the UV
completion of the effective (n\chi \ell \bar{\ell}) interaction, where

be frequently encountered in nature. However, few studies have quantitatively
investigated the evolution process of lock-exchange gravity currents in such
environments. A new set of analytical formulae is proposed by integrating both
mass conservation and linear momentum equations to determine the front velocity
and the front location of a downslope current. Based on the thermal theory, the
formula considers the influence of ambient stratification by introducing a
newly defined stratification coefficient in the acceleration stage. As for the
deceleration stage, the formula is derived by adding a parameter that takes
into account the density distribution of the ambient water. The transition
point between the acceleration and deceleration stages and the maximum front
velocity are also determined by the proposed formulae. Lock-exchange gravity
current experiments are conducted in the flume with linear stratifications to
provide data for the validation of the formulae. The comparisons between the
calculated and measured data in terms of front location and front velocity show
satisfactory agreements, which reveal that front velocity presents a rapid
acceleration stage and then a deceleration stage in a linearly stratified
ambient.

being the It\^o and Stratonovich prescriptions. Here we show that the
requirement of general covariance under field redefinitions is verified only in
the latter case, however at the expense of introducing spurious `frame'
dependences. This stochastic anomaly disappears when there is only one source
of stochasticity, like in slow-roll single-field inflation, but manifests
itself when taking into account the full phase space, or in the presence of
multiple fields. Despite these difficulties, we use physical arguments to write
down a covariant Fokker-Planck equation that describes the diffusion of light
scalar fields in non-linear sigma models in the overdamped limit. We apply it
to test scalar fields in de Sitter space and show that some statistical
properties of a class of two-field models with derivative interactions can be
reproduced by using a correspondence with a single-field model endowed with an
effective potential. We also present explicit results in a simple extension of
the single-field $\lambda \phi^4$ theory to a hyperbolic field space geometry.
The difficulties we describe seem to be the stochastic counterparts of the
notoriously difficult problem of maintaining general covariance in quantum
theories, and the related choices of operator ordering and path-integral
constructions. Our work thus opens new avenues of research at the crossroad
between cosmology, statistical physics, and quantum field theory.

are on the order of 0.1-1 {\mu}m in size. On the other hand, the loop WFM
domains are ~100 {\mu}m in size, and there exists no interlocking of FE and WFM
domain walls. These strongly manifest the decoupling between FE and WFM in
h-LSFO. The domain decoupling can be explained as the consequence of the
structure-mediated coupling between polarization and dominant in-plane
antiferromagnetic spins according to the theoretical prediction, which reveals
intriguing interplays between FE, WFM, and antiferromagnetic orders in h-LSFO.
Our results also indicate that the magnetic topological charge tends to be

popularity recently. In a match of such games, players compete in two teams of
five, each controlling an in-game avatars, known as heroes, selected from a
roster of more than 100. The selection of heroes, also known as pick or draft,
takes place before the match starts and alternates between the two teams until
each player has selected one hero. Heroes are designed with different strengths
and weaknesses to promote team cooperation in a game. Intuitively, heroes in a
strong team should complement each other's strengths and suppressing those of
opponents. Hero drafting is therefore a challenging problem due to the complex
hero-to-hero relationships to consider. In this paper, we propose a novel hero
recommendation system that suggests heroes to add to an existing team while
maximizing the team's prospect for victory. To that end, we model the drafting
between two teams as a combinatorial game and use Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) for estimating the values of hero combinations. Our empirical evaluation
shows that hero teams drafted by our recommendation algorithm have
significantly higher win rate against teams constructed by other baseline and

stellar models to the observed mode frequencies of the 67 stars, including the
Sun, in the $Kepler$ LEGACY sample, using three different empirical surface
corrections. The three surface corrections we analyse are a frequency
power-law, a cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia, and a linear
combination of an inverse and cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia.
We construct a grid of stellar evolution models using the stellar evolution
code MESA and calculate mode frequencies using GYRE. We scale the frequencies
of each stellar model by an empirical calculated homology coefficient, which
greatly improves the robustness of our grid. We calculate stellar parameters
and surface corrections for each star using the average of the best-fitting
models from each evolutionary track, weighted by the likelihood of each model.
The resulting model stellar parameters agree well with an independent
reference, the $\texttt{BASTA}$ pipeline. However, we find that the adopted
physics of the stellar models has a greater impact on the fitted stellar
parameters than the choice of correction method. We find that scaling the
frequencies by the mode inertia improves the fit between the models and
observations. The inclusion of the inverse frequency term produces
substantially better model fits to lower surface gravity stars.

objects reach polarization fractions of >10% in the continuum. We propose a
model in which dust scattering is the dominant scattering and polarization
mechanism in our targets, though electron scattering cannot be completely
excluded. Emission lines are polarized at a lower level than is the continuum.
This suggests that the emission-line region exists on similar spatial scales as
the scattering region. In three objects we detect an intriguing 90 degree swing
in the polarization position angle as a function of line-of-sight velocity in
the emission lines of Ly-alpha, CIV and NV. We interpret this phenomenon in the
framework of a geometric model with an equatorial dusty scattering region in
which the material is outflowing at several thousand km/sec. Emission lines may
also be scattered by dust or resonantly. This model explains several salient
features of observations by scattering on scales of a few tens of pc. Our
observations provide a tantalizing view of the inner region geometry and

normal distance-independent properties (e.g. colour, velocity dispersion of its

those of other similar galaxies, namely the luminosity function and sizes of
its globular clusters, mass-to-light ratio and dark matter content. Here we

extent. The resulting dust and gas dynamics can give rise to observable
structures, such as gas and dust cavities. Our results show that the dust
back-reaction can play a major role in both the dynamics and observational
appearance of protoplanetary discs, and cannot be ignored in models of
protoplanetary disc evolution.

recently been found by Yang et al. (2017). Yet we still do not know their
detailed properties, such as morphologies, AGN occupations, massive star

blueberries, we investigate the spectroscopic and photometric properties of two
blueberry candidates, RGG B and RGG 5, for which Hubble Space Telescope
high-resolution images are available. We find that RGG B and RGG 5 perhaps are
likely to be two merging dwarf galaxy systems. RGG B may have a close merging
companion; yet the current evidence still cannot exclude the possibility that
RGG B is just disturbed by in-situ star formation through, e.g., outflows,
rather than undergoing a merger. RGG 5 presents stellar shells in the outskirt
which can be the powerful evidence of galaxy merging. We also find that, all of
the blueberries, including RGG B and RGG 5, are located close to the
theoretical maximum-starburst-line in the BPT diagram, have very high
ionization parameters, and relatively low hardness ionizing radiation fields,
exhibit nitrogen overabundances, and show extremely red mid-IR colors, and
reside in the so-called ""ULIRGs/LINERs/Obscured AGN"" region. The blueberry
galaxies may not harbor AGN.

consequence of the current Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological paradigm. In
this context, we discuss here the properties of MCG+11-11-032, a local
(z=0.0362) Seyfert 2 galaxy. This source was proposed as a dual AGN candidate
on the basis of the presence of double-peaked [OIII] emission lines in its
optical spectrum. MCG+11-11-032 is also an X-ray variable source and was
observed several times by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) on time scales from
days to years. In this work, we analyze the SDSS-DR13 spectrum and find
evidence for double-peaked profiles in all the strongest narrow emission lines.
We also study the XRT light curve and unveil the presence of an alternating
behavior of the intrinsic 0.3-10 keV flux, while the 123-month Swift BAT light
curve supports the presence of almost regular peaks and dips almost every 25
months. In addition, the XRT spectrum suggests for the presence of two narrow
emission lines with rest-frame energies of E~6.16 keV and E~6.56 keV. Although
by considering only the optical emission lines, different physical mechanisms
may be invoked to explain the kinematical properties, the X-ray results are
most naturally explained by the presence of a binary SMBH in the center of this
source. In particular, we evidence a remarkable agreement between the putative
SMBH pair orbital velocity derived from the BAT light curve and the velocity
offset derived by the rest-frame Delta_E between the two X-ray line peaks in
the XRT spectrum (i.e. Delta_v~0.06c).

new two features that hold in all the oscillation channels are uncovered in the

particular combination with the $\nu$SM CP phase $\delta$ in the form $[e^{- i

the irreducible susceptibility result in a non-zero spectral weight of the
corresponding fluctuations above the particle-hole continuum boundary. It is
shown that the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility,
$\text{Im}\chi_{s}(\bf{q},\omega)$, falls off as $q^2/\omega$ for frequencies
above the continuum boundary ($\omega\gg v_{F} q$) and below the
model-dependent cutoff frequency, whereas the imaginary part of the charge
susceptibility, $\text{Im}\chi_c(\bf{q},\omega)$, falls off as $(q/k_F)^2

$(q/k_F)^2$ in $\text{Im}\chi_c(\bf{q},\omega)$ as compared to
$\text{Im}\chi_{s}(\bf{q},\omega)$ is a direct consequence of Galilean
invariance. The imaginary part of the nematic susceptibility increases linearly
with $\omega$ up to a peak at the ultraviolet energy scale-- the plasma
frequency and/or Fermi energy--and then decreases with $\omega$. We also obtain

Cloud (LMC) modifies the radial motions of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected
from the Galactic Center. For typical HVSs ejected towards low (high) Galactic
latitudes, the disk bends trajectories by up to 30 degrees (3-10 deg). For many
lines-of-sight through the Galaxy, the LMC produces similar and sometimes
larger deflections. Bound HVSs suffer larger deflections than unbound HVSs.
Gravitational focusing by the LMC also generates a factor of two overdensity
along the line-of-sight towards the LMC. With large enough samples,
observations can detect the non-radial orbits and the overdensity of HVSs
towards the LMC. For any Galactic potential model, the Galactic rest-frame
tangential velocity provides an excellent way to detect unbound and nearly
bound HVSs within 10 kpc of the Sun. Similarly, the rest-frame radial velocity
isolates unbound HVSs beyond 10-15 kpc from the Sun. Among samples of unbound

coupled large scale superfluid components in the neutron star interior. This
process leads to rapid exchange of angular momentum and an increase in spin
frequency. The transfer of angular momentum is regulated by a dissipative
mutual friction, whose strength defines the spin-up timescale of a glitch.
Hence, observations of glitch rises can be used to shed light on the dominant
microphysical interactions at work in the high density interior of the star. We
present a simple analytical model, complemented with more detailed numerical
simulations, which produces a fast spin-up followed by a more gradual rise.
Such features are observed in some large glitches of the Crab pulsar, including
the largest recent glitch of 2017. We also use observations to constrain the
mutual friction coefficient of the glitch-driving region for two possible
locations: the inner crust and outer core of the star. We find that the
features of Crab glitches require smaller values of the mutual friction
coefficient than those needed to explain the much faster Vela spin-ups. This
suggests a crustal origin for the former but an outer core contribution for the
latter.

well described by an effective Hamiltonian which sensitively depends on

signal in a typically overcomplete dictionary. From a Bayesian perspective,
sparse coding provides a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the unknown
vector under a sparse prior. In this work, we suggest enhancing the performance
of sparse coding algorithms by a deliberate and controlled contamination of the
input with random noise, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. The
proposed method adds controlled noise to the input and estimates a sparse
representation from the perturbed signal. A set of such solutions is then
obtained by projecting the original input signal onto the recovered set of
supports. We present two variants of the described method, which differ in
their final step. The first is a provably convergent approximation to the
Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, relying on the generative model and
applying a weighted average over the recovered solutions. The second is a
relaxed variant of the former that simply applies an empirical mean. We show
that both methods provide a computationally efficient approximation to the MMSE
estimator, which is typically intractable to compute. We demonstrate our
findings empirically and provide a theoretical analysis of our method under

breakthroughs within the last decades, but the practicability of these methods

programming on tree decompositions. Indisputably, this is a key technique in
parameterized algorithms and modern algorithm design. Despite the enormous
impact of this approach in theory, it still has very little influence on
practical implementations. The reasons for this phenomenon are manifold. One of
them is the simple fact that such an implementation requires a long chain of
non-trivial tasks (as computing the decomposition, preparing it,...). We
provide an easy way to implement such dynamic programs that only requires the
definition of the update rules. With this interface, dynamic programs for
various problems, such as 3-coloring, can be implemented easily in about 100
lines of structured Java code.
  The theoretical foundation of the success of dynamic programming on tree
decompositions is well understood due to Courcelle's celebrated theorem, which
states that every MSO-definable problem can be efficiently solved if a tree
decomposition of small width is given. We seek to provide practical access to
this theorem as well, by presenting a lightweight model-checker for a small
fragment of MSO. This fragment is powerful enough to describe many natural
problems, and our model-checker turns out to be very competitive against

increase can be rigorously proved from mathematical physics. However, carefully
examining its detailed formulation reveals that the traditional identification
of logically reversible computational operations with bijective transformations
of the full digital state space is actually not the correct logical-level
characterization of the full set of classical computational operations that can
be carried out physically with asymptotically zero energy dissipation. To find
the correct logical conditions for physical reversibility, we must account for
initial-state probabilities when applying the Principle. The minimal
logical-level requirement for the physical reversibility of deterministic
computational operations is that the subset of initial states that exhibit
nonzero probability in a given statistical operating context must be
transformed one-to-one into final states. Thus, any computational operation is
conditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive precondition
on its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any
deterministic operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0
when the probability of meeting any preselected one of its suitable
preconditions approaches 1. This realization facilitates simpler designs for
asymptotically thermodynamically reversible computational hardware, compared to
designs that are restricted to using only fully-bijective operations such as
Toffoli type operations. Thus, this more general framework for reversible
computing provides a more effective theoretical foundation to use for the
design of practical reversible computers than does the more restrictive
traditional model of reversible logic. In this paper, we formally develop the
theoretical foundations of the generalized model, and briefly survey some of
its applications.

efforts have been made to secure them. This serves as our main motivation for
constructing a means for password harvesting from keyboard thermal emanations.
Specifically, we introduce Thermanator, a new post factum insider attack based

post factum (planned or impromptu) thermal imaging attacks are realistic, and
finally (3) perhaps it is time to either stop using keyboards for password

of emergent gravity in de Sitter space and the earlier work that described
emergent gravity using holographic screens. A modified (non)holographic screen
scenario is presented, wherein the screen fails to encode an emergent mass in
the bulk ""unemerged"" part of space for sufficiently large length-scales, where
the volume-law of the non-holographic bulk degrees of freedom overtakes the
area-law scaling of the entropy of the screen. Within this framework, we can
describe both an emergent dark gravitational force, which scales like
$\frac{1}{r}$, and also a version of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. We
therefore recast these results within an emergent gravity framework in which
there is an explicit violation of holography for sufficiently large
length-scales.

Helioseismic and Magnetic Images exhibit magnetic flux cancellation
simultaneously, supporting that the IRIS jets are driven by magnetic
reconnection. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly images also show an extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) brightening which is shortly after the underlying IRIS jets,
i.e., in the 131 A, 171 A, 193 A, 211 A, and 94 A channels, implying that the

old contacts may disappear. They can be modeled as temporal graphs where
interactions between vertices (which represent people in the case of social
networks) are represented by time-stamped edges. One of the most fundamental
problems in (social) network analysis is community detection, and one of the
most basic primitives to model a community is a clique. Addressing the problem
of finding communities in temporal networks, Viard et al. [TCS 2016] introduced
$\Delta$-cliques as a natural temporal version of cliques. Himmel et al. [SNAM
2017] showed how to adapt the well-known Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate
$\Delta$-cliques. We continue this work and improve and extend the algorithm of
Himmel et al. to enumerate temporal $k$-plexes (notably, cliques are the
special case $k=1$).
  We define a $\Delta$-$k$-plex as a set of vertices and a time interval, where
during this time interval each vertex has in each consecutive $\Delta + 1$ time
steps at least one edge to all but at most $k-1$ vertices in the chosen set of
vertices. We develop a recursive algorithm for enumerating all maximal
$\Delta$-$k$-plexs and perform experiments on real-world social networks that
demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach. In particular, for the
special case of $\Delta$-1-plexes (that is, $\Delta$-cliques), we observe that
our algorithm is on average significantly faster than the previous algorithms
by Himmel et al. [SNAM 2017] and Viard et al. [IPL 2018] for enumerating
$\Delta$-cliques.

distinguish between merging and rotationally supported systems, and reveal the
possible presence of ejected gas. For galaxies that have evidence for outflows,
we derive outflow energetics and mass-loading factors compatible with those
observed for stellar winds in local and high-z galaxies. We also use flux ratio
diagnostics to derive gas-phase metallicities. The low signal-to-noise ratio in
the faint H$\beta$ and nitrogen lines allows us to derive an upper limit of ~
0.15 dex for the spatial variations in metallicity along the slit for the
lensed galaxy J1038. Analysed near-infrared spectra presented here represent
the first scientific demonstration of performing AO-assisted multi-object

theoretically and confirmed experimentally. Here, we predict the emergence of
two-dimensional type-II Dirac fermions in LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum-well
structures. Using first-principles calculations and model analysis, we show
that the Dirac points are formed at the crossing between the dx2-y2 and dz2
bands protected by the mirror symmetry. The energy position of the Dirac points
can be tuned to appear at the Fermi energy by changing the quantum-well width.
For the quantum-well structure with a two-unit cell thick LaNiO3 layer, we
predict the coexistence of the type-II Dirac points and the Dirac nodal line.
The results are analyzed and interpreted using a tight-binding model and
symmetry arguments. Our findings offer a practical way to realize the 2D
type-II Dirac fermions in oxide heterostructures.

$A(e,e'p)$ and $A(e,e'pN)$, in kinematics sensitive to nuclear short-range
correlations, are studied using the nuclear contact formalism. A relation
between the spectral function and the nuclear contacts is derived and used to
analyze the dependence of the data on the initial energy and momentum of the
knocked-out proton. The ratio between the number of emitted proton-proton pairs
and proton-neutron pairs is shown to depend predominantly on a single ratio of
contacts. This ratio is expected to present a deep minima in the initial energy
and momentum plane, associated with the node in the proton-proton wave
function. The formalism is applied to analyze data from recent $^4$He and
$^{12}$C electron-scattering experiments performed at Jefferson laboratory.
Different nucleon-nucleon potentials were used to asses the model-dependence of
the results. For the ratio of proton-proton to proton-neutron pairs in $^4$He,
a fair agreement with the experimental data is obtained using the two
potentials, whereas for the ratio of proton-proton pairs to the total
knocked-out protons in $^{12}$C, some of the features of the theory are not
seen in the experimental data. Several possible explanations for this
disagreement are discussed. It is also observed that the spectral function at
specific domains of the momentum-energy plane is sensitive to the
nucleon-nucleon interaction. Based on this sensitivity, it might be possible to
constrain the short range part of the nuclear potential using such experimental
data.

compute the function $P(N,k,l,s)$ of Barnes and Savage. We further show that
the algorithm can be easily adapted to compute the $D(i)$ values for all $i\le
n$ in a single run. Theoretical analysis shows that the new algorithm to

previous algorithm to compute a single $D(n)$. Experimental evaluations show
that the constant of improvement is about 10. We also perform simulations to
estimate the asymptotic order of $D(n)$ by generating uniform random samples
from the set of $E(n)$ integer partitions of fixed length $n$ with even sum and
largest part less than $n$ and computing the proportion of them that are
graphical degree sequences. The known numerical results of $D(n)$ for $n\le

to make an informed guess about its unknown asymptotic order. The techniques
for the improved algorithm can be applied to compute other similar functions

which is affected by attentional and cognitive conditions, age, psychiatric
disorders and so forth. However, it remains unclear how the clustering
coefficient should be measured in a correlation-based network, which is among
major representations of brain networks. In the present article, we propose
clustering coefficients tailored to correlation matrices. The key idea is to
use three-way partial correlation or partial mutual information to measure the
strength of the association between the two neighbouring nodes of a focal node
relative to the amount of pseudo-correlation expected from indirect paths
between the nodes. Our method avoids the difficulties of previous applications
of clustering coefficient (and other) measures in defining correlational
networks, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value, discarding of negative
correlation values, the pseudo-correlation problem and full partial correlation
matrices whose estimation is computationally difficult. For proof of concept,
we apply the proposed clustering coefficient measures to functional magnetic
resonance imaging data obtained from healthy participants of various ages and
compare them with conventional clustering coefficients. We show that the
clustering coefficients decline with the age. The proposed clustering
coefficients are more strongly correlated with age than the conventional ones
are. We also show that the local variants of the proposed clustering
coefficients are useful in characterising individual nodes. In contrast, the
conventional local clustering coefficients were strongly correlated with and
therefore may be confounded by the node's connectivity.

Bayesian regression, but popular GP posterior inference methods are typically
prohibitively slow or lack desirable finite-data guarantees on quality. We
develop an approach to scalable approximate GP regression with finite-data
guarantees on the accuracy of pointwise posterior mean and variance estimates.
Our main contribution is a novel objective for approximate inference in the
nonparametric setting: the preconditioned Fisher (pF) divergence. We show that
unlike the Kullback--Leibler divergence (used in variational inference), the pF
divergence bounds the 2-Wasserstein distance, which in turn provides tight
bounds the pointwise difference of the mean and variance functions. We
demonstrate that, for sparse GP likelihood approximations, we can minimize the
pF divergence efficiently. Our experiments show that optimizing the pF
divergence has the same computational requirements as variational sparse GPs
while providing comparable empirical performance--in addition to our novel
finite-data quality guarantees.

programs that can be written in the language. There is a difference, however,
between all possible programs that can be written and the corpus of actual
programs written in a language. We seek to exploit this difference: for a given
program, we apply a bespoke program transformation Indexify to convert
expressions that current SMT solvers do not, in general, handle, such as
constraints on strings, into equisatisfiable expressions that they do handle.
To this end, Indexify replaces operators in hard-to-handle expressions with
homomorphic versions that behave the same on a finite subset of the domain of
the original operator, and return bottom denoting unknown outside of that
subset. By focusing on what literals and expressions are most useful for
analysing a given program, Indexify constructs a small, finite theory that
extends the power of a solver on the expressions a target program builds.
  Indexify's bespoke nature necessarily means that its evaluation must be
experimental, resting on a demonstration of its effectiveness in practice. We
have developed Indexif}, a tool for Indexify. We demonstrate its utility and
effectiveness by applying it to two real world benchmarks --- string
expressions in coreutils and floats in fdlibm53. Indexify reduces
time-to-completion on coreutils from Klee's 49.5m on average to 6.0m. It
increases branch coverage on coreutils from 30.10% for Klee and 14.79% for
Zesti to 66.83%. When indexifying floats in fdlibm53, Indexifyl increases
branch coverage from 34.45% to 71.56% over Klee. For a restricted class of
inputs, Indexify permits the symbolic execution of program paths unreachable
with previous techniques: it covers more than twice as many branches in
coreutils as Klee.

narrow-band and broadband, are based on orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM). This multiplexing scheme however suffers from the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which can considerably impact the energy
efficiency, size and cost of PLC modems as well as cause electromagnetic
compatibility (EMC) issues. This paper investigates the performance of vector
OFDM (VOFDM), which has inherently better PAPR properties, over non-Gaussian
broadband PLC channels equipped with two nonlinear preprocessors at the
receiver. In addition, the low PAPR property of the VOFDM system is exploited
to further enhance the efficiency of the nonlinear preprocessors. The
achievable gains are studied in terms of the complementary cumulative
distribution function of the PAPR, probability of noise detection error and the
signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the nonlinear preprocessors. For
comparison's sake, the performance of conventional OFDM systems is also
presented throughout the paper. Results reveal that the proposed system is able
to provide up to 2 dB saving in the transmit power relative to the conventional
OFDM under same system conditions, which eventually also translates into a
system that is more resilient to EMC limits, reduced cost and size of PLC
modems. It is also shown that the achievable gains become more significant as
the vector block (VB) size of the VOFDM system is increased.

multiple relaxation times to simulate thermal convective flows, which are

dynamics of the axial and radial momentum components along with the pressure
are represented by means of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with geometric mass
and momentum source terms in the pseudo Cartesian form, while the evolutions of
the azimuthal momentum and the temperature field are each modeled by an
advection-diffusion type equation with appropriate local source terms. Based on
these, cascaded LB schemes involving three distribution functions are
formulated to solve for the fluid motion in the meridian plane using a D2Q9
lattice, and to solve for the azimuthal momentum and the temperature field each
using a D2Q5 lattice. The geometric mass and momentum source terms for the flow
fields and the energy source term for the temperature field are included using
a new symmetric operator splitting technique, via pre-collision and
post-collision source steps around the cascaded collision step for each
distribution function. These result in a particularly simple and compact
formulation to directly represent the effect of various geometric source terms
consistently in terms of changes in the appropriate zeroth and first order
moments. Simulations of several complex buoyancy-driven thermal flows and
including rotational effects in cylindrical geometries using the new

Analogous scheme for the passive scalar transport represented by a
convection-diffusion equation with a source term in a novel cascaded LB
formulation is also derived. They are based on symmetric applications of the
split solutions of the changes on the scalar field/fluid momentum due to the
sources/forces over half time steps before and after the collision step. The
latter step is effectively represented in terms of the post-collision change of
moments at zeroth and first orders, respectively, to represent the effect of
the sources on the scalar transport and forces on the fluid flow. Such
symmetrized operator split cascaded LB schemes are consistent with the
second-order Strang splitting and naturally avoid any discrete effects due to
forces/sources by appropriately projecting their effects for higher order
moments. All the force/source implementation steps are performed only in the
moment space and they do not require formulations as extra terms and their
additional transformations to the velocity space. These result in particularly
simpler and efficient schemes to incorporate forces/sources in the cascaded LB
methods unlike those considered previously. Numerical study for various
benchmark problems in 2D and 3D for fluid flow problems with body forces and
scalar transport with sources demonstrate the validity and accuracy, as well as
the second-order convergence rate of the symmetrized operator split

represented by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations on standard lattices can lead
to non-Galilean invariant (GI) viscous stress involving cubic velocity errors.
This arises from the dependence of their third order diagonal moments on the
first order moments for standard lattices, and strategies have recently been
introduced to restore GI without such errors using a modified collision
operator involving either corrections to the relaxation times or to the moment
equilibria. Convergence acceleration in the simulation of steady flows can be
achieved by solving the preconditioned NS equations, which contain a
preconditioning parameter that alleviates the numerical stiffness. In the
present study, we present a GI formulation of the preconditioned cascaded
central moment LB method used to solve the preconditioned NS equations, which
is free of cubic velocity errors on a standard lattice. A Chapman-Enskog
analysis reveals the structure of the spurious non-GI defect terms and it is
demonstrated that the anisotropy of the resulting viscous stress is dependent
on the preconditioning parameter, in addition to the fluid velocity. It is
shown that partial correction to eliminate the cubic velocity defects is
achieved by scaling the cubic velocity terms in the off-diagonal third-order
moment equilibria with the square of the preconditioning parameter.
Furthermore, we develop additional corrections based on the extended moment
equilibria involving gradient terms with coefficients dependent locally on the
fluid velocity and the preconditioning parameter. Several conclusions are drawn
from the analysis of the structure of the non-GI errors and the associated
corrections, with particular emphasis on their dependence on the
preconditioning parameter. Improvements in accuracy and convergence
acceleration are demonstrated.

""stragglers"", can significantly extend the computation time. Recent results
have shown that error correction coding can be used to reduce the effect of
stragglers. In this work we introduce a scheme that, in addition to using error
correction to distribute mixed jobs across nodes, is also able to exploit the
work completed by all nodes, including stragglers. We first consider
vector-matrix multiplication and apply maximum distance separable (MDS) codes
to small blocks of sub-matrices. The worker nodes process blocks sequentially,
working block-by-block, transmitting partial per-block results to the master as
they are completed. Sub-blocking allows a more continuous completion process,
which thereby allows us to exploit the work of a much broader spectrum of
processors and reduces computation time. We then apply this technique to
matrix-matrix multiplication using product code. In this case, we show that the
order of computing sub-tasks is a new degree of design freedom that can be
exploited to reduce computation time further. We propose a novel approach to
analyze the finishing time, which is different from typical order statistics.
Simulation results show that the expected computation time decreases by a
factor of at least two in compared to previous methods.

  Judgments",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the area of human fixation prediction, dozens of computational saliency
models are proposed to reveal certain saliency characteristics under different
assumptions and definitions. As a result, saliency model benchmarking often
requires several evaluation metrics to simultaneously assess saliency models
from multiple perspectives. However, most computational metrics are not
designed to directly measure the perceptual similarity of saliency maps so that
the evaluation results may be sometimes inconsistent with the subjective
impression. To address this problem, this paper first conducts extensive
subjective tests to find out how the visual similarities between saliency maps
are perceived by humans. Based on the crowdsourced data collected in these
tests, we conclude several key factors in assessing saliency maps and quantize
the performance of existing metrics. Inspired by these factors, we propose to
learn a saliency evaluation metric based on a two-stream convolutional neural
network using crowdsourced perceptual judgements. Specifically, the relative
saliency score of each pair from the crowdsourced data is utilized to
regularize the network during the training process. By capturing the key
factors shared by various subjects in comparing saliency maps, the learned
metric better aligns with human perception of saliency maps, making it a good
complement to the existing metrics. Experimental results validate that the
learned metric can be generalized to the comparisons of saliency maps from new
images, new datasets, new models and synthetic data. Due to the effectiveness
of the learned metric, it also can be used to facilitate the development of new
models for fixation prediction.

horizontally guided by the wave it produces on impacting the bath. The wave
itself is modified by the environment, and thus the interactions of the moving

example of a pilot-wave system. Taking the Oza Rosales Bush description for
walking droplets as a theoretical pilot-wave model, we investigate the dynamics
of two interacting identical, in-phase bouncing droplets theoretically and
numerically. A remarkably rich range of behaviors is encountered as a function
of the two system parameters, the ratio of inertia to drag, \k{appa}, and the
ratio of wave forcing to drag, \b{eta}. The droplets typically travel together
in a tightly bound pair, although they unbind when the wave forcing is large
and inertia is small or inertia is moderately large and wave forcing is
moderately small. Bound pairs can exhibit a range of trajectories depending on
parameter values, including straight lines, sub-diffusive random walks, and
closed loops. The droplets themselves may maintain their relative positions,
oscillate towards and away from one another, or interchange positions regularly
or chaotically as they travel. We explore these regimes and others and the
bifurcations between them through analytic and numerical linear stability

masks. By representing such supervisions by over-complete dictionaries, the
tag-related object proposals can pop-out according to their sparse coding
length, which are then converted to superpixels with binary labels. After that,

dividing superpixels with mouse clicks, which are used as click supervisions

segmentation in aerial videos. From this dataset, we find most aerial videos
contain large-scale scenes, small primary objects as well as consistently
varying scales and viewpoints. Inspired by that, we propose a hierarchical deep
co-segmentation approach that repeatedly divides a video into two sub-videos
formed by the odd and even frames, respectively. In this manner, the primary
objects shared by sub-videos can be co-segmented by training two-stream CNNs
and finally refined within the neighborhood reversible flows. Experimental

the power spectrum. These statistics capture the full information encoded in
the Fourier amplitudes of the galaxy density field but do not describe the
Fourier phases of the field. Here, we quantify the information contained in the
line correlation function (LCF), a three-point Fourier phase correlation
function. Using cosmological simulations, we estimate the Fisher information
(at redshift $z=0$) of the 2PCF, LCF and their combination, regarding the
cosmological parameters of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as a Warm
Dark Matter (WDM) model and the $f(R)$ and Symmetron modified gravity models.
The galaxy bias is accounted for at the level of a linear bias. The relative
information of the 2PCF and the LCF depends on the survey volume, sampling
density (shot noise) and the bias uncertainty. For a volume of $1h^{-3}\rm
Gpc^3$, sampled with points of mean density $\bar{n} = 2\times10^{-3} h^{3}\
\rm Mpc^{-3}$ and a bias uncertainty of 13\%, the LCF improves the parameter
constraints by about 20\% in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and potentially even
more in alternative models. Finally, since a linear bias only affects the
Fourier amplitudes (2PCF), but not the phases (LCF), the combination of the
2PCF and the LCF can be used to break the degeneracy between the linear bias
and $\sigma_8$, present in 2-point statistics.

more rapid, objective assessments of the abnormalities. In this work, we
explore the usefulness of various objective measures of spatial
heterogeneity---fractal dimension, Moran's I, and Geary's C ---for
distinguishing between abnormal sarcoidosis and normal lung parenchyma.
  CT data for N=58 sarcoidosis subjects enrolled at National Jewish Health were
obtained from the GRADS study. CT data for N=101 control patients were obtained
from the COPDGene study. Radiomic measures were computed for each
two-dimensional slice of a given scan, in the axial, coronal, and sagittal
planes. Functional regression was applied to identify lung regions where CT
nodules tend to proliferate.
  Moran's I, Geary's C and fractal dimension significantly differentiate
between subjects with and without sarcoidosis throughout the majority of the
lung, with disease abnormalities most apparent in the top axial, middle
coronal, and outer sagittal regions. A trend appeared across Scadding stages,
with CT scans from patients with Scadding stages I and III appearing the
healthiest, and Scadding stage IV appearing the least healthy.
  The radiomic measures and techniques presented herein successfully
characterize CT images in sarcoidosis by objectively and efficiently
approximating what we know about the pathology of sarcoidosis.

mathematical approximations for determining the emergent dynamics often rely on
self-consistency arguments or limits as the aspect ratio of the `large' and

dynamics a new approach [IMA J. Appl. Maths, DOI: 10.1093/imamat/hxx021] which
analyses the dynamics at each cross-section of the domain via a rigorous
multivariate Taylor series. Then centre manifold theory supports the global
modelling of the system's emergent dynamics in the large but finite domain.
Interactions between the cross-section coupling and both fast and slow dynamics
determines quantitative error bounds for the nonlinear modelling. We illustrate
the methodology by deriving the large-scale dynamics of a thin liquid film,
where the film is subject to a Coriolis force induced by a rotating substrate.
The approach developed here quantifies the accuracy of known approximations,
extends such approximations to mixed order modelling, and may open previously

expands the word embedding matrices in projection layers and keeps the middle

possible scenarios of foreground galaxy contamination, partial coverage,

  via Knowledge Distillation",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the piracy problem of deep learning models. Designing
and training a well-performing model is generally expensive. However, when
releasing them, attackers may reverse engineer the models and pirate their
design. This paper, therefore, proposes deep learning obfuscation, aiming at
obstructing attackers from pirating a deep learning model. In particular, we
focus on obfuscating convolutional neural networks (CNN), a widely employed
type of deep learning architectures for image recognition. Our approach
obfuscates a CNN model eventually by simulating its feature extractor with a
shallow and sequential convolutional block. To this end, we employ a recursive
simulation method and a joint training method to train the simulation network.
The joint training method leverages both the intermediate knowledge generated
by a feature extractor and data labels to train a simulation network. In this
way, we can obtain an obfuscated model without accuracy loss. We have verified
the feasibility of our approach with three prevalent CNNs, i.e., GoogLeNet,
ResNet, and DenseNet. Although these networks are very deep with tens or
hundreds of layers, we can simulate them in a shallow network including only
five or seven convolutional layers. The obfuscated models are even more
efficient than the original models. Our obfuscation approach is very effective
to protect the critical structure of a deep learning model from being exposed
to attackers. Moreover, it can also thwart attackers from pirating the model
with transfer learning or incremental learning techniques because the shallow
simulation network bears poor learning ability. To our best knowledge, this
paper serves as a first attempt to obfuscate deep learning models, which may
shed light on more future studies.

these spectra are spiky and strongly depend on the way to discretize a
continuous bath (e.g., the number of the bath sites). The present scheme is
based on a recently proposed compact representation of imaginary-time Green's

This enables to extract the physically relevant part from the noisy

class of renormalization schemes, parametrized by a single real number $C$, has
been defined and investigated in the frame of the standard perturbation
expansions in powers of the coupling. In the present paper we investigate the
$C$-scheme variation of a Borel-improved QCD perturbation series, which
implements information about the large-order divergent character of
perturbation theory by means of an optimal conformal mapping of the Borel
plane. In the new expansions, the powers of the strong coupling are replaced by
a set of expansion functions with properties which resemble those of the
expanded correlators, having in particular a singular behavior at the origin of
the complex coupling plane. On the other hand, the new expansions have a tamed
increase at high orders, as demonstrated by previous studies in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme. Using as examples the Adler
function and the hadronic decay width of the $\tau$ lepton, we investigate the
properties of the Borel-improved expansions in the $C$-scheme, in comparison
with the standard expansions in the $C$-scheme and the expansions in
$\overline{\text{MS}}$. The variation with the renormalization scale and the
prescription for the choice of an optimal value of the parameter $C$ are
discussed. The good large-order behavior of the Borel-improved expansions is
proved also in the $C$-scheme, which is a further argument in favor of using
them in applications of perturbative QCD at intermediate energies.

in interstellar space through the detection of its protonated form toward the
dense clouds L483 and TMC-1. Here we present a second firm evidence of the
presence of NCCN in interstellar space, namely the detection of the metastable
and polar isomer isocyanogen (CNCN). This species has been identified in L483
and tentatively in TMC-1 by observing various rotational transitions in the 3

for CNCN of 1.6e12 cm-2 in L483 and 9e11 cm-2 in TMC-1, which imply fractional
abundances relative to H2 in the range (5-9)e-11. While the presence of NCCN in
interstellar clouds seems out of doubt owing to the detection of NCCNH+ and
CNCN, putting tight constraints on its abundance is still hampered by the poor
knowledge of the chemistry that links NCCN with NCCNH+ and especially with
CNCN. We estimate that NCCN could be fairly abundant, in the range 1e-9 - 1e-7

using event generators. These partons dynamically generate the quark gluon
plasma (QGP) fluids through the source terms in the hydrodynamic equations.
According to the core-corona picture, this process tends to happen where the
density of generated partons is high and their transverse momentum is low. Some
partons do not fully participate in this process when they are in dilute
regions or their transverse momentum is high and subsequently fragment into
hadrons through string fragmentation. In this framework, the final hadrons come
from either chemically equilibrated fluids as in the conventional hydrodynamic
models or string fragmentation. We calculate the ratio of strange baryons to
charged pions as a function of multiplicity and find that it monotonically
increases up to $dN_{\mathrm{ch}}/d\eta \sim 100$ and then saturates above.
This suggests that the QGP fluids are \textit{partly} created and that their
fraction increases with multiplicity in p+p and p+Pb collisions at LHC

the low-energy description of quantum gravity and sometimes destabilize the
spacetime. In this paper we discuss the (quasi) de Sitter instability from
gravitational backreaction involving quantum conformal anomaly. The conformal
or trace anomaly corresponds to the quantum gravitational contributions of the
massless conformal fields and affects the spacetime homogeneously. First, we
derive the conformal anomaly using the adiabatic (WKB) approximation and
discuss the renormalization of the quantum energy momentum tensor. Then, we
consider the dynamics of the Hubble parameter based on the semiclassical
Einstein's equations including the cosmological constant, the conformal anomaly
and the higher-derivative terms. We have clearly shown that the classical de
Sitter attractor $H_{\mathrm{C}} \simeq \sqrt{{\Lambda}/{3}}$ are generally
unstable from the viewpoint of the semiclassical gravity and the inflation is
destabilized except for the specific conditions. Unless the fine-tuning of the
conformal anomaly and the higher derivative terms, the inflation finally
becomes the Planckian inflation with the Hubble scale $H \approx M_{\rm

image segmentation tasks, small applicable patch size limits effective

interest (RoIs) localization from large whole volume 3D images serves as a
preceding operation that brings about multiple benefits in terms of speed,
target completeness, reduction of false positives. Distinct from sliding window
or non-joint localization-segmentation based models, we propose a novel
multitask framework referred to as 3D RoI-aware U-Net (3D RU-Net), for RoI
localization and in-region segmentation where the two tasks share one backbone
encoder network. With the region proposals from the encoder, we crop
multi-level RoI in-region features from the encoder to form a GPU
memory-efficient decoder for detailpreserving segmentation and therefore
enlarged applicable volume size and effective receptive field. To effectively
train the model, we designed a Dice formulated loss function for the
global-to-local multi-task learning procedure. Based on the efficiency gains,
we went on to ensemble models with different receptive fields to achieve even
higher performance costing minor extra computational expensiveness. Extensive
experiments were conducted on 64 cancerous cases with a four-fold
cross-validation, and the results showed significant superiority in terms of
accuracy and efficiency over conventional frameworks. In conclusion, the
proposed method has a huge potential for extension to other 3D object
segmentation tasks from medical images due to its inherent generalizability.
The code for the proposed method is publicly available.

electronic states converging to the

creates weakly-bound ground-state molecules in a well-defined level, thus

scene. However, for exploring unknown scenes, the planner must predict and
maximize usefulness of where to go on the fly. Traditionally, this has been
achieved using handcrafted utility functions. We propose to learn a better
utility function that predicts the usefulness of future viewpoints. Our learned
utility function is based on a 3D convolutional neural network. This network
takes as input a novel volumetric scene representation that implicitly captures
previously visited viewpoints and generalizes to new scenes. We evaluate our

with the immediate context. The problem is that numerous object regions exist
which potentially can all be salient. One way to prevent an exhaustive search
over all object regions is by using object proposal algorithms. These return a
limited set of regions which are most likely to contain an object. Several
saliency estimation methods have used object proposals. However, they focus on
the saliency of the proposal only, and the importance of its immediate context
has not been evaluated.
  In this paper, we aim to improve salient object detection. Therefore, we
extend object proposal methods with context proposals, which allow to
incorporate the immediate context in the saliency computation. We propose
several saliency features which are computed from the context proposals. In the
experiments, we evaluate five object proposal methods for the task of saliency
segmentation, and find that Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping outperforms the
others. Furthermore, experiments show that the proposed context features
improve performance, and that our method matches results on the FT datasets and

of light fromdistant objects can induce deflection in the flight path of the
photon. This phenomenon is called as gravitational lensing. Lensing can have
both distortion (shear) and isotropic magnification effects on the source. We
studied the effect of lensing magnification on supernova (SN) Ia in this
thesis. Presence of lensing would introduce a source of contamination to the
brightness distribution of the source (SN Ia in our case). Thus it also enables
one to compute the lensing effect indirectly from the Hubble diagram (i.e. from
the residual to the Hubble diagram). In this thesis we computed the correlation
between these two effects : the Hubble residual and the computed lensing
magnification for the SN by the line of sight foreground dark matter haloes. A
detection of positive correlation between these two would signify the
positivity of lensing signal detection. The data sample is the spectroscopic
SNe Ia sample from the five years full SNLS data and the Hubble residuals are
those of the preliminary cosmology analysis performed on SNLS5 data. We obtain
a signal of \rho = 0.177 at 2.51 \sigma. This result is consistent with the
previous SNLS three years data lensing analysis results.

physical layer authentication (PLA) protocol in mission-critical machine-type
communication (MTC) networks. The PLA protocol uses generalized
likelihood-ratio testing based on the line-of-sight (LOS), single-input
multiple-output channel-state information in order to mitigate impersonation
attempts from an adversary node. We study the detection performance, develop a
queueing model that captures the delay impacts of erroneous decisions in the
PLA (i.e., the false alarms and missed detections), and model three different
adversary strategies: data injection, disassociation, and Sybil attacks. Our
main contribution is the derivation of analytical delay performance bounds that
allow us to quantify the delay introduced by PLA that potentially can degrade
the performance in mission-critical MTC networks. For the delay analysis, we
utilize tools from stochastic network calculus. Our results show that with a
sufficient number of receive antennas (approx. 4-8) and sufficiently strong LOS
components from legitimate devices, PLA is a viable option for securing
mission-critical MTC systems, despite the low latency requirements associated
to corresponding use cases. Furthermore, we find that PLA can be very effective
in detecting the considered attacks, and in particular, it can significantly
reduce the delay impacts of disassociation and Sybil attacks.

physical phenomenon to be described by explicit laws. One motivation is to find
a consistent unification of quantum theory and gravity, in which collapse
prevents superpositions of space-times from developing. Another is to invoke
collapse to explain our perception of definite measurement outcomes. Combining
these motivations while avoiding two different collapse postulates seems to
require that perceptibly different physical states necessarily create
significantly different mass distributions in our organs of perception or
brains. Bassi et al. investigated this question in the context of mass density
dependent spontaneous collapse models. By analysing the mechanism of visual
perception of a few photons in the human eye, they argued that collapse model
parameters consistent with known experiment imply that a collapse would take
place in the eye within the human perception time of ~100ms, so that a definite
state of observing some or no photons would be created from an initial
superposition. I reanalyse their arguments, and note a key problem: they treat
the relevant processes as though they take place in vacuo, rather than in
cytoplasm. This makes a significant difference, since the models imply that
superpositions collapse at rates that depend on the difference between the
coarse grained mass densities of their components. This increases the required
collapse rate, most likely by at least an order of magnitude and plausibly by
significantly more. This casts some doubt on the claim that there are collapse
model parameters consistent with known experiment that imply collapse times of
<~ 100ms within the human eye. A complete analysis would require a very
detailed understanding of the physical chemistry and biology of rod cells at
microscopic scales.

recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multineuronal spike pattern
detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and
recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to
different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure
is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike
latency, that enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and
heterosynaptic plasticity, that allows the own regulation of synaptic weights.
From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows
mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multidimensional, temporal, feature
space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron
fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be
considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to
experimental data obtained from a motor inhibitory cognitive task. The test
exhibits good classification performance, indicating the adequateness of our
approach. In addition to its effectiveness, its simplicity and low

a more general choice model -- the nested logit model, which models
hierarchical choice behavior and is ``the most widely used member of the GEV
(generalized extreme value) family''. By leveraging the revenue-ordered
structure of the optimal assortment within each nest, we develop a novel upper
confidence bound (UCB) policy with an aggregated estimation scheme. Our policy
simultaneously learns customers' choice behavior and makes dynamic decisions on
assortments based on the current knowledge. It achieves the accumulated regret
at the order of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{MNT})$, where $M$ is the number of nests and
$N$ is the number of products in each nest. We further provide a lower bound
result of $\Omega(\sqrt{MT})$, which shows the near optimality of the upper

gives rise to several species of fundamental discrete solitons, which exist in
continuous families, although the system is non-Hermitian. The existence and
stability of the soliton families are explored by means of analytical and
numerical methods. An asymptotic analysis is presented for the case of weak

coupling between cores in each dimer. Several families of fundamental discrete
solitons are found in the semi-infinite gap of the system's spectrum, that have
no counterparts in the continuum limit, as well as a branch which belongs to
the finite band gap and carries over into a family of stable gap solitons in

strength of the intersite coupling, others being stable in their entire
existence regions. Unlike solitons in conservative lattices, which are
controlled solely by the strength of the intersite coupling, here
fundamental-soliton families have several control parameters, one of which,

fraction thereof) has attracted much attention recently. Their spatial
clustering is a fundamental property which determines, among others, whether
current observational constraints are evaded within a given mass range, whether
merging is significant and whether primordial black holes could generate
cosmological structure. We treat them as discrete objects and clarify the issue
of their spatial clustering, with an emphasis on short-range exclusion and its
impact on their large scale power spectrum. Even if a Poissonian self-pair term
is always present in the zero-lag correlation, this does not necessarily imply
that primordial black holes are initially Poisson distributed. However, while
the initial PBH clustering depends on the detailed shape of the small-scale

mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) patients from their diffusion magnetic
resonance images (MRI) (obtained within one month of injury) by incorporating
unsupervised feature learning techniques. MTBI is a growing public health
problem with an estimated incidence of over 1.7 million people annually in US.
Diagnosis is based on clinical history and symptoms, and accurate, concrete
measures of injury are lacking. Unlike most of previous works, which use
hand-crafted features extracted from different parts of brain for MTBI
classification, we employ feature learning algorithms to learn more
discriminative representation for this task. A major challenge in this field
thus far is the relatively small number of subjects available for training.
This makes it difficult to use an end-to-end convolutional neural network to
directly classify a subject from MR images. To overcome this challenge, we
first apply an adversarial auto-encoder (with convolutional structure) to learn
patch-level features, from overlapping image patches extracted from different
brain regions. We then aggregate these features through a bag-of-word approach.
We perform an extensive experimental study on a dataset of 227 subjects
(including 109 MTBI patients, and 118 age and sex matched healthy controls),
and compare the bag-of-deep-features with several previous approaches. Our
experimental results show that the BAF significantly outperforms earlier works

information in fast and reliable way to generate successful behaviors.
Therefore, significant brain resources are devoted to process spatiotemporal
information. Neural basis of spatial processing and their cognitive correlates
are well established mostly for static environments. Nonetheless, in
time-changing situations the brain exploits specific processing mechanisms for
temporal information based on prediction and anticipation, as time compression
during visual perception and mental navigation. Alternative hypothesis of time
compaction integrates both views, postulating that dynamic situations are
internally represented as static spatial maps where temporal information is
extracted by predicting and structuring the relevant interactions.
Nevertheless, empirical approaches tackling the biological soundness of time
compaction are still lacking. Here we show that performance in a discrimination
learning task involving dynamic situations can be either favored or hampered
via previous exposition to interfering static scenes. In this sense, men were
effectively conditioned in contrast to a control group, in coherence with the
hypothesis. Meanwhile, women performed on par with control men, regardless of
the previous conditioning. This suggests time compaction is a salient cognitive
strategy in men when dealing with dynamic situations, while women seem to rely
on a broader range of information processing strategies. Finally, we further
corroborated the time compaction mechanism involved in these experimental
findings through a mathematical model of the experimental process. Our results
point to some form of static internal representation mechanism at cognitive

  equations","in French",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the
Navier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent
chapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's
dissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic
setting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a
stationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and
on the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the
Kolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in
the form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.
Kolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of
statistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research
area consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the
Navier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion
and in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the
purpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the
Navier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for
the study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition
and then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the
Navier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of
these damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation
rate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are
interested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes
introduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular
type of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study
is motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations
with a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of
the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these
solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then
all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal
variables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns
the decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of
stationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the
Navier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary
solutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical
equations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is
to study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the
turbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according
to the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency
decay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent
setting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs
frequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a
precise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in
the turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the
stationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the
uniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external
force. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these
solutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a
general framework of Morrey spaces.

on the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations are expected to play
an important role in decades to come. However, model uncertainties are still a
major obstacle for the predictive capability of RANS simulations. This review
examines both the parametric and structural uncertainties in turbulence models.
We review recent literature on data-free (uncertainty propagation) and
data-driven (statistical inference) approaches for quantifying and reducing
model uncertainties in RANS simulations. Moreover, the fundamentals of
uncertainty propagation and Bayesian inference are introduced in the context of
RANS model uncertainty quantification. Finally, the literature on uncertainties
in scale-resolving simulations is briefly reviewed with particular emphasis on
large eddy simulations.

similar to Turing machines but beyond computation on natural numbers, e.g.,
higher-order computation. As the main theorem of the work, it has been shown
that the game-semantic model may execute all the computation of the programming
language PCF. The present paper revisits this result from an automata-theoretic
perspective: It shows that deterministic non-erasing pushdown automata whose
input tape is equipped with simple directed edges between cells can implement
all the game-semantic PCF-computation, where the edges rather restrict the
cells of the tape which the automata may read off. This is a mathematically
highly-surprising phenomenon because it is well-known that the more powerful
non-deterministic erasing pushdown automata are strictly weaker than Turing
machines (in the Chomsky hierarchy), let alone than PCF.

consequently the appearance of an extra force. The motivation is to verify
whether the subtle improvement of the geometrical formulation, when implemented

realisations of the nonminimal curvature-matter coupling theories. Furthermore,
we consider several cosmological applications by presenting the evolution
equations and imposing specific functional forms of the functions $f_1(Q)$ and

superconductivity is described by BCS model, up to the limit of very strong

temperatures paramagnetic critical magnetic field $H_{cp}$ grows with $U$ much
slower, than the orbital critical field, and in BCS limit the main contribution
to the upper critical magnetic filed is of paramagnetic origin. The growth of
the coupling strength also leads to the disappearance of the low temperature

Disordering leads to the rapid drop of $H_{cp}(T)$ in BCS weak coupling limit,

on disorder is rather weak. Within DMFT+$\Sigma$ approach disorder influence on
$H_{cp}(T)$ is of universal nature at any coupling strength and related only to
disorder widening of the conduction band. In particular, this leads to the drop
of the effective coupling strength with disorder, so that disordering restores

spectrum trading process. It is assumed that no RF spectrum is preallocated to
the FSO link and only when the link availability is severely impaired by the
infrequent adverse weather conditions, i.e. fog, etc., the source can borrow a
portion of licensed RF spectrum from one of the surrounding RF nodes. Using the
leased spectrum, the source establishes a dual-hop RF/FSO hybrid link to
maintain its throughout to the destination. The proposed system is considered
to be both spectrum- and power-efficient. A market-equilibrium-based pricing
process is proposed for the spectrum trading between the source and RF nodes.
Through extensive performance analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed
scheme can significantly improve the average capacity of the system, especially
when the surrounding RF nodes are with low traffic loads. In addition, the
system benefits from involving more RF nodes into the spectrum trading process
by means of diversity, particularly when the surrounding RF nodes have high
probability of being in heavy traffic loads. Furthermore, the application of
the proposed system in a realistic scenario is presented based on the weather
statistics in the city of Edinburgh, UK. It is demonstrated that the proposed
system can substantially enhance the link availability towards the
carrier-class requirement.

the measured scattering information to modify the template used for generating

membranes or the extracellular matrix in the exterior, as well as with internal
cellular structures such as the cytoskeleton. Characterization of the dynamic
properties of such interactions presents a difficult task. Significant progress
has been achieved through simulations and experiments, yet analytical progress
in modelling pinned membranes has been impeded by the complexity of governing
equations. Here we circumvent these difficulties by calculating analytically
the time-dependent Green's function of the operator governing the dynamics of
an elastically pinned membrane in a hydrodynamic surrounding and subject to
external forces. This enables us to calculate the equilibrium power spectral
density for an overdamped membrane pinned by an elastic, permanently-attached
spring subject to thermal excitations. By considering the effects of the finite
experimental resolution on the measured spectra, we show that the elasticity of
the pinning can be extracted from the experimentally measured spectrum.
Membrane fluctuations can thus be used as a tool to probe mechanical properties
of the underlying structures. Such a tool may be particularly relevant in the
context of cell mechanics, where the elasticity of the membrane's attachment to
the cytoskeleton could be measured.

analyzed using both numerical simulations and zonally symmetric theories,
focusing largely on the limit of low planetary rotation rate. Two versions of a
zonally symmetric theory are considered, the standard Held-Hou model, which
features a discontinuous zonal wind at the edge of the Hadley cell, and a
variant with continuous zonal wind but discontinuous temperature. The two
models have different scalings for the boundary latitude and zonal wind.
Numerical simulations are found to have smoother temperature profiles than
either model, with no temperature or velocity discontinuities even in zonally
symmetric simulations. Continuity is achieved because of the presence of an
overturning circulation poleward of the point of maximum zonal wind, which
allows the zonal velocity profile to be smoother than the original theory
without the temperature discontinuities of the variant theory. Zonally
symmetric simulations generally fall between the two sets of theoretical
scalings, and have a faster polar zonal flow than either. Three-dimensional
simulations that allow for eddy motion fall closer to the scalings of the
variant model. At very low rotation rates the maximum zonal wind falls with
falling planetary rotation rate, even in the three-dimensional simulations, and
collapses completely at zero rotation. Nevertheless, the low-rotation limit of
the overturning circulation is strong enough to drive the temperature profile
close to a state of nearly constant potential temperature.

prediction models should be studied in patients that were not part of the data

predictors are measured differently at derivation and external validation. This
may occur, for instance, when predictors are measured using different
measurement protocols or when tests are produced by different manufacturers.
Although such heterogeneity in predictor measurement between deriviation and
validation data is common, the impact on the out-of-sample performance is not
well studied. Using analytical and simulation approaches, we examined
out-of-sample performance of prediction models under various scenarios of
heterogeneous predictor measurement. These scenarios were defined and clarified
using an established taxonomy of measurement error models. The results of our
simulations indicate that predictor measurement heterogeneity can induce
miscalibration of prediction and affects discrimination and overall predictive
accuracy, to extents that the prediction model may no longer be considered
clinically useful. The measurement error taxonomy was found to be helpful in
identifying and predicting effects of heterogeneous predictor measurements
between settings of prediction model derivation and validation. Our work
indicates that homogeneity of measurement strategies across settings is of
paramount importance in prediction research.

We propose a non-perturbation-based framework that generates native adversarial

diversity, raising the difficulty in adversarial defense. We then extend this
framework to pre-trained conditional GANs, in which we turn an existing

vortices (LEVs) in revolving wings. Previous studies suggested that Coriolis
acceleration and spanwise flow both played key roles in stabilizing the LEV;
however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. The current study examined a
mechanism that relates the effects of Coriolis acceleration, spanwise flow, and
the tilting of the planetary vortex on limiting the growth of the LEV.
Specifically, this mechanism states that a vertical gradient in spanwise flow
can create a vertical gradient in Coriolis acceleration, which will in turn
produce oppositely-signed vorticity within the LEV. This gradient of Coriolis
acceleration corresponds to the spanwise (radial) component of planetary vortex
tilting (PVTr) that reorients the planetary vortex into the spanwise direction
therefore creating oppositely-signed LEV vorticity. Using an in-house,
immersed-boundary-method flow solver, this mechanism was investigated alongside
the other vorticity dynamics for revolving wings of varying aspect ratio (AR=3,
5, and 7) and Reynolds number (Re=110, and 1400). Analyses of vorticity
dynamics showed that the PVTr consistently produced oppositely-signed vorticity
for all values of AR and Re investigated, although other three-dimensional
phenomena play a similar but more dominant role when Re = 1400. In addition,
the relative strength of the PVTr increased with increasing AR due to a
decrease in the magnitude of advection. Finally, the effects of AR and Re on
the vorticity dynamics and LEV stability were also investigated.

tree that minimizes the total search cost. Constructing perfectly optimal
binary search trees is expensive so the most efficient algorithms construct
almost optimal search trees. There exists a long literature of constructing
almost optimal search trees dynamically, i.e., when the access pattern is not
known in advance. All of these trees, e.g., splay trees and treaps, provide a
multiplicative approximation to the optimal search cost.
  In this paper we show how to maintain an almost optimal weighted binary
search tree under access operations and insertions of new elements where the
approximation is an additive constant. More technically, we maintain a tree in
which the depth of the leaf holding an element $e_i$ does not exceed
$\min(\log(W/w_i),\log n)+O(1)$ where $w_i$ is the number of times $e_i$ was
accessed and $W$ is the total length of the access sequence.
  Our techniques can also be used to encode a sequence of $m$ symbols with a
dynamic alphabetic code in $O(m)$ time so that the encoding length is bounded
by $m(H+O(1))$, where $H$ is the entropy of the sequence. This is the first
efficient algorithm for adaptive alphabetic coding that runs in constant time
per symbol.

combinatorial optimization. The $q$-Coloring problem has been studied
intensively using the framework of parameterized algorithmics, resulting in a
very good understanding of the best-possible algorithms for several
parameterizations based on the structure of the graph. While there is an
abundance of work for parameterizations based on decompositions of the graph by
vertex separators, almost nothing is known about parameterizations based on
edge separators. We fill this gap by studying $q$-Coloring parameterized by
cutwidth, and parameterized by pathwidth in bounded-degree graphs. Our research
uncovers interesting new ways to exploit small edge separators.
  We present two algorithms for $q$-Coloring parameterized by cutwidth $cutw$:
a deterministic one that runs in time $O^*(2^{\omega \cdot cutw})$, where
$\omega$ is the matrix multiplication constant, and a randomized one with
runtime $O^*(2^{cutw})$. In sharp contrast to earlier work, the running time is
independent of $q$. The dependence on cutwidth is optimal: we prove that even
3-Coloring cannot be solved in $O^*((2-\varepsilon)^{cutw})$ time assuming the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Our algorithms rely on a new rank
bound for a matrix that describes compatible colorings. Combined with a simple
communication protocol for evaluating a product of two polynomials, this also
yields an $O^*((\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1)^{pw})$ time randomized algorithm for
$q$-Coloring on graphs of pathwidth $pw$ and maximum degree $d$. Such a runtime
was first obtained by Bj\""orklund, but only for graphs with few proper
colorings. We also prove that this result is optimal in the sense that no
$O^*((\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1-\varepsilon)^{pw})$-time algorithm exists assuming
SETH.

discussions and easier to calculate due to its nature of being linear algebra
dealing with linear perturbations. We utilize this advantage to have resolved
the IR suppression problem. We also propose the field-free approximation for
the effective mass in the quantum bounce epoch to largely improve the accuracy
in the predicted GW power spectrum. Our transfer-function formalism is general
in dealing with any linear problems, and thus expected to be equally useful
under other context with linearity.

different types of degrees of freedom, the translational and the internal
energy degrees of freedom. Therefore, in the case of BGK models one expects two
types of relaxations, a relaxation of the distribution function to a Maxwell
distribution and a relaxation of the two temperatures to an equal value. The
speed for the first type of relaxation may be faster or slower than the second
type of relaxation. Models found in the literature often allow only for one of
these two cases. We believe that a model should allow for both cases. That is
why we derive a new multi-species polyatomic BGK model which allows for both
regimes. For this new model we prove conservation properties, positivity of the
temperatures, the H-theorem and characterize the equilibrium as a Maxwell
distribution with equal temperatures. Moreover, we prove the convergence rate
to equilibrium and that we can actually capture both regimes of the relaxation
processes.

medium access techniques based on carrier sensing cannot provide the required
reliability for industrial applications. Therefore, the standard was extended
with techniques for time-slotted medium access on multiple channels. In this
paper, we present openDSME, a comprehensive implementation of the Deterministic

traffic-aware and decentralized slot scheduling to enable scalable wireless
industrial networks. The performance of DSME and our implementation is
demonstrated in the OMNeT++ simulator and on a physically deployed wireless
network in the FIT/IoT-LAB. It is shown that in the given scenarios, twice as
much traffic can be delivered reliably by using DSME instead of CSMA/CA and
that the energy consumption can be reduced significantly. The paper is
completed by presenting important trade-offs for parameter selection and by
uncovering open issues of the current specification that call for further

is investigated by solving the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations using
direct numerical simulations with droplets being modeled as Lagrangian
particles. The supersaturation field is calculated directly by simulating the
temperature and water vapor fields instead of being treated as a passive
scalar. Thermodynamic feedbacks to the fields due to condensation are also
included for completeness. We find that the width of droplet size distributions
increases with time, which is contrary to the classical theory without
supersaturation fluctuations, where condensational growth leads to
progressively narrower size distributions. Nevertheless, in agreement with
earlier Lagrangian stochastic models of the condensational growth, the standard
deviation of the surface area of droplets increases as $t^{1/2}$. Also, for the
first time, we explicitly demonstrate that the time evolution of the size
distribution is sensitive to the Reynolds number, but insensitive to the mean
energy dissipation rate. This is shown to be due to the fact that temperature
fluctuations and water vapor mixing ratio fluctuations increases with
increasing Reynolds number, therefore the resulting supersaturation
fluctuations are enhanced with increasing Reynolds number. Our simulations may
explain the broadening of the size distribution in stratiform clouds
qualitatively, where the mean updraft velocity is almost zero.

representing errors in forecasting renewable energy ramp events. Standard Monte
Carlo sampling approaches can result in prohibitively high-dimensional systems
for optimization, as well as a poor representation of extreme events that
challenge grid reliability. We propose two alternative scenario creation
strategies, importance sampling and Bayesian quadrature, that can reduce the
estimator's variance. Their performance is assessed on a week's worth of 5
minute stochastic economic dispatch decisions for realistic wind and electrical
system data. Both strategies yield more economic solutions and improved
reliability compared to Monte Carlo sampling, with Bayesian quadrature being
less computationally intensive than importance sampling and more economic when
considering at least 20 scenarios.

needed for precise stellar modelling. Atomic diffusion by gravitational
settling nowadays is usually taken into account, and is essential for
helioseismic studies. On the other hand, radiative accelerations are rarely
accounted for, act differently on the various chemical elements, and can
strongly counteract gravity in some stellar mass domains. In this study we aim
at determining whether radiative accelerations impact the structure of
solar-like oscillating main-sequence stars observed by asteroseismic space
missions. We implemented the calculation of radiative accelerations in the
CESTAM code using the Single-Valued Parameter method. We built and compared
several grids of stellar models including gravitational settling, but some with
and others without radiative accelerations. We found that radiative
accelerations may not be neglected for stellar masses larger than
1.1~M$_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity. The difference in age due to their
inclusion in models can reach 9\% for the more massive stars of our grids. We
estimated that the percentage of the PLATO core program stars whose modelling
would require radiative accelerations ranges between 33 and 58\% depending on
the precision of the seismic data. We conclude that, in the context of Kepler,
TESS, and PLATO missions, which provide (or will provide) high quality seismic
data, radiative accelerations can have a significant effect when inferring the
properties of solar-like oscillators properly. This is particularly important
for age inferences. However, the net effect for each individual star results
from the competition between atomic diffusion including radiative accelerations
and other internal transport processes. This will be investigated in a
forthcoming companion paper.

important component for proposed topological and hybrid quantum computing (QC)

large capacitance, coupled to a high quality factor superconducting resonator.
In conventional transmon devices, the JJ is made from an Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel
junction which ceases operation above the critical magnetic field of Al, 10 mT.
Alternative junction technologies are therefore required to push the operation
of these qubits into strong magnetic fields. Graphene JJs are one such
candidate due to their high quality, ballistic transport and electrically
tunable critical current densities. Importantly the monolayer structure of
graphene protects the JJ from orbital interference effects that would otherwise
inhibit operation at high magnetic field. Here we report the integration of
ballistic graphene JJs into microwave frequency superconducting circuits to
create the first graphene transmons. The electric tunability allows the
characteristic band dispersion of graphene to be resolved via dispersive
microwave spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the device is insensitive to the

simulations that significantly improves the precision with respect to current

galaxy shape changes with the small applied shear. This shear response is the
multiplicative shear bias for each image. In addition, we also measured the
individual additive bias. Using the same noise realizations for each sheared
version allows us to compute the shear response at very high precision. The
estimated shear bias of a sample of galaxies is then the average of the
individual measurements. The precision of this method leads to an improvement
with respect to previous methods concerned with the precision of estimates of
multiplicative bias since our method is not affected by noise from shape
measurements, which until now has been the dominant uncertainty. As a
consequence, the method does not require shape-noise suppression for a precise
estimation of shear multiplicative bias. Our method can be readily used for
numerous applications such as shear measurement validation and calibration,
reducing the number of necessary simulated images by a few orders of magnitude
to achieve the same precision.

dominating electronic and magnetic properties of the entire system dynamically
change with the amount of the Mn overlayer. Element specific magnetization
curves of the Fe layer exhibit a two-step spin reorientation transition from

Atomic-scale characterizations of structural and electronic properties in
combination with the first-principles calculations successfully unravel the

the transition. The first step of the transition at a low Mn coverage is
dominantly induced by the formation of FeMn disordered alloy at the

both of which appeared in association with Earth's crossing of the heliospheric
current sheet (HCS). This enhanced anisotropy was normal to the HCS and
consistent with a diamagnetic drift arising from the spatial gradient of cosmic
ray density, which indicates that cosmic rays were drifting along the HCS from
the north of Earth. We also find a significant anisotropy along the HCS,
lasting a few hours after the HCS crossing, indicating that cosmic rays
penetrated into the inner heliosphere along the HCS. Based on the latest
geomagnetic field model, we quantitatively evaluate the reduction of the
geomagnetic cut-off rigidity and the variation of the asymptotic viewing
direction of cosmic rays due to a major geomagnetic storm which occurred during
the CRB and conclude that the CRB is not caused by the geomagnetic storm, but
by a rapid change in the cosmic ray anisotropy and density outside the

  Iterative Update","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1803.06282",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing studies have shown that the conventional multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on decomposition may lose the population
diversity when solving some many-objective optimization problems. In this
paper, a simple decomposition-based MOEA with local iterative update (LIU) is
proposed. The LIU strategy has two features that are expected to drive the
population to approximate the Pareto Front with good distribution. One is that
only the worst solution in the current neighborhood is swapped out by the newly
generated offspring, preventing the population from being occupied by copies of
a few individuals. The other is that its iterative process helps to assign
better solutions to subproblems, which is beneficial to make full use of the
similarity of solutions to neighboring subproblems and explore local areas in
the search space. In addition, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is
the same as that of MOEA/D, and lower than that of other known MOEAs, since it
considers only individuals within the current neighborhood at each update. The
algorithm is compared with several of the best MOEAs on problems chosen from
two famous test suites DTLZ and WFG. Experimental results demonstrate that only
a handful of running instances of the algorithm on DTLZ4 lose their population
diversity. What's more, the algorithm wins in most of the test instances in
terms of both running time and solution quality, indicating that it is very
effective in solving MaOPs.

mind. The basic trends in psychophysics development are briefly discussed with
special attention focused on Teghtsoonian's hypotheses. These hypotheses pose
the concept of the universality of inner psychophysics and enable to speak
about psychological space as an individual object with its own properties.
Turning to the two-component description of human behavior (I. Lubashevsky,
Physics of the Human Mind, Springer, 2017) the notion of mental space is
formulated and human perception of external stimuli is treated as the emergence
of the corresponding images in the mental space. On one hand, these images are
caused by external stimuli and their magnitude bears the information about the
intensity of the corresponding stimuli. On the other hand, the individual
structure of such images as well as their subsistence after emergence is
determined only by the properties of mental space on its own. Finally, the
mental operations of image comparison and their scaling are defined in a way
allowing for the bounded capacity of human cognition. As demonstrated, the
developed theory of stimulus perception is able to explain the basic
regularities of psychophysics, e.g., (i) the regression and range effects
leading to the overestimation of weak stimuli and the underestimation of strong
stimuli, (ii) scalar variability (Weber's and Ekman' laws), and (\textit{iii})
the sequential (memory) effects. As the final result, a solution to the
Fechner-Stevens dilemma is proposed. This solution posits that Fechner's
logarithmic law is not a consequences of Weber's law but stems from the
interplay of uncertainty in evaluating stimulus intensities and the multi-step
scaling required to overcome the stimulus incommensurability.

"1807.01369","Michael Fiske S","Michael Stephen Fiske","Quantum Random Self-Modifiable Computation","50 pages, 3 figures. Computational Intelligence Series, Springer,
  2021",,"10.1007/978-3-030-70873-3_27",,"cs.CC cs.LO quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Among the fundamental questions in computer science, at least two have a deep
impact on mathematics. What can computation compute? How many steps does a
computation require to solve an instance of the 3-SAT problem? Our work
addresses the first question, by introducing a new model called the ex-machine.
The ex-machine executes Turing machine instructions and two special types of
instructions. Quantum random instructions are physically realizable with a
quantum random number generator. Meta instructions can add new states and add
new instructions to the ex-machine. A countable set of ex-machines is
constructed, each with a finite number of states and instructions; each
ex-machine can compute a Turing incomputable language, whenever the quantum
randomness measurements behave like unbiased Bernoulli trials. In 1936, Alan
Turing posed the halting problem for Turing machines and proved that this
problem is unsolvable for Turing machines. Consider an enumeration E_a(i) =
(M_i, T_i) of all Turing machines M_i and initial tapes T_i. Does there exist
an ex-machine X that has at least one evolutionary path X --> X_1 --> X_2 --> .
. . --> X_m, so at the mth stage ex-machine X_m can correctly determine for 0
<= i <= m whether M_i's execution on tape T_i eventually halts? We demonstrate
an ex-machine Q(x) that has one such evolutionary path. The existence of this
evolutionary path suggests that David Hilbert was not misguided to propose in
1900 that mathematicians search for finite processes to help construct
mathematical proofs. Our refinement is that we cannot use a fixed computer
program that behaves according to a fixed set of mechanical rules. We must
pursue methods that exploit randomness and self-modification so that the
complexity of the program can increase as it computes.

  BiFeO3 structure and the effect of synthesis method",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the photocatalytic activity of multiferroics BiFeO3 (BFO) and
Bi0.8La0.2FeO3 (BLFO) nanocrystals with two different morphologies which were
synthesized by two different sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods have
been studied. All the obtained samples were characterized using X-ray
diffractometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. Differential
thermal analysis (DTA) measurements were probed ferroelectric- paraelectric
first-order phase transition (TC) for all samples. Addition of lanthanum
decreases the electric phase transition. For photocatalyst application of
bismuth ferrite, adsorption potential of nanoparticles for methylene blue (MB)
organic dye was evaluated. The doping of La in the BFO structure enhanced the
photocatalytic activity and about 71% degradation of MB dye was obtained under
visible irradiation. The magnetic and ferroelectric properties of BLFO
nanoparticles improve compared to the undoped BiFeO3 nanoparticles. The
non-saturation at high applied magnetic field for as-prepared samples by HT is
related to the size and shape of products. This work not only presents an
effect of lanthanum substitution into the bismuth ferrite structure on the
physical properties of BFO, but also compares the synthesis method and its
influence on the photocatalytic activity and multiferroics properties of all
nanopowders.

measured. Here we show that the neutron interaction time with barriers
corresponds to the universal tunneling time of wave mechanics, which was
formerly observed with elastic, electromagnetic, and electron waves. The
universal tunneling time seems to also hold for neutrons. Such an adequate
general wave mechanical behavior was conjectured by Brillouin. Remarkably, wave
mechanical effects and even virtual particles hold from the microcosmos up to
the macrocosmos.

processes and ceramic-polycrystalline evolutions, termed the normal grain
growth (NGG), as adopted to soft- and chemically-reactive grains, with a
Smoluchowski's population-constant kernel cluster-cluster aggregation (CCA)
model, concerning irreversible chemical reaction kinetics. The former aiming at
comprehending, in a semi-quantitative way, the volume-conservative
(pressure-drifted) grain-growth process which we propose to adopt for hydrogel
systems at quite low temperature (near a gel point). It has been noticed, that
by identifying the mean cluster size $<k>$ from the Smoluchowski CCA
description with the mean cluster radius' size $R_D$, from the NGG approach of
proximate grains, one is able to embark on equivalence of both frameworks, but
only under certain conditions. For great enough, close-packed clusters, the
equivalence can be obtained by rearranging the time domain with rescaled time
variable, where the scaling function originates from the dispersive (long-tail,
or fractal) kinetics, with a single exponent equal to $d+1$ (in $d$-dimensional
(Euclidean) space). This can be of interest for experimenters, working in the
field of thermoresponsive gels formation, where crystalline structural
predispositions overwhelm.
