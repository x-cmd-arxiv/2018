  Investigation of an automated adversarial attack using neural networks","To be presented at RSNA 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  $\textbf{Purpose}$ To train a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network
(CycleGAN) on mammographic data to inject or remove features of malignancy, and
to determine whether these AI-mediated attacks can be detected by radiologists.
$\textbf{Material and Methods}$ From the two publicly available datasets, BCDR
and INbreast, we selected images from cancer patients and healthy controls. An
internal dataset served as test data, withheld during training. We ran two
experiments training CycleGAN on low and higher resolution images ($256 \times
256$ px and $512 \times 408$ px). Three radiologists read the images and rated
the likelihood of malignancy on a scale from 1-5 and the likelihood of the
image being manipulated. The readout was evaluated by ROC analysis (Area under
the ROC curve = AUC). $\textbf{Results}$ At the lower resolution, only one
radiologist exhibited markedly lower detection of cancer (AUC=0.85 vs 0.63,
p=0.06), while the other two were unaffected (0.67 vs. 0.69 and 0.75 vs. 0.77,
p=0.55). Only one radiologist could discriminate between original and modified
images slightly better than guessing/chance (0.66, p=0.008). At the higher
resolution, all radiologists showed significantly lower detection rate of
cancer in the modified images (0.77-0.84 vs. 0.59-0.69, p=0.008), however, they
were now able to reliably detect modified images due to better visibility of
artifacts (0.92, 0.92 and 0.97). $\textbf{Conclusion}$ A CycleGAN can
implicitly learn malignant features and inject or remove them so that a
substantial proportion of small mammographic images would consequently be
misdiagnosed. At higher resolutions, however, the method is currently limited
and has a clear trade-off between manipulation of images and introduction of
artifacts.

Fluid Mech (in press)",,"10.1017/jfm.2018.954",,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Raylaigh-Benard convection is one of the most well-studied models in fluid
mechanics. Atmospheric convection, one of the most important components of the
climate system, is by comparison complicated and poorly understood. A key
attribute of atmospheric convection is the buoyancy source provided by the
condensation of water vapour, but the presence of radiation, compressibility,
liquid water and ice further complicate the system and our understanding of it.
In this paper we present an idealized model of moist convection by taking the
Boussinesq limit of the ideal gas equations and adding a condensate that obeys
a simplified Clausius--Clapeyron relation. The system allows moist convection
to be explored at a fundamental level and reduces to the classical
Rayleigh-Benard model if the latent heat of condensation is taken to be zero.
The model has an exact, Rayleigh-number independent `drizzle' solution in which
the diffusion of water vapour from a saturated lower surface is balanced by
condensation, with the temperature field (and so the saturation value of the
moisture) determined self-consistently by the heat released in the
condensation. This state is the moist analogue of the conductive solution in
the classical problem. We numerically determine the linear stability properties
of this solution as a function of Rayleigh number and a nondimensional
latent-heat parameter. We also present a number of turbulent solutions.

search for planetary signals to be fitted using differential evolution MCMC
single-Keplerian models. We then join our detections to the results of the
previous HARPS survey on 88 metal-poor stars to provide a preliminar estimate

M$\sin{i}=0.20_{-0.04}^{+0.07}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ and orbital period of

giant planets around metal-poor stars. The two new giant planets orbit dwarf
stars at the metal-rich end of the HARPS-N metal-poor sample, corroborating
previous results suggesting that giant planet frequency still is a rising
function of host star [Fe/H]. We also note that all detections in the overall
sample are giant long-period planets.

transition linewidths, measure electron spin lifetimes and evaluate the spin
dephasing time. We find that the optical transitions are consistent with the
radiative lifetime limit even in nanofabricated structures. The spin lifetime
is phononlimited with an exponential temperature scaling leading to $T_1$ $>$
10 ms, and the coherence time, $T_2$ reaches the nuclear spin-bath limit upon
cooling to 2.9 K. These spin properties exceed those of other
inversion-symmetric color centers for which similar values require millikelvin
temperatures. With a combination of coherent optical transitions and long spin
coherence without dilution refrigeration, the SnV is a promising candidate for
feasable and scalable quantum networking applications.

target graph $H$; the goal is to estimate the number of occurrences of $H$ in
$G$. Our focus here is on designing sublinear-time algorithms for approximately
counting occurrences of $H$ in $G$ in the setting where the algorithm is given
query access to $G$. This problem has been studied in several recent papers
which primarily focused on specific families of graphs $H$ such as triangles,
cliques, and stars. However, not much is known about approximate counting of
arbitrary graphs $H$. This is in sharp contrast to the closely related subgraph
enumeration problem that has received significant attention in the database
community as the database join problem. The AGM bound shows that the maximum
number of occurrences of any arbitrary subgraph $H$ in a graph $G$ with $m$
edges is $O(m^{\rho(H)})$, where $\rho(H)$ is the fractional edge-cover of $H$,
and enumeration algorithms with matching runtime are known for any $H$.
  We bridge this gap between subgraph counting and subgraph enumeration by
designing a sublinear-time algorithm that can estimate the number of any
arbitrary subgraph $H$ in $G$, denoted by $\#H$, to within a $(1\pm
\epsilon)$-approximation w.h.p. in $O(\frac{m^{\rho(H)}}{\#H}) \cdot
poly(\log{n},1/\epsilon)$ time. Our algorithm is allowed the standard set of
queries for general graphs, namely degree queries, pair queries and neighbor
queries, plus an additional edge-sample query that returns an edge chosen
uniformly at random. The performance of our algorithm matches those of Eden
et.al. [FOCS 2015, STOC 2018] for counting triangles and cliques and extend
them to all choices of subgraph $H$ under the additional assumption of
edge-sample queries. We further show that our algorithm works for the more
general database join size estimation problem and prove a matching lower bound
for this problem.

researchers to adapt CNNs to directly model points in 3D point clouds. Modeling
local structure has been proven to be important for the success of
convolutional architectures, and researchers exploited the modeling of local
point sets in the feature extraction hierarchy. However, limited attention has
been paid to explicitly model the geometric structure amongst points in a local
region. To address this problem, we propose Geo-CNN, which applies a generic
convolution-like operation dubbed as GeoConv to each point and its local
neighborhood. Local geometric relationships among points are captured when
extracting edge features between the center and its neighboring points. We
first decompose the edge feature extraction process onto three orthogonal
bases, and then aggregate the extracted features based on the angles between
the edge vector and the bases. This encourages the network to preserve the
geometric structure in Euclidean space throughout the feature extraction
hierarchy. GeoConv is a generic and efficient operation that can be easily
integrated into 3D point cloud analysis pipelines for multiple applications. We
evaluate Geo-CNN on ModelNet40 and KITTI and achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

imagery resolve a broken ring structure surrounding HD 163296 that peaks at a
distance along the major axis of 0.65 (66 AU) and extends out to 0.98 (100 AU)
along the major axis. Our 2011 H-band data exhibit clear axisymmetry, with the
NW- and SE- side of the disk exhibiting similar intensities. Our data are
clearly different than 2016 epoch H-band observations from VLT/SPHERE that
found a strong 2.7x asymmetry between the NW- and SE-side of the disk.
Collectively, these results indicate the presence of time variable,
non-azimuthally symmetric illumination of the outer disk. Based on our 3D-MCRT
modeling of contemporaneous IR spectroscopic and H-band polarized intensity
imagery of the system, we suggest that while the system could plausibly host an
inclined inner disk component, such a component is unlikely to be responsible
for producing the observed time-dependent azimuthal variations in the outer
scattered light disk of the system. While our SCExAO/CHARIS data are sensitive
enough to recover the planet candidate identified from NIRC2 in the thermal IR,
we fail to detect an object with a corresponding JHK brightness estimated from
the atmospheric models of Baraffe et al. 2003. This suggests that the candidate
is either fainter in JHK bands than model predictions, possibly due to
extinction from the disk or atmospheric dust/clouds, or that it is an artifact
of the dataset/data processing. Our SCExAO/CHARIS data lower the IR mass limits
for planets inferred at larger stellocentric separations; however, these
ALMA-predicted protoplanet candidates are currently still consistent with
direct imaging constraints.

spacetime foliation, which is defined by a timelike dynamical scalar field, the
khronon. The presence of this preferred foliation makes black hole solutions
more complicated than in General Relativity, with the appearance of multiple
distinct event horizons: a matter horizon for light/matter fields, a spin-0
horizon for the scalar excitations of the khronon, a spin-2 horizon for
tensorial gravitational waves, and even, at least in spherical symmetry, a
universal horizon for instantaneously propagating modes appearing in the
ultraviolet. We study how black hole solutions in Ho\v{r}ava gravity change
when the black hole is allowed to move with low velocity relative to the
preferred foliation. These slowly moving solutions are a crucial ingredient to
compute black hole ""sensitivities"" and predict gravitational wave emission (and
in particular dipolar radiation) from the inspiral of binary black hole
systems. We find that for generic values of the theory's three dimensionless
coupling constants, slowly moving black holes present curvature singularities
at the universal horizon. Singularities at the spin-0 horizon also arise unless
one waives the requirement of asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity.
Nevertheless, we have verified that at least in a one-dimensional subset of the
(three-dimensional) parameter space of the theory's coupling constants, slowly
moving black holes are regular everywhere, even though they coincide with the
general relativistic ones (thus implying in particular the absence of dipolar
gravitational radiation). Remarkably, this subset of the parameter space
essentially coincides with the one selected by the recent constraints from
GW170817 and by solar system tests.

dense, wide-baseline solution that does not demand, and does not suffer from,
feature-based matching. It is able to process a single image with significant
deformation and viewpoint changes, and handles well the core challenges of
occlusions, weak texture and blur. DeepSfT is based on residual encoder-decoder
structures and refining blocks. It is trained end-to-end with a novel
combination of supervised learning from simulated renderings of the object

standard RGB-D camera. The cameras used for fine-tuning and run-time can be
different, making DeepSfT practical for real-world use. We show that DeepSfT

introduced and applied as security components (instead of, e.g., universal hash
functions) in seeded modular wiretap coding schemes, whose second component is
an error-correcting code. These schemes are called modular BRI schemes. An
upper bound on the semantic security information leakage of modular BRI schemes
in a one-shot setting is derived which separates the effects of the biregular
irreducible function on the one hand and the error-correcting code plus the
channel on the other hand. The effect of the biregular irreducible function is
described by the second-largest eigenvalue of an associated stochastic matrix.
A characterization of biregular irreducible functions is given in terms of
connected edge-disjoint biregular graphs. It allows for the construction of new
biregular irreducible functions from families of edge-disjoint Ramanujan
graphs, which are shown to exist. A frequently used arithmetic universal hash
function can be converted into a biregular irreducible function for certain
parameters. Sequences of Ramanujan biregular irreducible functions are
constructed which exhibit an optimal trade-off between the size of the
regularity set and the rate of decrease of the associated second-largest
eigenvalue. Together with the one-shot bound on the information leakage, the
existence of these sequences implies an asymptotic coding result for modular
BRI schemes applied to discrete and Gaussian wiretap channels. It shows that
the separation of error correction and security as done in a modular BRI scheme
is secrecy capacity-achieving for discrete and Gaussian wiretap channels. The
same holds for a derived construction where the seed is generated locally by
the sender and reused several times. Finally, optimal sequences of biregular
irreducible functions used in the above constructions must be nearly Ramanujan.

with sequential observations, in which a network of $n>1$ agents aim to reach a
consensus on the average value of their beliefs, by exchanging information only
with their neighbors. Each agent has sequentially arriving samples of its
belief in an online manner. The neighbor relationships among the $n$ agents are
described by a graph which is possibly time-varying, whose vertices correspond
to agents and whose edges depict neighbor relationships. Two distributed online
algorithms are introduced for undirected and directed graphs, which are both
shown to converge to the average belief almost surely. Moreover, the sequences
generated by both algorithms are shown to reach consensus with an $O(1/t)$ rate
with high probability, where $t$ is the number of iterations. For undirected
graphs, the corresponding algorithm is modified for the case with quantized
communication and limited precision of the division operation. It is shown that
the modified algorithm causes all $n$ agents to either reach a quantized
consensus or enter a small neighborhood around the average of their beliefs.
Numerical simulations are then provided to corroborate the theoretical results.

For this we perform the directional solidification of monodispersed suspensions
in thin samples and we document the thickness h of the dense particle layer
that builds up at the solidification front. We evidence a change of regime in
the evolution of h with the solidification velocity V with, at large velocity,
an inverse proportionality and, at low velocity, a much weaker trend. By
modelling the force balance in the critical state for particle trapping and the
dissipation phenomena in the whole layer, we link the former evolution to
viscous dissipation and the latter evolution to solid friction at the rigid
sample plates. Solid friction is shown to induce an analog of the Janssen
effect on the whole layer. We determine its dependence on the friction
coefficient between particles and plates, on the Janssen's redirection
coefficient in the particle layer, and on the sample depth. Fits of the
resulting relationship to data confirm its relevance at all sample depths and
provide quantitative determinations of the main parameters, especially the
Janssen's characteristic length and the transition thickness h between the
above regimes. Altogether, this study thus clarifies the mechanical implication
of boundaries on freezing suspensions and, on a general viewpoint, provides a

Markov, reciprocal, and so-called $CM_L$ and $CM_F$ (two special classes of CM

evolution of a CM sequence can be described by different models. For example, a
Markov sequence can be described by a Markov model, as well as by reciprocal,
$CM_L$, and $CM_F$ models. Also, sometimes a forward model is available, but it
is desirable to have a backward model for the same sequence (e.g., in
smoothing). Therefore, it is important to study relationships between different
dynamic models of a CM sequence. This paper discusses such relationships
between models of nonsingular Gaussian (NG) $CM_L$, $CM_F$, reciprocal, and
Markov sequences. Two models are said to be explicitly sample-equivalent if not
only they govern the same sequence, but also a one-one correspondence between
their sample paths is made explicitly. A unified approach is presented, such

influential recent developments in computer vision, particularly for
categorization. There is an increasing demand for explainable AI as these
systems are deployed in the real world. However, understanding the information
represented and processed in CNNs remains in most cases challenging. Within
this paper, we explore the use of new information theoretic techniques
developed in the field of neuroscience to enable novel understanding of how a
CNN represents information. We trained a 10-layer ResNet architecture to
identify 2,000 face identities from 26M images generated using a rigorously
controlled 3D face rendering model that produced variations of intrinsic (i.e.
face morphology, gender, age, expression and ethnicity) and extrinsic factors
(i.e. 3D pose, illumination, scale and 2D translation). With our methodology,
we demonstrate that unlike human's network overgeneralizes face identities even
with extreme changes of face shape, but it is more sensitive to changes of
texture. To understand the processing of information underlying these
counterintuitive properties, we visualize the features of shape and texture
that the network processes to identify faces. Then, we shed a light into the
inner workings of the black box and reveal how hidden layers represent these
features and whether the representations are invariant to pose. We hope that
our methodology will provide an additional valuable tool for interpretability
of CNNs.

spring constant, and system-reservoir coupling. The local thermal current can
vanish if the parameters are tuned to proper values. We also consider nonlinear
effect from the system-substrate coupling and find that the local atypical
thermal current survives in the presence of the nonlinear potential. Moreover,
the local atypical thermal current is robust against asymmetry of the

several elongation directions is also drastically affected by the presence of
extended V chains. If the elongation is along the V chains, all compounds
exhibit {practically} the same Poisson ratio in directions perpendicular to it,
further highlighting the importance of the V chains to the mechanical

(corresponding to 250$R_{s}$). We also add complementary multi-wavelength data
from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA; 15 & 43$\,$GHz) and from the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA; 97.5, 233.0, and 343.5$\,$GHz). At
86$\,$GHz, we measure a fractional linear polarization of $\sim2$% in the VLBI
core region. The polarization morphology suggests that the emission is
associated with an underlying limb-brightened jet. The fractional linear
polarization is lower at 43 and 15$\,$GHz ($\sim0.3-0.7$% and $<0.1$%,
respectively). This suggests an increasing linear polarization degree towards
shorter wavelengths on VLBI scales. We also obtain a large rotation measure
(RM) of $\sim10^{5-6}~{\rm rad/m^{2}}$ in the core at $\gtrsim$43$\,$GHz.
Moreover, the VLBA 43$\,$GHz observations show a variable RM in the VLBI core
region during a small flare in 2015. Faraday depolarization and Faraday
conversion in an inhomogeneous and mildly relativistic plasma could explain the
observed linear polarization characteristics and the previously measured
frequency dependence of the circular polarization. Our Faraday depolarization
modeling suggests that the RM most likely originates from an external screen
with a highly uniform RM distribution. To explain the large RM value, the
uniform RM distribution, and the RM variability, we suggest that the Faraday
rotation is caused by a boundary layer in a transversely stratified jet. Based
on the RM and the synchrotron spectrum of the core, we provide an estimate for
the magnetic field strength and the electron density of the jet plasma.

system of tilts is found to be both temperature and Sr-content sensitive with
the biggest tilt magnitudes reached at low temperatures and high $x$. Relative
Nb-O$_6$ displacements, directly responsible for material's ferroelectric
properties, are shown to be distinct in two octahedra sub-systems with
different freezing temperatures and disparate levels of deviation from

directly influence octahedra tilting. These findings establish a new atomistic

general for symmetric operators (i.e. without assuming self-adjointness), and

there is undergoing research for devising them for hypergraphs. Forman-Ricci
curvature is a statistics for graphs, which is based on Riemannian geometry,
and that stresses the relational character of vertices in a network through the
analysis of edges rather than vertices. In spite of the different applications
of this curvature, it has not yet been formulated for hypergraphs. Here we
devise the Forman-Ricci curvature for directed and undirected hypergraphs,
where the curvature for graphs is a particular case. We report its upper and
lower bounds and the respective bounds for the graph case. The curvature
quantifies the trade-off between hyperedge(arc) size and the degree of
participation of hyperedge(arc) vertices in other hyperedges(arcs). We
calculated the curvature for two large networks: Wikipedia vote network and
\emph{Escherichia coli} metabolic network. In the first case the curvature is
ruled by hyperedge size, while in the second by hyperedge degree. We found that
the number of users involved in Wikipedia elections goes hand-in-hand with the
participation of experienced users. The curvature values of the metabolic
network allowed detecting redundant and bottle neck reactions. It is found that
ADP phosphorilation is the metabolic bottle neck reaction but that the reverse
reaction is not that central for the metabolism.

two distinguished half-edges directed toward the vertex. The faces of the new

behind this bijection is to build a path from the distinguished elements, slit
the map along it, and sew back after sliding by one unit, thus mildly modifying
the structure of the map at the extremities of the sliding path. This bijection
provides a sampling algorithm for uniform maps with prescribed face degrees and
allow to recover Tutte's famous counting formula for bipartite and

elementary ones, which each transfer a degree from one face of the map to

field by a non-Hermitian matrix potential which features odd-$PT$ symmetry,
i.e., symmetry with $(PT)^2=-1$. The scattering is characterized by a $4\times
4$ transfer matrix. The main attention is focused on spectral singularities
which are classified into two types. Weak spectral singularities are
characterized by zero determinant of a diagonal $2\times 2$ block of the
transfer matrix. This situation corresponds to the lasing or coherent perfect
absorption of pairs of oppositely polarized modes. Strong spectral
singularities are characterized by zero diagonal block of the transfer matrix.
We show that in odd-$PT$-symmetric systems any spectral singularity is
self-dual, i.e., lasing and coherent perfect absorption occur simultaneously.
Detailed analysis is performed for a case example of a $PT$-symmetric coupler
consisting of two waveguides, one with localized gain and another with
localized absorption, which are coupled by a localized antisymmetric medium.
For this coupler, we discuss weak self-dual spectral singularities and their
splitting into complex-conjugate eigenvalues which represent bound states
characterized by propagation constants with real parts lying in the continuum.
A rather counterintuitive restoration of the unbroken odd-$PT$-symmetric phase
subject to the increase of the gain-and-loss strength is also revealed. The
comparison between odd- and even-$PT-$symmetric couplers, the latter
characterized by $(PT)^2=1$, is also presented.

research from different universities in the UK along with a corresponding set
of news articles. First, we do an exploratory analysis to understand how the
basic information published in the scientific journals get exaggerated as they
are reported in these press releases or news articles. This initial analysis
shows that some news agencies exaggerate almost 60\% of the articles they
publish in the health domain; more than 50\% of the press releases from certain
universities are exaggerated; articles in topics like lifestyle and childhood
are heavily exaggerated. Motivated by the above observation we set the central
objective of this paper to investigate how exaggerated news spreads over an
online social network like Twitter. The LIWC analysis points to a remarkable
observation these late tweets are essentially laden in words from opinion and
realize categories which indicates that, given sufficient time, the wisdom of
the crowd is actually able to tell apart the exaggerated news. As a second step
we study the characteristics of the users who never or rarely post exaggerated
news content and compare them with those who post exaggerated news content more
frequently. We observe that the latter class of users have less retweets or
mentions per tweet, have significantly more number of followers, use more slang
words, less hyperbolic words and less word contractions. We also observe that
the LIWC categories like bio, health, body and negative emotion are more
pronounced in the tweets posted by the users in the latter class. As a final
step we use these observations as features and automatically classify the two
groups achieving an F1 score of 0.83.

propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture termed OrthoSeg for
semantic segmentation using multimodal, orthorectified and coregistered data.
We also propose a training procedure for supervised training of OrthoSeg. The
training procedure complements the inherent architectural characteristics of
OrthoSeg for preventing complex co-adaptations of learned features, which may
arise due to probable high dimensionality and spatial correlation in multimodal
and/or multispectral coregistered data. OrthoSeg consists of parallel encoding
networks for independent encoding of multimodal feature maps and a decoder
designed for efficiently fusing independently encoded multimodal feature maps.
A softmax layer at the end of the network uses the features generated by the
decoder for pixel-wise classification. The decoder fuses feature maps from the
parallel encoders locally as well as contextually at multiple scales to
generate per-pixel feature maps for final pixel-wise classification resulting
in segmented output. We experimentally show the merits of OrthoSeg by
demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on the ISPRS Potsdam 2D Semantic
Segmentation dataset. Adaptability is one of the key motivations behind
OrthoSeg so that it serves as a useful architectural option for a wide range of
problems involving the task of semantic segmentation of coregistered multimodal
and/or multispectral imagery. Hence, OrthoSeg is designed to enable independent
scaling of parallel encoder networks and decoder network to better match
application requirements, such as the number of input channels, the effective
field-of-view, and model capacity.

gravity models introduced in \cite{stelle}-\cite{stelle2}. These are
renormalizable higher order derivative models of gravity, but at cost of
ghostly states propagating in the phase space. A previous work on the subject
is \cite{noakes}. The techniques employed here differ slightly from those in
\cite{noakes}, but the main conclusions agree. Furthermore, the analysis of the
initial value formulation in \cite{noakes} is enlarged and the use of harmonic
coordinates is clarified. In particular, it is shown that the initial
constraints found \cite{noakes} include a redundant one. In other words, this
constraint is satisfied when the equations of motion are taken into account. In
addition, some terms that are not specified in \cite{noakes} are derived
explicitly. This procedure facilitates application of some of the mathematical
theorems given in \cite{ringstrom}. As a consequence of these theorems, the
existence of both $C^\infty$ solutions and maximal globally hyperbolic
developments is proved. The obtained equations may be relevant for the
stability analysis of the solutions under small perturbations of the initial

inspired by H\""ormander-Mikhlin criterion from classical harmonic analysis,
although it is substantially and necessarily different. Locally, we get sharp
growth rates of Lie derivatives around the singularity and nearly optimal
regularity order. The asymptotics also match Mikhlin formula for a
exponentially growing weight with respect to the word length. Additional decay
comes imposed by this growth and Mikhlin condition for high order terms.
Lafforgue/de la Salle's rigidity theorem fits here. The proof includes a new
relation between Fourier and Schur $L_p$-multipliers for nonamenable groups. By
transference, matters are reduced to a rather nontrivial $RC_p$-inequality for
$SL_n(\mathbf{R})$-twisted forms of Riesz transforms associated to fractional
laplacians.
  Our second result gives a new and much stronger rigidity theorem for radial
multipliers in $SL_n(\mathbf{R})$. More precisely, additional regularity and
Mikhlin type conditions are proved to be necessary up to an order $\sim
|\frac12 - \frac1p| (n-1)$ for large enough $n$ in terms of $p$. Locally,
necessary and sufficient growth rates match up to that order. Asymptotically,
extra decay for the symbol and its derivatives imposes more accurate and
additional rigidity in a wider range of $L_p$-spaces. This rigidity increases
with the rank, so we can construct radial generating functions satisfying our
H\""ormander-Mikhlin sufficient conditions in rank $n$ and failing the rigidity
conditions for ranks $m >> n$. We also prove automatic regularity and rigidity

interactions among quarks and gluons, although the total tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$ is
not renormalized thanks to the conservation of energy and momentum. Recently it
has been shown that, through the renormalization, each of the quark and gluon

$T^\mu_\mu= (\beta/2g)F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}+ m (1+\gamma_m)\bar{\psi}\psi$, and
the corresponding formulas have been derived up to two-loop order. We extend
this result to the three-loop order, working out all the relevant three-loop

conspicuous polarization signals in Ca II 854.2 nm, specifically in circular
polarization that often shows multiple lobes mainly due to the shape of Stokes
I. They usually overlap photospheric regions with sheared magnetic field
configuration, suggesting that magnetic reconnections could play an important
role in the origin of PMJs. The discrepancy between their low LOS velocities
and the high apparent speeds reported on earlier, as well as the existence of
different vertical velocity gradients in the chromosphere, indicate that PMJs
might not be entirely related to mass motions. Instead, PMJs could be due to
perturbation fronts induced by magnetic reconnections occurring in the deep
photosphere that propagate through the chromosphere. This reconnection may be
associated with current heating that produces temperature enhancements from the
temperature minimum region. Furthermore, enhanced collisions with electrons
could also increase the coupling to the local conditions at higher layers
during the PMJ phase, giving a possible explanation for the enhanced emission
in the overall Ca II K profiles emerging from these transients.

ionized gas velocity dispersions of $\sim1000$ massive ($\log
M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\gtrsim\,10.3$) galaxies in the Large Early Galaxy
Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey at $0.6\lesssim\,z\lesssim1.0$. The high
$S/N\sim20{\rm\AA^{-1}}$ afforded by 20 hour VLT/VIMOS spectra allows for joint
modeling of the stellar continuum and emission lines in all galaxies, spanning
the full range of galaxy colors and morphologies. These observed integrated
velocity dispersions (denoted as $\sigma'_{g, int}$ and $\sigma'_{\star, int}$)
are related to the intrinsic velocity dispersions of ionized gas or stars, but
also include rotational motions through beam smearing and spectral extraction.
We find good average agreement between observed velocity dispersions, with
$\langle\log(\sigma'_{g, int}/\sigma'_{\star, int})\rangle=-0.003$. This result
does not depend strongly on stellar population, structural properties, or
alignment with respect to the slit. However, in all regimes we find significant
scatter between $\sigma'_{g, int}$ and $\sigma'_{\star, int}$, with an overall
scatter of 0.13 dex of which 0.05 dex is due to observational uncertainties.
For an individual galaxy, the scatter between $\sigma'_{g, int}$ and
$\sigma'_{\star, int}$ translates to an additional uncertainty of
$\sim0.24\rm{dex}$ on dynamical mass derived from $\sigma'_{g, int}$, on top of
measurement errors and uncertainties from Virial constant or size estimates. We
measure the $z\sim0.8$ stellar mass Faber-Jackson relation and demonstrate that
emission line widths can be used to measure scaling relations. However, these
relations will exhibit increased scatter and slopes that are artificially
steepened by selecting on subsets of galaxies with progressively brighter
emission lines.

and legal concerns, ranging from recidivism prediction, to medical diagnosis,
to fighting against fake news. Although machine learning models can sometimes
achieve impressive performance in these tasks, these tasks are not amenable to
full automation. To realize the potential of machine learning for improving
human decisions, it is important to understand how assistance from machine
learning models affects human performance and human agency.
  In this paper, we use deception detection as a testbed and investigate how we
can harness explanations and predictions of machine learning models to improve
human performance while retaining human agency. We propose a spectrum between
full human agency and full automation, and develop varying levels of machine
assistance along the spectrum that gradually increase the influence of machine
predictions. We find that without showing predicted labels, explanations alone
slightly improve human performance in the end task. In comparison, human
performance is greatly improved by showing predicted labels (>20% relative
improvement) and can be further improved by explicitly suggesting strong
machine performance. Interestingly, when predicted labels are shown,
explanations of machine predictions induce a similar level of accuracy as an
explicit statement of strong machine performance. Our results demonstrate a
tradeoff between human performance and human agency and show that explanations
of machine predictions can moderate this tradeoff.

DOG candidate at z ~ 2 by combining the optical and IR photometric data based
on the SDSS and WISE, although its redshift had not yet been confirmed. Based
on the LIRIS observation, we confirmed its redshift of 2.521 and total IR
luminosity of log(L_IR/L_sun) = 14.57, which satisfies the criterion for an
extremely luminous IR galaxy (ELIRG). Moreover, we indicate that this object
seems to have an extremely massive black hole with M_BH = 10^10.92 M_sun based
on the broad Halpha line: the host stellar mass is derived as M_star = 10^13.55
M_sun by a fit of the spectral energy distribution. Very recently, it has been
reported that this object is an anomalous gravitationally lensed quasar based
on near-IR high-resolution imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope. Its magnification factor has also been estimated with some
uncertainty (i.e., mu = 53-122). We investigate the ratio of the black hole to
galaxy mass, which is less strongly affected by a lensing magnification factor,
instead of the absolute values of the luminosities and masses. We find that the
M_BH/M_star ratio (i.e., 0.0140-0.0204) is significantly higher than the local
relation, following a sequence of unobscured quasars instead of obscured
objects (e.g., submillimeter galaxies) at the same redshift. Moreover, the
LIRIS spectrum shows strongly blueshifted oxygen lines with an outflowing
velocity of ~ 1100 km/s, and our Swift X-ray observation also supports that
this source is an absorbed AGN with an intrinsic column density of N_H = 4.9 x

the work of Corasaniti et al. (2017), we predict the reionization history for

ultra-light axion dark matter (ADM) models which reproduce state-of-art
measurements of the galaxy luminosity function at very high-redshifts $6\le

of the limiting UV-magnitude of galaxies contributing to the reionization
$M_{\rm lim}$ and the average effective escape fraction of UV photons reaching
the intergalactic medium $\tilde{f}$. For each DM model we compute the redshift
evolution of the Thomson scattering optical depth $\tau_e(z)$ and the comoving
ionization fraction $Q_{\rm HII}(z)$. We find the different DM models to have
similar reionization histories. Differences with respect to the CDM case
increase at fainter limiting UV-magnitudes and are degenerate with the effect
of varying the reionization model parameters. Using Planck's determination of
the integrated optical depth in combination with measurements of the neutral
hydrogen fraction at different redshifts, we infer constraints on $\tilde{f}$
and $M_{\rm lim}$. The results are largely independent of the assumed DM
scenario, in particular for $M_{\rm lim}\gtrsim -13$ we obtain that the
effective escape fraction lies in the range $0.07\lesssim \tilde{f}\lesssim
0.15$ at $2\sigma$.

provided an ideal laboratory to understand stellar dynamics and primordial star
formation processes. However, during the last two decades, observations
unveiled their real, complex nature. Beside their pristine stars, GCs host one
or more helium enriched and possibly younger stellar populations whose
formation mechanism is still unknown. Even more puzzling is the existence of
GCs showing star by star iron spreads. Using detailed N-body simulations we
explore the hypothesis that these anomalies in metallicity could be the result
of mutual stripping and mergers between a primordial population of disc GCs. In
the first paper of this series we proved, both with analytical arguments and
short-term N-body simulations, that disc GCs have larger fly-by and close
encounter rates with respect to halo clusters. These interactions lead to mass
exchange and even mergers that form new GCs, possibly showing metallicity
spreads. Here, by means of long-term direct N-body simulations, we provide
predictions on the dynamical properties of GCs that underwent these processes.
The comparison of our predictions with available and future observational data

between active and inactive galaxies at metallicities below $0.5\ Z_\odot$. To
robustly classify the ionizing radiation of such metal-poor galaxies, which

vertical velocity distribution and stellar number density distribution. This
was done for eight separate data samples, with different cuts in observed
absolute magnitude, each containing about 25,000 stars. The model for the total
matter density does not rely on any underlying baryonic model, although we
assumed that it is symmetrical, smooth, and monotonically decreasing with
distance from the mid-plane. We infer a density distribution which is strongly
peaked in the region close to the Galactic plane ($\lesssim 60$ pc), for all

constant density, this corresponds to a surplus surface density of

to muon spallation of argon, which produces unstable isotopes that later beta
decay. We present the first comprehensive study of MeV spallation backgrounds

We show that above a nominal detection threshold of 5-MeV electron energy, the

distribution function (PDF) for the spherically-averaged matter density field.
The PDF is represented as a path integral and is evaluated using the
saddle-point method. It factorizes into an exponent given by a spherically
symmetric saddle-point solution and a prefactor produced by fluctuations. The
exponent encodes the leading sensitivity of the PDF to the dynamics of
gravitational clustering and statistics of the initial conditions. In contrast,
the prefactor has only a weak dependence on cosmology. It splits into a
monopole contribution which is evaluated exactly, and a factor corresponding to
aspherical fluctuations. The latter is crucial for the consistency of the
calculation: neglecting it would make the PDF incompatible with translational
invariance. We compute the aspherical prefactor using a combination of analytic
and numerical techniques. We demonstrate the factorization of spurious enhanced
contributions of large bulk flows and their cancellation due the equivalence
principle. We also identify the sensitivity to the short-scale physics and
argue that it must be properly renormalized. The uncertainty associated with
the renormalization procedure gives an estimate of the theoretical error. For
zero redshift, the precision varies from sub percent for moderate density
contrasts to tens of percent at the tails of the distribution. It improves at
higher redshifts. We compare our results with N-body simulation data and find

used to probe the dynamics of ground-state ion motions in many laboratory
plasmas. However, these measurements place restrictions on the metastable ion
lifetime. Metastable states are produced from direct ionization of neutral
atoms as well as ions in other electronic states, of which the former will only
faithfully represent processes that act on the ion dynamics in a time shorter
than the metastable lifetime. We present here the first experimental study of
this type of systematic effect using wave-particle interaction in an argon
multidipole plasma. The metastable lifetime and relative fraction of
metastables produced from preexisting ions, necessary for correcting the LIF
measurement errors, can be determined by fitting the experimental results with
the theory we propose.

is around three to four orders of magnitude smaller that its primordial mass
inferred from disk models. Yet dynamical studies have shown that the asteroid
belt could not have been depleted by more than about an order of magnitude over
the past ~4 Gyr. The remainder of the mass loss must have taken place during an
earlier phase of the solar system's evolution. An orbital instability in the
outer solar system occurring during the process of terrestrial planet formation
can reproduce the broad characteristics of the inner solar system. Here, we
test the viability of this model within the constraints of the main belt's low
present-day mass and orbital structure. While previous studies modeled
asteroids as massless test particles because of limited computing power, our
work uses GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) acceleration to model a fully
self-gravitating asteroid belt. We find that depletion in the main belt is
related to the giant planets' exact evolution within the orbital instability.
Simulations that produce the closest matches to the giant planets' current
orbits deplete the main belt by two to three orders of magnitude. These
simulated asteroid belts are also good matches to the actual asteroid belt in
terms of their radial mixing and broad orbital structure.

to be composed of remnant cores produced by photoevaporation. Based on the

ensemble. Two dynamical regimes emerge according to the value of the anisotropy

always recovered whenever the flux is brought back to zero. On the contrary,
for $|\Delta| < 1$, instabilities of quasiparticles produce irreversible
dynamics as confirmed by the dramatic growth of entanglement entropy. In this
regime, the standard GHD description becomes incomplete and we complement it
via a maximum entropy production principle. We test our predictions against

conserved to machine precision. This implies that the asymptotic equilibrium
corresponds to the velocity of the center of mass. Aimed at studying dust
dynamics, we implement this numerical method in the publicly available code
FARGO3D. To validate our implementation, we develop a test suite for an
arbitrary number of species, based on analytical or exact solutions of problems
related to perfect damping, damped sound waves, shocks, local and global
gas-dust radial drift in a disk and, linear streaming instability. In
particular, we obtain first-order, steady-state solutions for the radial drift
of multiple dust species in protoplanetary disks, in which the pressure
gradient is not necessarily small. We additionally present non-linear
shearing-box simulations of the streaming instability and compare them with
previous results obtained with Lagrangian particles. We successfully validate
our implementation by recovering the solutions from the test suite to second-
and first-order accuracy in space and time, respectively. From this, we
conclude that our scheme is suitable, and very robust, to study the
self-consistent dynamics of several fluids. In particular, it can be used for
solving the collisions between gas and dust in protoplanetary disks, with any
degree of coupling.

arise from shocks and turbulence; hence, radio observations can be useful for
determining the merger state of a cluster. In preparation for a larger study,
we selected three clusters -- Abell 1319, Abell 1314, and RXC J1501.3+4220
(Z7215) -- making use of the new LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 120-168
MHz, and together with archival data, show that these clusters appear to be in
pre-merging, merging, and post-merging states, respectively. We argue that
Abell 1319 is likely in its pre-merging phase, where three separate cluster
components are about to merge. There are no radio halos nor radio relics
detected in this system. Abell 1314 is a highly-disturbed, low-mass cluster
which is likely in the process of merging. This low-mass system does not show a
radio halo, however, we argue that the merger activates mechanisms that cause
electron re-acceleration in the large 800 kpc radio tail associated with
IC~711. In the cluster Z7215 we discover diffuse radio emission at the cluster
center, and we classify this emission as a radio halo, although it is dimmer
and smaller than expected by the radio halo power versus cluster mass
correlation. We suggest that the disturbed cluster Z7215 is in its post-merging
phase. Systematic studies of this kind over a larger sample of clusters
observed with LoTSS will help constrain the time scales involved in turbulent
re-acceleration and the subsequent energy losses of the underlying electrons.

emission associated with the intra-cluster medium (ICM). These synchrotron
sources are generally classified as radio haloes and radio relics. Whilst it is
commonly accepted that mergers play a crucial role in the formation of radio
haloes and relics, not all the merging clusters show the presence of giant
diffuse radio sources and this provides important information concerning
current models. The Abell 781 complex is a spectacular system composed of an
apparent chain of clusters on the sky. Its main component is undergoing a
merger and hosts peripheral emission that is classified as a candidate radio
relic and a disputed radio halo. We used new LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR)
observations at 143 MHz and archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)
observations at 325 and 610 MHz to study radio emission from non-thermal
components in the ICM of Abell 781. Complementary information came from
XMM-Newton data, which allowed us to investigate the connection with the
thermal emission and its complex morphology. The origin of the peripheral
emission is still uncertain. We speculate that it is related to the interaction
between a head tail radio galaxy and shock. However, the current data allow us
only to set an upper limit of $\mathcal{M} < 1.4$ on the Mach number of this
putative shock. Instead, we successfully characterise the surface brightness
and temperature jumps of a shock and two cold fronts in the main cluster
component of Abell 781. Their positions suggest that the merger is involving
three substructures. We do not find any evidence for a radio halo either at the
centre of this system or in the other clusters of the chain. We place an upper
limit to the diffuse radio emission in the main cluster of Abell 781 that is a
factor of 2 below the current radio power-mass relation for giant radio haloes.

we match with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 and DR12 quasar
catalogues. We find that BALQSOs are twice as likely to be detected at
144$\,$MHz than their non-BAL counterparts, and BALQSOs with low-ionisation
species present in their spectra are three times more likely to be detected
than those with only high-ionisation species. The BALQSO fraction at 144$\,$MHz
is constant with increasing radio luminosity, which is inconsistent with
previous results at 1.4$\,$GHz, indicating that observations at the different
frequencies may be tracing different sources of radio emission. We cross-match
radio sources between the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters
(FIRST) survey and LDR1, which provides a bridge via the LDR1 Pan-STARRS
counterparts to identify BALQSOs in SDSS. Consequently we expand the sample of
BALQSOs detected in FIRST by a factor of three. The LDR1-detected BALQSOs in
our sample are almost exclusively radio-quiet (\logr $\,<2$), with radio sizes
at 144$\,$MHz typically less than $200\,$kpc; these radio sizes tend to be
larger than those at 1.4$\,$GHz, suggesting more extended radio emission at low
frequencies. We find that although the radio detection fraction increases with
increasing balnicity index (BI), there is no correlation between BI and either
low-frequency radio power or radio-loudness. This suggests that both radio
emission and BI may be linked to the same underlying process, but are spatially
distinct phenomena.

continuum emission, there is still a debate as to whether star formation or
active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity dominate the radio continuum luminosity.
To date, radio emission in quasars has been investigated almost exclusively
using high-frequency observations in which the Doppler boosting might have an
important effect on the measured radio luminosity, whereas extended structures,
best observed at low radio frequencies, are not affected by the Doppler
enhancement. We used a sample of quasars selected by their optical spectra in
conjunction with sensitive and high-resolution low-frequency radio data
provided by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) as part of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky
Survey (LoTSS) to investigate their radio properties using the radio loudness
parameter ($\mathcal{R} = \frac{L_{\mathrm{144-MHz}}}{L_{\mathrm{i\,band}}}$).
The examination of the radio continuum emission and RL/RQ dichotomy in quasars
exhibits that quasars show a wide continuum of radio properties (i.e. no clear
bimodality in the distribution of $\mathcal{R}$). Radio continuum emission at
low frequencies in low-luminosity quasars is consistent with being dominated by
star formation. We see a significant albeit weak dependency of $\mathcal{R}$ on
the source nuclear parameters. For the first time, we are able to resolve radio
morphologies of a considerable number of quasars. All these crucial results
highlight the impact of the deep and high-resolution low-frequency radio
surveys that foreshadow the compelling science cases for the Square Kilometre

pervades the large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. Measuring the IGMF is
important to determine its origin (i.e. primordial or otherwise). Using data
from the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), we present the Faraday rotation
measure (RM) and depolarisation properties of the giant radio galaxy
J1235+5317, at a redshift of $z = 0.34$ and 3.38 Mpc in size. We find a mean RM
difference between the lobes of $2.5\pm0.1$ rad/m$^2$ , in addition to small
scale RM variations of ~0.1 rad/m$^2$ . From a catalogue of LSS filaments based
on optical spectroscopic observations in the local universe, we find an excess
of filaments intersecting the line of sight to only one of the lobes.
Associating the entire RM difference to these LSS filaments leads to a gas
density-weighted IGMF strength of ~0.3 {\mu}G. However, direct comparison with
cosmological simulations of the RM contribution from LSS filaments gives a low
probability (~5%) for an RM contribution as large as 2.5 rad/m$^2$ , for the
case of IGMF strengths of 10 to 50 nG. It is likely that variations in the RM
from the Milky Way (on 11' scales) contribute significantly to the mean RM
difference, and a denser RM grid is required to better constrain this
contribution. In general, this work demonstrates the potential of the LOFAR
telescope to probe the weak signature of the IGMF. Future studies, with
thousands of sources with high accuracy RMs from LoTSS, will enable more
stringent constraints on the nature of the IGMF.

strongest emission lines in velocity bins. We associated the core of the lines
with the disc, consistent with the stellar velocity, and the redshifted and the
blueshifted wings with the outflow. We find that the outflowing gas is
characterised by higher values of density and ionisation parameter than the
disc, which presents a higher dust extinction. Moreover, we distinguish high-
and low-ionisation regions across the portion of spatially resolved narrow-line
region traced by the outflowing gas. The high-ionisation regions characterised
by the lowest [NII]/H{\alpha} and [SII]/H{\alpha} line ratios generally trace
the innermost parts along the axis of the emitting cones where the [SIII]/[SII]
line ratio is enhanced, while the low-ionisation regions follow the cone edges
and/or the regions perpendicular to the axis of the outflows, also
characterised by a higher [OIII] velocity dispersion. A possible scenario to
explain these features relies on the presence of two distinct populations of
line emitting clouds: one is optically thin to the radiation and is
characterised by the highest excitation, while the other is optically thick and
is impinged by a filtered, and thus harder, radiation field which generates
strong low-excitation lines. The highest values of [NII]/H{\alpha} and
[SII]/H{\alpha} line ratios may be due to shocks and/or a hard filtered
radiation field from the AGN.

their ability to reproduce and predict accurately the energy, structural, and

discovery of new superionic conductors is convenient to establish meaningful
relations between ionic transport and simple materials descriptors. Recently,
several experimental studies on lithium fast-ion conductors have suggested a
correlation between lattice softness and enhanced ionic conductivity due to a
concomitant decrease in the activation energy for ion migration, $E_{a}$. In
this article, we employ extensive \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics
simulations based on density functional theory to substantiate the links
between ionic transport and lattice dynamics in a number of structurally and
chemically distinct lithium superionic conductors. Our first-principles results
show no evidence for a direct and general correlation between $E_{a}$, or the
hopping attempt frequency, and lattice softness. However, we find that, in
agreement with recent observations, the pre-exponential factor of lithium
diffusivity, $D_{0}$, follows the Meyer-Neldel rule $\propto
\exp{\left(E_{a}/\langle \omega \rangle\right)}$, where $\langle \omega
\rangle$ represents an average phonon frequency. Hence, lattice softness can be
identified with enhanced lithium diffusivity but only within families of
superionic materials presenting very similar migration activation energies, due
to larger $D_{0}$. On the technical side, we show that neglection of
temperature effects in first-principles estimation of $E_{a}$ may lead to huge
inaccuracies of $\sim 10$\%. The limitations of zero-temperature harmonic
approaches in modeling of lithium-ion conductors are also illustrated.

parameters near the non-interacting Fermion limit where the charge operator
dominantly couples to soliton-antisoliton pairs of the sine-Gordon model, we
find that the local dynamical resistance shows an array of sharp peaks in
frequency representing coherent phase oscillations on top of an incoherent
background. The strength of the coherent peaks relative to the incoherent
background increases as a powerlaw in frequency as well as exponentially as the
Luttinger parameter approaches a critical value. The dynamical conductivity
also clearly shows the insulating gap. We then compare the results in the high

observed with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 120-168 MHz. Centred at a
J2000 declination of $-4.5^{\circ}$, this is a challenging field to observe
with LOFAR because of its low elevation with respect to the array. The low
elevation of this field reduces the effective collecting area of the telescope,
thereby reducing sensitivity. This low elevation also causes the primary beam
to be elongated in the north-south direction, which can introduce side lobes in
the synthesised beam in this direction. However the XMM-LSS field is a key
field to study because of the wealth of ancillary information, encompassing
most of the electromagnetic spectrum. The field was observed for a total of 12
hours from three four-hour LOFAR tracks using the Dutch array. The final image
presented encompasses $\sim 27$ deg$^2$, which is the region of the
observations with a $>$50\% primary beam response. Once combined, the

remains challenging, the combination of spectroscopic and photometric

RLAGN. We used the sample, combined with recently developed analytical models,
to investigate the lifetime distribution of RLAGN. We show that large or giant
powerful RLAGN are probably the old tail of the general RLAGN population, but
that the low-luminosity RLAGN candidates in our sample, many of which have
sizes $<100$ kpc, either require a very different lifetime distribution or have
different jet physics from the more powerful objects. We then used analytical
models to develop a method of estimating jet kinetic powers for our candidate
objects and constructed a jet kinetic luminosity function based on these
estimates. These values can be compared to observational quantities, such as
the integrated radiative luminosity of groups and clusters, and to the
predictions from models of RLAGN feedback in galaxy formation and evolution. In
particular, we show that RLAGN in the local Universe are able to supply all the
energy required per comoving unit volume to counterbalance X-ray radiative
losses from groups and clusters and thus prevent the hot gas from cooling. Our
computation of the kinetic luminosity density of local RLAGN is in good
agreement with other recent observational estimates and with models of galaxy
formation.

observations from the XMM-Newton and Chandra telescopes. X-ray data show two
prominent features: (i) a long (~600 kpc in projection) and bent tail of cool
gas trailing (towards south-west) the optical center of NGC 4839, and ii) a
""sheath"" region of enhanced X-ray surface brightness enveloping the group,
which is due to hotter gas. While at first glance the X-ray images suggest that
we are witnessing the first infall of NGC 4839 into the Coma cluster core, we
argue that a post-merger scenario provides a better explanation of the observed
features and illustrate this with a series of numerical simulations. In this
scenario, the tail is formed when the group, initially moving to the
south-west, reverses its radial velocity after crossing the apocenter, the ram
pressure ceases and the ram-pressure-displaced gas falls back toward the center
of the group and overshoots it. Shortly after the apocenter passage, the
optical galaxy, dark matter and gaseous core move in a north-east direction,
while the displaced gas continues moving to the south-west. The ""sheath"" is
explained as being due to interaction of the re-infalling group with its own
tail of stripped gas mixed with the Coma gas. In this scenario, the shock,
driven by the group before reaching the apocenter, has already detached from
the group and would be located close to the famous relic to the south-west of
the Coma cluster.

non-centrosymmetric superconductor with the unique out-of-plane or Ising
spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we report the observation of an unusual
continuous paramagnetic-limited superconductor-normal metal transition in 2D
NbSe$_2$. Using tunneling spectroscopy under high in-plane magnetic fields, we
observe a continuous closing of the superconducting gap at the upper critical
field at low temperatures, in stark contrast to the abrupt first-order

continuous transition arises from a large spin susceptibility of the
superconducting phase due to the Ising SOC. The result is further supported by
self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the ab initio band structure

radio-galaxy evolution and environmental impact, for understanding AGN
triggering and life cycles, and for calibrating galaxy feedback in cosmological
models. We use the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 1 catalogues
to investigate this relationship. We cross-matched 8,745 radio-loud AGN with
0.08<z<0.4, selected from LoTSS, with two Sloan Digital Sky Survey cluster
catalogues, and find that only 10 percent of LoTSS AGN in this redshift range
have an association, so that the majority of low-redshift AGN (including a
substantial fraction of the most radio-luminous objects) must inhabit haloes
with M < 10^14 M_sun. We find that the probability of a cluster association,
and the richness of the associated cluster, is correlated with AGN radio
luminosity, and for the cluster population, the number of associated AGN and
the radio luminosity of the brightest associated AGN is richness-dependent. We
demonstrate that these relations are not driven solely by host-galaxy stellar
mass, supporting models in which large-scale environment is influential in
driving AGN jet activity. At the lowest radio luminosities we find that the
minority of objects with a cluster association are located at larger mean
cluster-centre distances than more luminous AGN, which appears to be driven
primarily by host-galaxy mass. Finally, we also find that FRI radio galaxies
inhabit systematically richer environments than FRIIs. The work presented here
demonstrates the potential of LoTSS for AGN environmental studies. In future,
the full northern-sky LoTSS catalogue, together with the use of deeper
optical/IR imaging data and spectroscopic follow-up with WEAVE-LOFAR, will
provide opportunities to extend this type of work to much larger samples and
higher redshifts.

parameter space in terms of depth and resolution. The data taken with these
interferometers, for example with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), are often
calibrated in a low signal-to-noise ratio regime and the removal of critical
systematic effects is challenging. The process requires an understanding of
their origin and properties.
  Aim: In this paper we describe the major systematic effects inherent to next
generation low-frequency telescopes, such as LOFAR. With this knowledge, we
introduce a data processing pipeline that is able to isolate and correct these
systematic effects. The pipeline will be used to calibrate calibrator
observations as the first step of a full data reduction process.
  Methods: We processed two LOFAR observations of the calibrator 3C196: the
first using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system at 42-66 MHz and the second using
the High Band Antenna (HBA) system at 115-189 MHz.
  Results: We were able to isolate and correct for the effects of clock drift,
polarisation misalignment, ionospheric delay, Faraday rotation, ionospheric
scintillation, beam shape, and bandpass. The designed calibration strategy
produced the deepest image to date at 54 MHz. The image has been used to
confirm that the spectral energy distribution of the average radio source
population tends to flatten at low frequencies.
  Conclusions: We prove that LOFAR systematic effects can be described by a
relatively small number of parameters. Furthermore, the identification of these
parameters is fundamental to reducing the degrees of freedom when the
calibration is carried out on fields that are not dominated by a strong
calibrator.

  Next, we confine these abstract results to positive semigroups on Banach
lattices with a quasi-interior point. In that situation, the said criteria are
intimately linked to so-called AM-compact operators (which entail kernel
operators and compact operators); and they imply that the original semigroup
asymptotically embeds into a compact group of positive invertible operators on
an atomic Banach lattice. By means of a structure theorem for such group
representations (reminiscent of the Peter--Weyl theorem and its consequences

factor of $\sim$2.2 larger than predicted from the surrounding band data and
fits. This excess appears due to diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line
region (BLR). The precise mixing of disk and BLR components cannot be

with mass or luminosity. We also find that there are systematic differences

study blazars in the low-frequency regime with unprecedented sensitivity and

within the LDR1 footprint. Only the 3FGL unidentified $\gamma$-ray sources
(UGS) could not be firmly associated with an LDR1 source; this was due to
source confusion. We examined the redshift and radio luminosity distributions
of our sample, finding flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) to be more distant
and more luminous than BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) on average. Blazars are
known to have flat spectra in the gigahertz regime but we found this to extend
down to $144$ MHz, where the radio spectral index, $\alpha$, of our sample is
$-0.17 \pm 0.14$. For BL Lacs, $\alpha = -0.13 \pm 0.16$ and for FSRQs, $\alpha
= -0.15 \pm 0.17$. We also investigated the radio-to-$\gamma$-ray connection
for the $30$ $\gamma$-ray-detected sources in our sample. We find Pearson's
correlation coefficient is $0.45$ ($p = 0.069$). This tentative correlation and
the flatness of the spectral index suggest that the beamed core emission
contributes to the low-frequency flux density. We compare our sample
distribution with that of the full LDR1 on colour-colour diagrams, and we use
this information to identify possible radio counterparts to two of the four UGS
within the LDR1 field. We will refine our results as LoTSS continues.

construction, the resulting spatio-temporal modes are coherent in space and
over a pre-defined finite time horizon and optimally capture the variance, or
energy of the ensemble. For the example of intermittent acoustic radiation from
a turbulent jet, we introduce a conditional expectation operator that focuses
on the loudest events, as measured by a pressure probe in the far-field and
contained in the tail of the pressure signal's probability distribution.
Applied to high-fidelity simulation data, the method identifies a statistically
significant `prototype', or average acoustic burst event that is tracked over
time. Most notably, the burst event can be traced back to its precursor, which
opens up the possibility of prediction of an imminent burst. We furthermore
investigate the mechanism underlying the prototypical burst event using linear
stability theory and find that its structure and evolution is accurately
predicted by optimal transient growth theory. The jet-noise problem
demonstrates that the conditional space-time POD formulation applies even for
systems with probability distributions that are not heavy-tailed, i.e. for
systems in which events overlap and occur in rapid succession.

rates (SFRs) unaffected by extinction due to dust, of which the low-frequency
part is uncontaminated from thermal (free-free) emission. We calibrate the
conversion from the spatially resolved 140 MHz RC emission to the SFR surface
density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) at 1 kpc scale. We used recent observations of
three galaxies (NGC 3184, 4736, and 5055) from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey
(LoTSS), and archival LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) data of NGC 5194. Maps were
created with the facet calibration technique and converted to radio
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ maps using the Condon relation. We compared these maps with
hybrid $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ maps from a combination of GALEX far-ultraviolet and
Spitzer 24 $\mu\rm m$ data using plots tracing the relation at $1.2\times
1.2$-kpc$^2$ resolution. The RC emission is smoothed with respect to the hybrid
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ owing to the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs). This
results in a sublinear relation $(\Sigma_{\rm SFR})_{\rm RC} \propto
[(\Sigma_{\rm SFR})_{\rm hyb}]^{a}$, where $a=0.59\pm 0.13$ (140 MHz) and
$a=0.75\pm 0.10$ (1365 MHz). Both relations have a scatter of $\sigma = 0.3~\rm
dex$. If we restrict ourselves to areas of young CREs ($\alpha > -0.65$; $I_\nu
\propto \nu^\alpha$), the relation becomes almost linear at both frequencies
with $a\approx 0.9$ and a reduced scatter of $\sigma = 0.2~\rm dex$. We then
simulate the effect of CRE transport by convolving the hybrid $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ maps with a Gaussian kernel until the RC-SFR relation is linearised; CRE
transport lengths are $l=1$-5 kpc. Solving the CRE diffusion equation, we find
diffusion coefficients of $D=(0.13$-$1.5) \times 10^{28} \rm cm^2\,s^{-1}$ at 1
GeV. A RC-SFR relation at $1.4$ GHz can be exploited to measure SFRs at
redshift $z \approx 10$ using $140$ MHz observations.

computer vision allow us to overcome this difficulty by explicitly modeling the

of an observed image is performed via Bayesian inference of the posterior
distribution. This conceptually simple approach tends to fail in practice
because of several difficulties stemming from sampling the posterior
distribution: high-dimensionality and multi-modality of the posterior
distribution as well as expensive simulation of the rendering process. The main
difficulty of sampling approaches in a computer vision context is choosing the
proposal distribution accurately so that maxima of the posterior are explored
early and the algorithm quickly converges to a valid image interpretation. In
this work, we propose to use a Bayesian Neural Network for estimating an image
dependent proposal distribution. Compared to a standard Gaussian random walk
proposal, this accelerates the sampler in finding regions of the posterior with
high value. In this way, we can significantly reduce the number of samples

ShapeSearch queries, and design a natural-language and regex-based parser to
automatically parse and translate user queries to the algebra representation.
To execute these queries within interactive response times, ShapeSearch uses a
fast shape algebra-based execution engine with query-aware optimizations, and
perceptually-aware scoring methodologies. We present a thorough evaluation of
the system, including a general-purpose user study, a case study involving
genomic data analysis, as well as performance experiments, comparing against
state-of-the-art time series shape matching approaches---that together
demonstrate the usability and scalability of ShapeSearch.

average magnetic field magnitude (B-) profile of a ""typical"" magnetic cloud

that was used to modify a time shifted Bessel function (force-free) magnetic
field, where shifted refers to a field that was adjusted for typical MC
self-similar expansion. This was developed in the context of the Lepping,
Jones, and Burlaga (J. Geophys. Res. vol. 95, p.11957, 1990) [called LJB here]

representations of the MC's B-profile in most cases. In the LBW article,
through testing, it was shown that on average it can be expected that in about
80% of the MC cases (but it varies according to the spacecrafts' actual closest
approach distances) the modified model's B-profile of the MC should be
significantly improved by use of this scheme. We describe how this scheme can
be employed practically in modifying the LJB MC fitting model, and we test a
new and slightly better (and less unwieldy) version of the scheme, the
non-shifted (of Bessel functions) version, which is the one actually used in
the LJB model modification. The new scheme is based on modification formulae
that are slightly more accurate than the old scheme, and it is expected to
improve the B-profile in approximately 83% of the cases on average. The schemes
are applicable for use with data originating only at/near 1 AU, since the
magnetic field and plasma data used in the development of the associated
formulae were from only the Wind spacecraft, which was and is at 1 AU.

flux and recently found evidence for neutrino emission from the blazar TXS
0506+056. These results open a new window into the high-energy universe.
However, the source or sources of most of the observed flux of astrophysical
neutrinos remains uncertain. Here, a search for steady point-like neutrino
sources is performed using an unbinned likelihood analysis. The method searches
for a spatial accumulation of muon-neutrino events using the very
high-statistics sample of about $497\,000$ neutrinos recorded by IceCube
between 2009 and 2017. The median angular resolution is $\sim1^\circ$ at 1 TeV
and improves to $\sim0.3^\circ$ for neutrinos with an energy of 1 PeV. Compared
to previous analyses, this search is optimized for point-like neutrino emission
with the same flux-characteristics as the observed astrophysical muon-neutrino
flux and introduces an improved event-reconstruction and parametrization of the
background. The result is an improvement in sensitivity to the muon-neutrino
flux compared to the previous analysis of $\sim35\%$ assuming an $E^{-2}$
spectrum. The sensitivity on the muon-neutrino flux is at a level of $E^2
\mathrm{d} N /\mathrm{d} E = 3\cdot
10^{-13}\,\mathrm{TeV}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. No new evidence for
neutrino sources is found in a full sky scan and in an a priori candidate
source list that is motivated by gamma-ray observations. Furthermore, no
significant excesses above background are found from populations of
sub-threshold sources. The implications of the non-observation for potential
source classes are discussed.

proximity. Ages have been derived for few of them showing differences up to few
million years, hinting at being binary star clusters. However, final
confirmation needs to be done through spectroscopic analysis. Here we focus on
the LMC cluster pair NGC2006-SL538 and aim to determine whether the star
cluster pair is a bound entity (binary star cluster) or a chance alignment.
Using the MIKE echelle spectrograph at LCO we have acquired integrated-light
spectra for each cluster. We have measured radial velocities by two methods: a)
direct line profile measurement yields v$_r=300.3\pm5\pm6$ km/s for NGC2006 and
$v_r=310.2\pm4\pm6$ km/s for SL538. b) By comparing observed spectra with
synthetic bootstrapped spectra yielding $v_r=311.0\pm0.6$ km/s for NGC2006 and
$v_r=309.4\pm0.5$ km/s for SL538. Finally when spectra are directly compared,
we find a ${\Delta}v=1.08\pm0.47$ km/s. Full-spectrum SED fits reveal that the
stellar population ages lie in the range 13-21 Myr with a metallicity of
Z=0.008. We find indications for differences in the chemical abundance patterns
as revealed by the helium absorption lines between the two clusters. The
dynamical analysis shows that the two clusters are likely to merge within the
next $\sim$150 Myr. The NGC2006-SL538 cluster pair shows radial velocities,
stellar population and dynamical parameters consistent with a gravitational
bound entity. We conclude that this is a genuine binary cluster pair, and we
propose that their differences in ages and stellar population chemistry is most
likely due to variances in their chemical enrichment history within their
environment. We suggest that their formation may have taken place in a loosely
bound star-formation complex which saw initial fragmentation but then had its
clusters become a gravitationally bound pair by tidal capture.

dynamics combine Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi edge-addition with a Poisson rain of
lightning strikes. All edges in a connected component are deleted when any of
its vertices is struck by lightning. We consider the asymptotic regime of
lightning rates for which the model displays self-organized criticality. The
age of a vertex increases at unit rate, but it is reset to zero at each burning
time. We show that the empirical age distribution converges as a process to a
deterministic solution of an autonomous measure-valued differential equation.
The main technique is to observe that, conditioned on the vertex ages, the
graph is an inhomogeneous random graph in the sense of Bollob\'as, Janson and
Riordan. We then study the evolution of the ages via the multitype
Galton--Watson trees that arise as the limit in law of the component of an
identified vertex at any fixed time. These trees are critical from the gelation
time onwards.

attacks, where the devices are restricted to have no memory, we employ two
different techniques that exploit this restriction to further reduce the number

Bell tests with distant setups and situate these parameters in the security
analysis. Moreover, focusing on one of the experimental platforms, namely
nitrogen-vacancy based systems, we describe experimental improvements that can

pronounced for low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, and the probability of

wavelengths to estimate dust-only emission corrected for free-free emission
contamination. From these observations we identify 32 molecular clumps in the
LMC and estimate their total mass from their dust emission to range from 205 to
5740 M$_{\odot}$. We derive a cumulative clump mass function ($N(\geq M)
\propto M^{\alpha + 1}$) and fit it with a double power law to find
$\alpha_{\mathrm{low}} = -1.76^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, $\alpha_{\mathrm{high}} = -3.3
\pm 0.2$, and a break mass of 2500$^{+300}_{-200}$ M$_{\odot}$. A comparison to
the 30 Doradus-10 mass function derived previously from CO (2-1) data reveals a
consistent range of clump masses and good agreement between the fitted slopes.
We also find that the low mass index of the LMC mass function agrees well with
the high mass index for core and clump mass functions from several star forming
regions in the Milky Way. This agreement may indicate an extension of the Milky
Way power law to higher masses than previously observed.

compact manifold $M$, and $K$ be a compact Lie group endowed with an $\mathrm
{ad}$-invariant inner product on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{k}$. A connection
$A$ on a principal $K$-bundle $p:P\to M$ on $M$ is locally homogeneous if for
any two points $x_1$, $x_2\in M$ there exists an isometry $\varphi:U_1\to U_2$
between open neighborhoods $U_i\ni x_i$ which sends $x_1$ to $x_2$ and admits a
$\varphi$-covering bundle isomorphism preserving the connection $A$. This
condition is invariant under the action of the automorphism group (gauge group)
of the bundle, so the classification problem for LH connections leads to an
interesting moduli problem: for fixed objects $(M,g,K)$ as above describe
geometrically the moduli space of all LH connections on principal $K$-bundles
on $M$ (up to bundle isomorphisms). Note that if $A$ is LH, then the associated
connection metric $g_A$ on $P$ is locally homogenous, so it defines a geometric
structure (in the sense of Thurston) on the total space of the bundle.
Therefore this moduli problem is related to the classification of LH
(geometric) Riemannian manifolds which admit a Riemannian submersion onto the
given manifold $M$.
  Omitting the details, our moduli problem concerns the classification of
geometric fibre bundles over a given geometric base. We develop a general
method for describing moduli spaces of LH connections on a given base. Using
our method we give explicit descriptions of these moduli spaces when the base
manifold is a hyperbolic Riemann surface $(M,g)$ and $K\in\{S^1,PU(2)\}$. The
case $K=S^1$ leads to a new construction of the moduli spaces of Yang-Mills
$S^1$-connections on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces, and the case $K=PU(2)$ leads
to a one-parameter family of compact, 5-dimensional geometric manifolds, which
we study in detail.

For values of HA below a kd-dependent maximum value, the xy helix phase
transitions with increasing Hx into a spin-flop (SF) phase where the ordered

be distributed on either one or two xyz spherical ellipses. The minor axes of
the ellipses are oriented along the z axis and the major axes along the y axis
where the ellipses are flattened along the z axis due to the presence of the XY
anisotropy. From energy minimization of the SF spherical ellipse parameters for
given values of kd, HA and Hx, four kd-dependent SF phases are found: either
one or two xyz spherical ellipses and either one or two xy fans, in addition to
the xy helix phase and the paramagnetic (PM) phase with all moments aligned
along Hx. The PM phase occurs via second-order transitions from the xy fan and
SF phases with increasing Hx. Phase diagrams in the Hx-HA plane are constructed

opens new scenarios for dark matter, in connection with the presence of black

for black holes to decay into white holes via a tunnelling. This process yields
to an explosion and possibly to a long remnant phase, that cures the
information paradox. Primordial black holes undergoing this evolution
constitute a peculiar kind of decaying dark matter, whose lifetime depends on
their mass $M$ and can be as short as $M^2$. As smaller black holes explode
earlier, the resulting signal have a peculiar fluence-distance relation. I
discuss the different emission channels that can be expected from the explosion
(sub-millimetre, radio, TeV) and their detection challenges. In particular, one
of these channels produces an observed wavelength that scales with the redshift
following a unique flattened wavelength-distance function, leaving a signature

rigorous bounds on the circuit size depend on the number of terms $L$ in the

$\Lambda$. Consequently, Trotter-Suzuki is only practical for sparse
Hamiltonians. Trotter-Suzuki is a deterministic compiler but it was recently

exquisite performance having been achieved down to the single photon level.
Further improvements in photodetectors would open new possibilities across a
broad range of scientific disciplines, and enable new types of applications.
However, it is still unclear what is possible in terms of ultimate performance,
and what properties are needed for a photodetector to achieve such performance.
Here, we present a general modeling framework for photodetectors whereby the
photon field, the absorption process, and the amplification process are all
treated as one coupled quantum system. The formalism naturally handles field
states with single or multiple photons as well as a variety of detector
configurations, and includes a mathematical definition of ideal photodetector
performance. The framework reveals how specific photodetector architectures
introduce limitations and tradeoffs for various performance metrics, providing
guidance for optimization and design.

propose RAE, an unsupervised framework that learns role embeddings. It combines
a within-node loss function and a graph neural network (GNN) architecture to
place nodes with similar local neighborhoods close in embedding space. We also
propose a faster way of generating negative examples called neighbor shuffling,
which quickly creates negative examples directly within batches. These
techniques can be easily combined with existing GNN methods to create
unsupervised role embeddings at scale. We then explore role action embeddings,
which summarize the non-structural features in a node's neighborhood, leading
to better performance on node classification tasks. We find that the model

conversion and storage which is attracting renewed attention. In this concept,
a material absorbs sunlight and stores the energy chemically via an induced
structural change, which can later be reversed to release the energy as heat.
An example is the azobenzene molecule which has a cis-trans photoisomerization
with these properties, and can be tuned by chemical substitution and attachment
to templates such as carbon nanotubes, small molecules, or polymers. By analogy
to the Shockley-Queisser limit for photovoltaics, we analyze the maximum
attainable efficiency for STFs from fundamental thermodynamic considerations.
Microscopic reversibility provides a bound on the quantum yield of
photoisomerization due to fluorescence, regardless of details of
photochemistry. We emphasize the importance of analyzing the free energy, not
just enthalpy, of the metastable molecules, and find an efficiency limit for
conversion to stored chemical energy equal to the Shockley-Queisser limit. STF
candidates from a recent high-throughput search are analyzed in light of the
efficiency limit.

object. An example is an airliner flying from an origin to a destination. Such
problems have three main components: an origin, a destination, and motion in
between. To emphasize that the motion trajectories end up at the destination,
we call them \textit{destination-directed trajectories}. The Markov sequence is
not flexible enough to model such trajectories. Given an initial density and an
evolution law, the future of a Markov sequence is determined probabilistically.
One class of conditionally Markov (CM) sequences, called the $CM_L$ sequence
(including the Markov sequence as a special case), has the following main
components: a joint endpoint density (i.e., an initial density and a final
density conditioned on the initial) and a Markov-like evolution law. This paper
proposes using the $CM_L$ sequence for modeling destination-directed
trajectories. It is demonstrated how the $CM_L$ sequence enjoys several
desirable properties for destination-directed trajectory modeling. Some
simulations of trajectory modeling and prediction are presented for

criteria that exploits the probabilistic nature of the GPR to use uncertainty
estimates of all images in combination with the force of the transition state
in the analytic potential. Our method is an order of magnitude faster in terms

stochastically excite Internal Gravity Waves (IGWs), which effectively
transport angular momentum throughout the stellar interior and explain the
observed near-uniform interior rotation rates of intermediate-mass stars.
However, there are few detections of IGWs, and fewer still made using
photometry, with more detections needed to constrain numerical simulations.
Aims. We aim to formalise the detection and characterisation of IGWs in
photometric observations of stars born with convective cores (M > 1.5
M$_{\odot}$) and parameterise the low-frequency power excess caused by IGWs.
Methods. Using the most recent CoRoT light curves for a sample of O, B, A and F
stars, we parameterise the morphology of the flux contribution of IGWs in
Fourier space using an MCMC numerical scheme within a Bayesian framework. We
compare this to predictions from IGW numerical simulations and investigate how
the observed morphology changes as a function of stellar parameters. Results.
We demonstrate that a common morphology for the low-frequency power excess is
observed in early-type stars observed by CoRoT. Our study shows that a
background frequency-dependent source of astrophysical signal is common, which
we interpret as IGWs. We provide constraints on the amplitudes of IGWs and the
shape of their detected frequency spectrum across a range of mass, which is the
first ensemble study of stochastic variability in such a diverse sample of
stars. Conclusions. The evidence of a low-frequency power excess across a wide
mass range supports the interpretation of IGWs in photometry of O, B, A and F
stars. We also discuss the prospects of observing hundreds of massive stars
with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in the near future.

boundary Euler equations with a submerged point vortex. We prove that
sufficiently small-amplitude waves with small enough vortex strength are
conditionally orbitally stable. In the process of obtaining this result, we
develop a quite general stability/instability theory for bound state solutions
of a large class of infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems in the presence of
symmetry. This is in the spirit of the seminal work of Grillakis, Shatah, and
Strauss, but with hypotheses that are relaxed in a number of ways necessary for
the point vortex system, and for other hydrodynamical applications more
broadly. In particular, we are able to allow the Poisson map to have merely
dense range, as opposed to being surjective, and to be state-dependent.
  As a second application of the general theory, we consider a family of
nonlinear dispersive PDEs that includes the generalized KdV and Benjamin--Ono
equations. The stability/instability of solitary waves for these systems has
been studied extensively, notably by Bona, Souganidis, and Strauss, who used a
modification of the GSS method. We provide a new, more direct proof of these
results that follows as a straightforward consequence of our abstract theory.
At the same time, we extend them to fractional order dispersive equations.

deep-learning-based robust nonlinear controller (Neural Lander) that improves
control performance of a quadrotor during landing. Our approach combines a
nominal dynamics model with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that learns high-order
interactions. We apply spectral normalization (SN) to constrain the Lipschitz
constant of the DNN. Leveraging this Lipschitz property, we design a nonlinear
feedback linearization controller using the learned model and prove system
stability with disturbance rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first DNN-based nonlinear feedback controller with stability guarantees that
can utilize arbitrarily large neural nets. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed controller significantly outperforms a Baseline Nonlinear
Tracking Controller in both landing and cross-table trajectory tracking cases.
We also empirically show that the DNN generalizes well to unseen data outside
the training domain.

$\Sigma^{+}\eta$ and $\Sigma^+\eta^\prime$, using an $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation
data sample of 567 pb$^{-1}$ taken at a center-of-mass energy of 4.6 GeV with

statistical significance of $2.5\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$, respectively.
Normalizing to the reference decays $\Lambda_c^+\to\Sigma^+\pi^0$ and

($<0.68\%$) and $\mathcal

($<1.9\%$). Here, the first uncertainties are statistical and the second

can be explained by a linear mixing between elementary states and composite

predicting heavy first- and second-generation sfermions (${\gtrsim 100}$ TeV)

configurations has caught the intrigue of the medical community. While these
devices provide a highly affordable support tool for the caregivers for
continuous monitoring and to detect acute conditions, such as arrhythmia, their
utility for cardiac diagnostics remains limited. This is because clinical
diagnosis of many cardiac pathologies is rooted in gleaning patterns from
synchronous 12-lead ECG. If synchronous 12-lead signals of clinical quality can
be synthesized from these single-lead devices, it can transform cardiac care by
substantially reducing the costs and enhancing access to cardiac diagnostics.
However, prior attempts to synthesize synchronous 12-lead ECG have not been
successful. Vectorcardiography (VCG) analysis suggests that cardiac axis
synthesized from earlier attempts deviates significantly from that estimated
from 12-lead and/or Frank lead measurements. This work is perhaps the first
successful attempt to synthesize clinically equivalent synchronous 12-lead ECG
from single-lead ECG. Our method employs a random forest machine learning model
that uses a subject's historical 12-lead recordings to estimate the morphology
including the actual timing of various ECG events (relative to the measured
single-lead ECG) for all 11 missing leads of the subject. Our method was
validated on two benchmark datasets as well as paper ECG and AliveCor-Kardia
data obtained from the Heart, Artery, and Vein Center of Fresno, California.
Results suggest that this approach can synthesize synchronous ECG with
accuracies (R2) exceeding 90%. Accurate synthesis of 12-lead ECG from a
single-lead device can ultimately enable its wider application and improved
point-of-care (POC) diagnostics.

construct a formal mirror family to a pair $(S,D)$ where $S$ is a smooth
rational projective surface and $D$ a certain type of Weil divisor supporting
an ample or anti-ample class. In that paper they proved two convergence
results. Firstly that if the intersection matrix of $D$ is not negative
semi-definite then the family they construct lifts to an algebraic family.
Secondly they prove that if the intersection matrix is negative definite then
their construction lifts along certain analytic strata on the base, and then
over a formal neighbourhood of this. In the original version of that paper they
claimed that if the intersection matrix were negative semi-definite then family
in fact extends over an analytic neighbourhood of the origin but gave an
incorrect proof.
  In this paper we correct this error. We explain how the general Gross-Siebert
program can be used to reduce construction of the mirror to such a surface to
calculating certain relative Gromov-Witten invariants. We then relate these
invariants to the invariants of a new space where we can find explicit formulae
for the invariants. From this we deduce analytic convergence of the mirror
family, at least when the original surface has an $I_4$ fibre.

capability of a trained model, in terms of the number of classes recognizable
by the model. The key problem in this task is the requirement of storing data
(e.g. images) associated with existing classes, while teaching the classifier
to learn new classes. However, this is impractical as it increases the memory
requirement at every incremental step, which makes it impossible to implement
IL algorithms on edge devices with limited memory. Hence, we propose a novel
approach, called `Learning without Memorizing (LwM)', to preserve the
information about existing (base) classes, without storing any of their data,
while making the classifier progressively learn the new classes. In LwM, we
present an information preserving penalty: Attention Distillation Loss
($L_{AD}$), and demonstrate that penalizing the changes in classifiers'
attention maps helps to retain information of the base classes, as new classes
are added. We show that adding $L_{AD}$ to the distillation loss which is an
existing information preserving loss consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art performance in the iILSVRC-small and iCIFAR-100 datasets in
terms of the overall accuracy of base and incrementally learned classes.

scalable Bayesian sampling framework that unifies stochastic gradient MCMC

Wasserstein gradient flows. With a rigorous non-asymptotic convergence theory
developed recently, SPOS avoids the particle-collapsing pitfall of SVGD.
Nevertheless, variance reduction in SPOS has never been studied. In this paper,
we bridge the gap by presenting several variance-reduction techniques for SPOS.
Specifically, we propose three variants of variance-reduced SPOS, called SAGA
particle-optimization sampling (SAGA-POS), SVRG particle-optimization sampling
(SVRG-POS) and a variant of SVRG-POS which avoids full gradient computations,
denoted as SVRG-POS$^+$. Importantly, we provide non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees for these algorithms in terms of 2-Wasserstein metric and analyze
their complexities. Remarkably, the results show our algorithms yield better
convergence rates than existing variance-reduced variants of stochastic
Langevin dynamics, even though more space is required to store the particles in

the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the
inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the

MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to
characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps.
Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed
to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based
Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture
the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the
inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is
used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature
matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensive
empirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant dataset
demonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.

conductances have an heavy tail at $0$, parametrized by some $p>1$, where $1/p$
is the exponent of the tail. We prove a phase transition recurrence/transience
with respect to $p$ and identify the critical parameter to be equal to the

correlations inherent in quantum states that cannot be accessed by classical
measurements. For multipartite states, the classically accessible correlations
can be defined by the mutual information of the multipartite measurement
outcomes. In general the quantum discord of an arbitrary quantum state involves
an optimisation of over the classical measurements which is hard to compute. In
this paper, we examine the quantum discord in the experimentally relevant case
when the quantum states are Gaussian and the measurements are restricted to
Gaussian measurements. We perform the optimisation over the measurements to
find the Gaussian discord of the bipartite EPR state and tripartite GHZ state
in the presence of different types of noise: uncorrelated noise, multiplicative
noise and correlated noise. We find that by adding uncorrelated noise and
multiplicative noise, the quantum discord always decreases. However, correlated
noise can either increase or decrease the quantum discord. We also find that
for low noise, the optimal classical measurements are single quadrature
measurements. As the noise increases, a dual quadrature measurement becomes
optimal.

  Sequence-to-Sequence Autoencoder",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Representation learning of pedestrian trajectories transforms variable-length
timestamp-coordinate tuples of a trajectory into a fixed-length vector
representation that summarizes spatiotemporal characteristics. It is a crucial
technique to connect feature-based data mining with trajectory data. Trajectory
representation is a challenging problem, because both environmental constraints
(e.g., wall partitions) and temporal user dynamics should be meticulously
considered and accounted for. Furthermore, traditional sequence-to-sequence
autoencoders using maximum log-likelihood often require dataset covering all
the possible spatiotemporal characteristics to perform well. This is infeasible
or impractical in reality. We propose TREP, a practical pedestrian trajectory
representation learning algorithm which captures the environmental constraints
and the pedestrian dynamics without the need of any training dataset. By
formulating a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder with a spatial-aware objective
function under the paradigm of actor-critic reinforcement learning, TREP
intelligently encodes spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories with the
capability of handling diverse trajectory patterns. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real datasets validate the high fidelity of TREP to
represent trajectories.

optimal robustness of a class of flow networks against a \textit{targeted}
attack, namely max-load targeted attack, that triggers cascading failures due
to removal of largest load carrying portion of lines. The setup involves a
network of $N$ lines with initial loads $L_1, \ldots, L_N$, drawn from
independent and identical uniform distribution, and free-spaces or redundancies
$S_1, \ldots, S_N$ to be allocated. In the failure propagation mechanism, a
line fails initially due to attack and later due to overloading. The load that
was carried at the moment of failing gets redistributed equally among all
remaining lines in the system. We analyze robustness of this network against
the max-load targeted attack that removes the largest load carrying
$p$-fraction of the lines from the system. The system designer allocates $S_i$
as a stochastic function of the load in each line. Assuming an average
available resource budget, we show that allocating all lines the free-spaces
equally among nodes is optimal under some regulatory assumptions. We provide
numerical results verifying that equal free-space allocation to all lines
perform optimally in more general targeted attack scenarios.

micron (IRAC channel 2). We did not detect the object and place an upper limit
on the flux of 0.3 uJy (3sigma). This implies an effective spherical diameter
less than [98, 140, 440] meters and albedo greater than [0.2, 0.1, 0.01] under
the assumption of low, middle, or high thermal beaming parameter eta,
respectively. With an aspect ratio for `Oumuamua of 6:1, these results
correspond to dimensions of [240:40, 341:57, 1080:180] meters, respectively. We
place upper limits on the amount of dust, CO, and CO2 coming from this object
that are lower than previous results; we are unable to constrain the production
of other gas species. Both our size and outgassing limits are important because
`Oumuamua's trajectory shows non-gravitational accelerations that are sensitive
to size and mass and presumably caused by gas emission. We suggest that
`Oumuamua may have experienced low-level post-perihelion volatile emission that
produced a fresh, bright, icy mantle. This model is consistent with the
expected eta value and implied high albedo value for this solution, but, given
our strict limits on CO and CO2, requires another gas species --- probably H2O
--- to explain the observed non-gravitational acceleration. Our results extend
the mystery of `Oumuamua's origin and evolution.

merely recognizing individual object instances is insufficient. Instead, the
interactions between object instances need to be captured in order to
facilitate reasoning and understanding of the visual scenes in an image. Scene

existing techniques on scene graph generation fail to distinguish subjects and

wave Telescope), a new GW detector with two 3-km baseline arms arranged in the
shape of an ""L"", located inside the Mt. Ikenoyama, Kamioka, Gifu, Japan.
KAGRA's design is similar to those of the second generations such as Advanced
LIGO/Virgo, but it will be operating at the cryogenic temperature with sapphire
mirrors. This low temperature feature is advantageous for improving the
sensitivity around 100 Hz and is considered as an important feature for the
third generation GW detector concept (e.g. Einstein Telescope of Europe or
Cosmic Explorer of USA). Hence, KAGRA is often called as a 2.5 generation GW
detector based on laser interferometry. The installation and commissioning of
KAGRA is underway and its cryogenic systems have been successfully tested in
May, 2018. KAGRA's first observation run is scheduled in late 2019, aiming to
join the third observation run (O3) of the advanced LIGO/Virgo network. In this
work, we describe a brief history of KAGRA and highlights of main feature. We
also discuss the prospects of GW observation with KAGRA in the era of O3. When
operating along with the existing GW detectors, KAGRA will be helpful to locate
a GW source more accurately and to determine the source parameters with higher
precision, providing information for follow-up observations of a GW trigger
candidate.

To study this, we set up a scaling analysis of the 3D MHD equations, driven by

scales as $k^{-2}$ in the inertial range, where $k$ is a wavevector belonging
to the inertial range, and also speculate on unequal scaling by the kinetic and

many queries are required to find $l$-collisions for random functions of which

for a random function by recursively calling the algorithm for finding

of the emitting regions, such as temperature and density. These properties make
RRLs, potentially, a powerful tool of extragalactic ISM physics. At low radio
frequencies, its conceivable to detect RRLs out to cosmological distances when
illuminated by a strong radio continuum. However, they are extremely faint (tau
~ 1e-3 -- 1e-4) and have so far eluded detection outside of the local universe.
  With LOFAR observations of the radio quasar 3C 190 (z=1.1946), we aim to
demonstrate that the ISM can be explored out to great distances through
low-frequency RRLs.
  We report the detection of RRLs in the frequency range 112--163 MHz in the
spectrum of 3C 190. Stacking 13 a-transitions with principal quantum numbers
n=266-301, a peak 6sigma feature of optical depth, tau(peak) = (1.0 +\- 0.2) x
1e-3 and FWHM = 31.2 +/- 8.3 km/s was found at z=1.124. This corresponds to a
velocity offset of -9965 km/s with respect to the systemic redshift of 3C 190.
  We consider three interpretations of the origin of the RRL emission: an
intervening dwarf-like galaxy, an AGN-driven outflow, and the inter-galactic
medium. We argue that the RRLs most likely originate in a dwarf-like galaxy (M
~ 1e9 Msun) along the line of sight, although we cannot rule out an AGN-driven
outflow. We do find the RRLs to be inconsistent with an inter-galactic medium
origin. With this detection, we have opened up a new way to study the physical
properties of cool, diffuse gas out to cosmological distances.

diffuse with a diffusion coefficient that is inversely proportional to the
photon number. The same process occurs in lasers which limits its intrinsic
linewidth and makes the phase uncertainty difficult to calculate. The most
commonly used simplification is to assume a narrow photon-number distribution
for the optical field (which we call the small-noise approximation). For
coherent light, this condition is determined by the average photon number. The
small-noise approximation relies on (i) the input to have a good
signal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) that such a signal-to-noise ratio can be
maintained throughout the amplification process. Here we ask: For a coherent
input, how many photons must be present in the input to a quantum linear
amplifier for the phase noise at the output to be amenable to a small-noise
analysis? We address these questions by showing how the phase uncertainty can
be obtained without recourse to the small-noise approximation. It is shown that
for an ideal linear amplifier (i.e. an amplifier most favourable to the
small-noise approximation), the small-noise approximation breaks down with only
a few photons on average. Interestingly, when the input strength is increased
to tens of photons, the small-noise approximation can be seen to perform much
better and the process of phase diffusion permits a small-noise analysis. This
demarcates the limit of the small-noise assumption in linear amplifiers as such
an assumption is less true for a nonideal amplifier.

observing traffic characteristics in a specific NFV scenario. So, most of them
use a uniform threshold to scale in/out. In real NFV scenario, each VNF may
serve the one or more flows, and the characteristics of these flows are
completely different, a uniform threshold used in this scenario is not
suitable, because each VNF has a distinct processing logic depending on
incident network traffic and events. Even if certain VNFs share packet
processing functionality such as packet header analysis, the differences in
upper-layer processing and implementation can exhibit unique resource usage
patterns.
  We proposes a dynamic threshold scaling mechanism that can tailor thresholds
according to each VNF's characteristic. As setting thresholds is a per-VNF
task, and requires a deep understanding of workload trends and the diversity of
each VNF, so we have added tailor-made features to the traditional dynamic
mechanism. Besides, we also reserve resources by predicting workload and add an
emergency module to cope with anomaly traffic, that is to say we develop a
hybrid scaling policy combining proactive and reactive scaling together.
Moreover, the sharp rise of network traffic not only can be caused by large
amount of new incoming flows, but also can be induced by the growing of
existing flows. If the traffic arises mainly due to the growing of existing
flows, then only rerouting new flows can not alleviate the overload quickly and
SLAs may be violated \cite{zhang2016co}. The only method to avoid SLA
violations is to migrate flows and associated NF internal states quickly and
safely from existing instances to new scaled instances, so state migration is
an important part of the scaling procedure. We achieved the flow migration in
scaling process on openNF to guarantee the accuracy and timeline of scaling.

learning of main patterns from samples with noisy labels is an important
challenge. Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks tend to
prioritize the learning of simple patterns over the memorization of noise
patterns. This suggests a possible method to search for the best generalization
that learns the main pattern until the noise begins to be memorized.
Traditional approaches often employ a clean validation set to find the best
stop timing of learning, i.e., early stopping. However, the generalization
performance of such methods relies on the quality of validation sets. Further,
in practice, a clean validation set is sometimes difficult to obtain. To solve
this problem, we propose a method that can estimate the optimal stopping timing
without a clean validation set, called limited gradient descent. We modified
the labels of a few samples in a noisy dataset to obtain false labels and to
create a reverse pattern. By monitoring the learning progress of the noisy and
reverse samples, we can determine the stop timing of learning. In this paper,
we also theoretically provide some necessary conditions on learning with noisy
labels. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate
that our approach has a comparable generalization performance to methods
relying on a clean validation set. Thus, on the noisy Clothing-1M dataset, our

lies in a very compact lifted mixed-integer formulation for approximating the

characterize the union of finite number of simple convex sets, which naturally
relax the square function in a piecewise manner with properly placed knots. We
implement (with JuMP) a simple adaptive refinement algorithm. Numerical
experiments on synthetic instances used in the literature show that our
prototypical implementation (with hundreds of lines of Julia code) can already
close a significant portion of gap left by various state-of-the-art global

where it's utilized to train the generator to provide real-looking outputs. In
this paper we propose a novel method that makes an explicit use of the

  The approach we propose does not alter the conventional training stage. At
test-time, however, it transfers the output from the generator into the
discriminator, and uses feedback modules (convolutional blocks) to translate
the features of the discriminator layers into corrections to the features of
the generator layers, which are used eventually to get a better generator
result. Our method can contribute to both conditional and unconditional GANs.

(referred to as HAR) is a growing area of research in ubiquitous computing.
Most recent research in the field adopts supervised deep learning paradigms to
automate extraction of intrinsic features from raw signal inputs and addresses
HAR as a multi-class classification problem where detecting a single activity
class within the duration of a sensory data segment suffices. However, due to
the innate diversity of human activities and their corresponding duration, no
data segment is guaranteed to contain sensor recordings of a single activity
type. In this paper, we express HAR more naturally as a set prediction problem
where the predictions are sets of ongoing activity elements with unfixed and
unknown cardinality. For the first time, we address this problem by presenting
a novel HAR approach that learns to output activity sets using deep neural
networks. Moreover, motivated by the limited availability of annotated HAR
datasets as well as the unfortunate immaturity of existing unsupervised
systems, we complement our supervised set learning scheme with a prior
unsupervised feature learning process that adopts convolutional auto-encoders
to exploit unlabeled data. The empirical experiments on two widely adopted HAR
datasets demonstrate the substantial improvement of our proposed methodology

constriction. In the frequency domain, we analyze the width of the locking
range, the increase in intensity and reduction in linewidth as a function of
the applied direct current. Then we show that the injection locking of the

stroboscopic technique that relies on a phase stable excitation, in this case
given by the synchronisation to the microwave current. Field sweeps at

attribute this anomaly to the structural disorder, some other authors claim
that the short-range order, leading to washed-out Van Hove singularities, would
cause the boson-peak anomaly. As in our model system, the disorder-induced and
shortrange--order-induced features can be completely separated, we are able to
discuss the controversy about the boson peak in real glasses in a new light.
Our findings suggest that the interpretation of the boson peak in terms of
short-range order only, might result from a coincidence of the two phenomena in
the materials studied. In general, as we show, the two phenomena both exist,
but are two completely separate entities.

largest scales where the number of modes is low. Whilst more accurate
distributions have previously been developed in idealized cases, we derive a
procedure suitable for analysing measured monopole power spectra with window
effects, stochastic shot noise, and the dependence of the covariance matrix on

proposed to give an approximately Gaussian likelihood, with a
variance--correlation decomposition of the covariance matrix to account for its
cosmological dependence. By comparing with the modified-$t$ likelihood derived
under the usual normality assumption, we find in numerical tests that our new
procedure gives more accurate constraints on the local non-Gaussianity
parameter $f_\mathrm{NL}$, which is sensitive to the large-scale power. A
simple data analysis pipeline is provided for straightforward application of
this new approach in preparation for forthcoming large galaxy surveys such as

core challenges of modern physics. A range of methods has been developed to
approach this task, each with its own idiosyncrasies, approximations, and realm
of applicability. Perhaps the most successful and ubiquitous of these
approaches is density functional theory (DFT). Its Kohn-Sham formulation has
been the basis for many fundamental physical insights, and it has been
successfully applied to fields as diverse as quantum chemistry, condensed
matter and dense plasmas. Despite the progress made by DFT and related schemes,
however, there remain many problems that are intractable for existing methods.
In particular, many approaches face a huge computational barrier when modeling
large numbers of coupled electrons and ions at finite temperature. Here, we
address this shortfall with a new approach to modeling many-body quantum
systems. Based on the Bohmian trajectories formalism, our new method treats the
full particle dynamics with a considerable increase in computational speed. As

sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts
and can provide additional information for other automatic image analysis
algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using
learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth
annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper
we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of
acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused
confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general
shadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level
annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations.
A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow
segmentation to a reference confidence map. Additionally, a confidence
estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and
the reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow
confidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation
metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation and etc. to verify the
effectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human
annotation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow
segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. We
further demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow
confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view
image fusion and automated biometric measurements.

segment decompositions are exposed in. Inspired by Persistent Homology, groups
of shape commonality are revealed. Experiments show that extracted persistent
commonality groups can feature semantically meaningful shape concepts; the
generalization of the proposed approach is evaluated by different real-world
datasets. We extend this by not only learning shape concepts using real-world
data, but by also using mental simulation of artificial abstract objects for
training purposes. This extended approach is unsupervised in two respects:
label-agnostic (no label information is used) and instance-agnostic (no
instances preselected by human supervision are used for training). Experiments
show that concepts generated with mental simulation, generalize and
discriminate real object observations. Consequently, a robot may train and
learn its own internal representation of concepts regarding shape appearance in
a self-driven and machine-centric manner while omitting the tedious process of
supervised dataset generation including the ambiguity in instance labeling and

autoregressive models in which the structural parameters are identified via

tested. A set of parametric restrictions is derived under which the structural
matrix is globally or partially identified and a Savage-Dickey density ratio is
used to assess the validity of the identification conditions. The latter is
facilitated by analytical derivations that make the computations fast and
numerical standard errors small. As an empirical example, monetary models are
compared using heteroskedasticity as an additional device for identification.
The empirical results support models with money in the interest rate reaction

recognize a sketched object, most existing methods discard such important

sketches into binary images for classification. In this paper, we propose a
novel single-branch attentive network architecture RNN-Rasterization-CNN
(Sketch-R2CNN for short) to fully leverage the dynamics in sketches for
recognition. Sketch-R2CNN takes as input only a vector sketch with grouped
sequences of points, and uses an RNN for stroke attention estimation in the
vector space and a CNN for 2D feature extraction in the pixel space
respectively. To bridge the gap between these two spaces in neural networks, we
propose a neural line rasterization module to convert the vector sketch along
with the attention estimated by RNN into a bitmap image, which is subsequently
consumed by CNN. The neural line rasterization module is designed in a
differentiable way to yield a unified pipeline for end-to-end learning. We
perform experiments on existing large-scale sketch recognition benchmarks and
show that by exploiting the sketch dynamics with the attention mechanism, our
method is more robust and achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art
methods.

semimetallic phases characterized by the presence of topologically protected
band degeneracies. In Weyl semimetals, the foundational gapless topological
phase, chiral degeneracies are isolated near the Fermi level and give rise to
the Fermi-arc surface states. However, it is now recognized that chiral
degeneracies are ubiquitous in the band structures of systems with broken
spatial inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) or time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry.
This leads to a broadly defined notion of topological metals, which implies the
presence of disconnected Fermi surface sheets characterized by non-zero Chern
numbers inherited from the enclosed chiral degeneracies. Here, we address the
possibility of experimentally observing surface-related signatures of chiral
degeneracies in metals. As a representative system we choose bcc iron, a
well-studied archetypal ferromagnetic metal with two nontrivial electron
pockets. We find that the (110) surface presents arc-like resonances attached
to the topologically nontrivial electron pockets. These Fermi-arc resonances
are due to two different chiral degeneracies, a type-I elementary Weyl point
and a type-II composite (Chern numbers $\pm 2$) Weyl point, located at slightly
different energies close to the Fermi level. We further show that these surface
resonances can be controlled by changing the orientation of magnetization,
eventually being eliminated following a topological phase transition. Our study
thus shows that the intricate Fermi-arc features can be observed in materials
as simple as ferromagnetic iron, and are possibly very common in polar and
magnetic materials broadly speaking. Our study also provides methodological
guidelines to identifying Fermi-arc surface states and resonances, establishing
their topological origin and designing control protocols.

challenging task, with the performance of leading systems not yet achieving
even 10\% of that of LiDAR-based counterparts. One explanation for this
performance gap is that existing systems are entirely at the mercy of the
perspective image-based representation, in which the appearance and scale of
objects varies drastically with depth and meaningful distances are difficult to
infer. In this work we argue that the ability to reason about the world in 3D
is an essential element of the 3D object detection task. To this end, we
introduce the orthographic feature transform, which enables us to escape the
image domain by mapping image-based features into an orthographic 3D space.
This allows us to reason holistically about the spatial configuration of the
scene in a domain where scale is consistent and distances between objects are
meaningful. We apply this transformation as part of an end-to-end deep learning
architecture and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 3D object
benchmark.\footnote{We will release full source code and pretrained models upon

introducing angular and amplitude parameters of the stretching of substrate in
the simulation. At the mean time, we significantly restrain red shift in the
absorption spectra by applying flipped-configuration and substrate etching
configuration to ADB structure. Intriguing quadratic functions between
stretching ratio and the absorption peak wavelength are obtained when
stretching in x and y direction. For other directions, EIT lineshape appears in
transmission spectra. These results might contribute to future application of

time-varying network structure and an efficient route is allocated to each user
in the network. The network topology is designed by considering addition,
removal, and rewiring of links. At each time instants, a new node connects with
an existing node based on the degree and correlation with its neighbor. Traffic
congestion is handled by rewiring of some congested links along with the
removal of the anti-preferential and correlated links. Centrality plays an
important role to find the most important node in the network. The more a node
is central, the more it can be used for the shortest route of the user pairs
and it can be congested due to a large number of data coming from its
neighborhood. Therefore, routes of the users are selected such that the sum of
the centrality of the nodes appearing in the user's route is minimum.
Thereafter, we analyze the network structure by using various network
properties such as the clustering coefficient, centrality, average shortest
path, rich club coefficient, average packet travel time and order parameter.

the equivalence at all orders in perturbation theory between these classical

the latter is unitary), thus extending previous works that were able to deal

the life-cycle of some of the most powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei
(RLAGN). These galaxies display large-scale remnant radio plasma in the
intergalactic medium left behind by a past episode of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) activity, and meanwhile, the radio jets have restarted in a new episode.
The knowledge of what causes the jets to switch off and restart is crucial to
our understanding of galaxy evolution, while it is important to know if DDRGs
form a host galaxy dichotomy relative to RLAGN. We utilised the LOFAR Two-Metre
Sky Survey DR1, using a visual identification method to compile a sample of
morphologically selected candidate DDRGs, showing two pairs of radio lobes. To
confirm the restarted nature in each of the candidate sources, we obtained
follow-up observations with the VLA at higher resolution to observe the inner
lobes or restarted jets, the confirmation of which created a robust sample of
33 DDRGs. We created a comparison sample of 777 RLAGN from the DR1 catalogue,
and compared the optical and infrared magnitudes and colours of their host
galaxies. We find that there is no statistically significant difference in the
brightness of the host galaxies between double-doubles and single-cycle RLAGN.
The DDRG and RLAGN samples also have similar distributions in WISE mid-infrared
colours, indicating similar ages of stellar populations and dust levels in the
hosts of DDRGs. We conclude that DDRGs and 'normal' RLAGN are hosted by
galaxies of the same type, and that DDRG activity is simply a normal part of
the life cycle of RLAGN. Restarted jets, particularly for the class of
low-excitation radio galaxies, rather than being a product of a particular
event in the life of a host galaxy, must instead be caused by smaller scale
changes, such as in the accretion system surrounding the black hole.

in the canonical form of the electronic master equation. For a driven molecular
system described in a bipartite Hilbert space H=Hel x Hvib of dimension 2 x Nv,
we derive the canonical form of the electronic master equation, deducing the
canonical measures of non-Markovianity and the Bloch volume of accessible
states. We find that one of the decoherence rates is always negative,
accounting for the inherent non-Markovian character of the electronic evolution
in the vibrational environment. Enhanced non-Markovian behavior, characterized
by two negative decoherence rates, appears if there is a coupling between the
electronic states g, e, such that the evolution of the electronic populations
obeys d(PgPe)/dt > 0. Non-Markovianity of the electronic evolution is analyzed
in relation to temporal behaviors of the electronic-vibrational entanglement
and electronic coherence, showing that enhanced non-Markovian behavior
accompanies entanglement increase. Taking as an example the coupling of two
electronic states by a laser pulse in the Cs2 molecule, we analyze
non-Markovian dynamics under laser pulses of various strengths, finding that
the weaker pulse stimulates the bigger amount of non-Markovianity. We show that
increase of the electronic-vibrational entanglement over a time interval is
correlated to the growth of the total amount of non-Markovianity calculated
over the same interval using canonical measures and connected with the increase
of the Bloch volume. After the pulse, non-Markovian behavior is correlated to
electronic coherence, such that vibrational motion in the electronic potentials
which diminishes the nuclear overlap, implicitly increasing the linear entropy
of entanglement, brings a memory character to dynamics.

abundant unlabeled samples to facilitate the classification task by retaining
the original distribution of the data. In S3RMLSC, a hierarchical guided filter
(HGF) is initially used to smoothen the pixels of the HSI data to preserve the
spatial pixel consistency. This step is followed by the construction of linear
patches from the nonlinear manifold by using the maximal linear patch (MLP)
criterion. Then the inter-patch and intra-patch dissimilarity matrices are
constructed in both spectral and spatial domains by regularized manifold local

dynamical population structure that self-organizes itself to better project the
input space into a map. The niched fitness concept is defined along with its
dynamical population structure, both are indispensable for the understanding of
the proposed method. Promising results are shown on two continuous multi-step
problems. One of which is yet more challenging than previous problems of this

in the spin qubit is operationally well defined through the Stern-Gerlach
set-up in the non-relativistic (i.e., low velocity) limit. However, an
operational definition of the spin in the relativistic regime is missing. The
origin of this difficulty lies in the fact that, on the one hand, the spin gets
entangled with the momentum in Lorentz-boosted reference frames, and on the
other hand, for a particle moving in a superposition of velocities, it is
impossible to ""jump"" to its rest frame, where spin is unambiguously defined.
Here, we find a quantum reference frame transformation corresponding to a
""superposition of Lorentz boosts,"" allowing us to transform to the rest frame
of a particle that is in a superposition of relativistic momenta with respect
to the laboratory frame. This enables us to first move to the particle's rest
frame, define the spin measurements there (via the Stern-Gerlach experimental
procedure), and then move back to the laboratory frame. In this way, we find a
set of ""relativistic Stern-Gerlach measurements"" in the laboratory frame, and a
set of observables satisfying the spin $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra. This
operational procedure offers a concrete way of testing the relativistic
features of the spin, and opens up the possibility of devising quantum
information protocols for spin in the special-relativistic regime.

of event cameras to generate high dynamic range(HDR) images even in extreme

shown.In addition, the possibility of generating very high frame rate videos is
demonstrated, theoretically up to 1 million frames per second (FPS) since the
temporal resolution of event cameras are about 1{\mu}s. Proposed methods are
evaluated by comparing the results with the intensity images captured on the

private and confidential data in a policy-compliant manner as traditional
database access control mechanisms cannot enforce complex policies. However,
application bugs due to missed checks are common in such applications, which
result in data breaches. While separating policy from code is a natural
solution, many data protection policies specify restrictions based on the
context in which data is accessed and how the data is used. Enforcing these
restrictions automatically presents significant challenges, as the information
needed to determine context requires a tight coupling between policy
enforcement and an application's implementation. We present Estrela, a
framework for enforcing contextual and granular data access policies. Working
from the observation that API endpoints can be associated with salient
contextual information in most database-backed applications, Estrela allows
developers to specify API-specific restrictions on data access and use. Estrela
provides a clean separation between policy specification and the application's
implementation, which facilitates easier auditing and maintenance of policies.
Policies in Estrela consist of pre-evaluation and post-evaluation conditions,
which provide the means to modulate database access before a query is issued,
and to impose finer-grained constraints on information release after the
evaluation of query, respectively. We build a prototype of Estrela and apply it
to retrofit several real world applications (from 1000-80k LOC) to enforce
different contextual policies. Our evaluation shows that Estrela can enforce
policies with minimal overheads.

arrive online over time at their release dates, and the task is to determine a

complete on time. To circumvent known impossibility results, we make a standard
slackness assumption by which the feasible time window for scheduling a job is
at least $1+\varepsilon$ times its processing time, for some $\varepsilon>0$.
We quantify the impact that different provider commitment requirements have on
the performance of online algorithms. Our main contribution is one universal
algorithmic framework for online job admission both with and without
commitments. Without commitment, our algorithm with a competitive ratio of
$O(1/\varepsilon)$ is the best possible (deterministic) for this problem. For
commitment models, we give the first non-trivial performance bounds. If the
commitment decisions must be made before a job's slack becomes less than a
$\delta$-fraction of its size, we prove a competitive ratio of
$O(\varepsilon/((\varepsilon-\delta)\delta^2))$, for $0<\delta<\varepsilon$.
When a provider must commit upon starting a job, our bound is
$O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. Finally, we observe that for scheduling with commitment
the restriction to the `unweighted' throughput model is essential; if jobs have

accelerated by the introduction of restart and those that display an opposite
response. In physical systems, a transition between the two classes may occur
as governing parameters are varied to cross a universal tipping point. However,
a fully tractable model system to teach us how this transition unfolds is still
lacking. To bridge this gap, we quantify the effect of stochastic restart on
the first-passage time of a drift-diffusion process to an absorbing boundary.
There, we find that the transition is governed by the P\'eclet number ($Pe$)
--- the ratio between the rates of advective and diffusive transport. When
$Pe>1$ the process is drift-controlled and restart can only hinder its
completion. In contrast, when $0\leq~Pe<1$ the process is diffusion-controlled
and restart can speed-up its completion by a factor of $\sim1/Pe$. Such speedup
occurs when the process is restarted at an optimal rate $r^{\star}\simeq
r_0^{\star}\left(1-Pe\right)$, where $r_0^{\star}$ stands for the optimal
restart rate in the pure-diffusion limit. The transition considered herein
stands at the core of restart phenomena and is relevant to a large variety of
processes that are driven to completion in the presence of noise. Each of these
processes has unique characteristics, but our analysis reveals that the restart
transition resembles other phase transitions --- some of its central features
are completely generic.

community. Two key characteristics in defining a planet as 'Earth-like' are
having a radius between 1 and 1.75 times the Earth's radius and orbiting inside
the host star's habitable zone; the measurement of the planet's radius and
related error is however possible only via transit observations and is highly
dependent on the precision of the host star's radius. A major improvement in
the determination of stellar radius is represented by the unprecedented
precision on parallax measurements provided by the Gaia astrometry satellite.
We present a new estimate of the frequency of Earth-sized planets orbiting
inside the host stars's habitable zones, obtained using Gaia measurements of
parallax for solar-type stars hosting validated planets in the Kepler field as
input for reassessing the values of planetary radius and incident stellar flux.
This updated occurrence rate can usefully inform future observational efforts

encapsulated gas microbubbles for improved visualization of the vascular bed
deep within the tissue. It has recently been used to enable imaging with
unprecedented subwavelength spatial resolution by relying on super-resolution
techniques. A typical preprocessing step in super-resolution ultrasound is to
separate the microbubble signal from the cluttering tissue signal. This step
has a crucial impact on the final image quality. Here, we propose a new
approach to clutter removal based on robust principle component analysis (PCA)
and deep learning. We begin by modeling the acquired contrast enhanced
ultrasound signal as a combination of a low rank and sparse components. This
model is used in robust PCA and was previously suggested in the context of
ultrasound Doppler processing and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging. We then
illustrate that an iterative algorithm based on this model exhibits improved
separation of microbubble signal from the tissue signal over commonly practiced
methods. Next, we apply the concept of deep unfolding to suggest a deep network
architecture tailored to our clutter filtering problem which exhibits improved
convergence speed and accuracy with respect to its iterative counterpart. We
compare the performance of the suggested deep network on both simulations and
in-vivo rat brain scans, with a commonly practiced deep-network architecture
and the fast iterative shrinkage algorithm, and show that our architecture
exhibits better image quality and contrast.

optimal portfolio choice remain unattainable out-of-sample due to large

number of vanishing moments in order for the ""filtering spectrum"" to be
meaningful. Our derivation follows a similar analysis by Perrier et al. 1995
for the wavelet spectrum, where we show that the filtering kernel has to have
at least $p$ vanishing moments in order to correctly extract a spectrum
$k^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha < p+2$. For example, any flow with a spectrum
shallower than $k^{-3}$ can be extracted by a straightforward average on
grid-cells of a stencil. We construct two new ""simple stencil"" kernels,
${\mathcal M}^{I}$ and ${\mathcal M}^{II}$, with only two and three fixed
stencil weight coefficients, respectively, and that have sufficient vanishing
moments to allow for extracting spectra steeper than $k^{-3}$. We demonstrate
our results using synthetic fields, 2D turbulence from a Direct Numerical
Simulation, and 3D turbulence from the JHU Database. Our method guarantees
energy conservation and can extract spectra of non-quadratic quantities
self-consistently, such as kinetic energy in variable density flows, which the
wavelet spectrum cannot. The method can be useful in both simulations and
experiments when a straightforward Fourier analysis is not justified, such as
within coherent flow structures covering non-rectangular regions, in
multi-phase flows, or in geophysical flows on Earth's curved surface.

warehouses and their automation arises, thus using robots as assistants to
human workers is becoming a priority. In order to operate efficiently and
safely, robot assistants or the supervising system should recognize human
intentions in real-time. Theory of mind (ToM) is an intuitive human conception
of other humans' mental state, i.e., beliefs and desires, and how they cause
behavior. In this paper we propose a ToM based human intention estimation
algorithm for flexible robotized warehouses. We observe human's, i.e., worker's
motion and validate it with respect to the goal locations using generalized
Voronoi diagram based path planning. These observations are then processed by
the proposed hidden Markov model framework which estimates worker intentions in
an online manner, capable of handling changing environments. To test the
proposed intention estimation we ran experiments in a real-world laboratory
warehouse with a worker wearing Microsoft Hololens augmented reality glasses.
Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the scalability of the approach to larger
warehouses, we propose to use virtual reality digital warehouse twins in order
to realistically simulate worker behavior. We conducted intention estimation
experiments in the larger warehouse digital twin with up to 24 running robots.
We demonstrate that the proposed framework estimates warehouse worker
intentions precisely and in the end we discuss the experimental results.

$\pm$5%, effects after the SSM saturation point are small. In particular, the
phase variations correspond to much less than a quarter wakefield period,
making deterministic injection of electrons (or positrons) into the
accelerating and focusing phase of the wakefields in principle possible. We use
the wakefields from the simulations and a simple test electron model to
estimate the same effects on the maximum final energies of electrons injected
along the plasma, which are found to be below the initial variations of
$\pm$5%. This analysis includes the dephasing of the electrons with respect to

the plasma leading to the largest energy gain. For the parameters taken here
(ratio of peak beam density to plasma density $n_{b0}/n_0 \approx 0.003$), we

irregular sampling, Time-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (T-CGAN).
Our approach is based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN),
where the generative step is implemented by a deconvolutional NN and the
discriminative step by a convolutional NN. Both the generator and the
discriminator are conditioned on the sampling timestamps, to learn the hidden
relationship between data and timestamps, and consequently to generate new time
series. We evaluate our model with synthetic and real-world datasets. For the
synthetic data, we compare the performance of a classifier trained with
T-CGAN-generated data, against the performance of the same classifier trained
on the original data. Results show that classifiers trained on T-CGAN-generated
data perform the same as classifiers trained on real data, even with very short
time series and small training sets. For the real world datasets, we compare
our method with other techniques of data augmentation for time series, such as
time slicing and time warping, over a classification problem with unbalanced
datasets. Results show that our method always outperforms the other approaches,
both in case of regularly sampled and irregularly sampled time series. We
achieve particularly good performance in case with a small training set and
short, noisy, irregularly-sampled time series.

by using the replica-trick: a mandatory tribute, given the special occasion.
Next, we show that the quenched free energy of this model is the functional
generator of the moments of the correlation matrix among the weights connecting
the two layers of the spin-glass (i.e., the Wishart matrix in random matrix
theory or the Hebbian coupling in neural networks): as weights are quenched
stochastic variables, this plays as a novel tool to inspect random matrices. In
particular, we find that the Stieltjes transform of the spectral density of the

energy of the bipartite spin-glass model. In this setup, we re-obtain the

language of probabilities and statistics is often used to describe
disagreements quantitatively. In practice, however, we want much more than
that. We want disagreements to be resolved. This leaves us with a substantial
knowledge gap which is often perceived as a lack of practical intuition
regarding probabilistic and statistical concepts.
  Take for instance the R\'enyi divergence which is a well-known statistical
quantity specifically designed as a measure of disagreement between
probabilistic models. Despite its widespread use in science and engineering,
the R\'enyi divergence remains a highly abstract axiomatically-motivated
measure. Certainly, it offers no practical insight as to how disagreements can
be resolved.
  Here we propose to address disagreements using the methods of financial
economics. In particular, we show how a large class of disagreements can be
transformed into investment opportunities. The expected financial performance
of such investments quantifies the amount of disagreement in a tangible way.
This provides intuition for statistical concepts such as the R\'enyi divergence
which becomes connected to the financial performance of optimized investments.
Investment optimization takes into account individual opinions as well as
attitudes towards risk. The result is a market-like social mechanism by which
funds flow naturally to support a more accurate view. Such social mechanisms
can help us with difficult disagreements (e.g., financial arguments concerning
the future climate).
  In terms of scientific validation, we used the findings of independent
neurophysiological experiments as well as our own research on the equity
premium.

that the overlap of two points chosen under Gibbs measures at different

same as for the random energy model when the two points are sampled at the same
temperature, we point out here that they are different when temperatures are
distinct: more precisely, we prove that the mean overlap of two points chosen
under Gibbs measures at different temperatures for the DGFF is strictly smaller
than the REM's one. Therefore, although neither of these models exhibits
temperature chaos, one could say that the DGFF is more chaotic in temperature
than the REM.

atmospheric metal pollution and dusty disks of single white dwarfs. Recent
observations show that 1 to 4 percent of single white dwarfs are accompanied by
dusty disks, while the occurrence rate of metal pollution is about 25 to 50
percent . The dusty disks and metal pollution have been associated with
accretion of remnant planetary systems around white dwarfs, yet the relation
between these two phenomena is still unclear. Here we suggest an evolutionary
scenario to link the two observational phenomena. By analyzing a sample of
metal polluted white dwarfs, we find that the mass accretion rate onto the
white dwarf generally follows a broken power law decay, which matches well with
the theoretical prediction, if assuming dust accretion is primarily driven by
Poynting-Robertson drag and the dust source is primarily delivered via
dynamically falling asteroids perturbed by a Jovian planet. The presence of
disks is mainly at the early stage (about 0.1 to 0.7 billion years) of the
whole process of metal pollution, which is detectable until about 8 billion
years, naturally explaining the fraction (about 2-16 percent) of metal-polluted
white dwarfs having dusty disks. The success of this scenario also implies that
the configuration of an asteroid belt with an outer gas giant might be common
around stars of several solar masses.

leveraging CNNs for real-time applications necessitates model compression
approaches that not only reduce the total number of parameters but reduce the

our compressed models can be used at run-time without requiring any special

containing the Bergman projection on the unit ball $B_n$ of $\mathbb C^n$. We
consider the $C^\star$-algebra $\mathcal{L}(L^2(B_n))$ of bounded operator
acting on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on $B_n$ with
respect to the standard probability measure. We search for spectral invariant
Fr\'{e}chet subalgebras of $\mathcal{L}(L^2(B_n))$ containing the Bergman
projection $P$ which is defined on $L^2(B_n)$ with values in the space of
holomorphic functions. We use the commutator method as introduced by Gramsch.
This method generalizes the work of Beals for the spectral invariance of
pseudodifferential operators. One need not to work on the H\""{o}rmander classes
but can describe the algebra of pseudodifferential operators as continuous
commutator between scales of Sobolev spaces. To connect the analytical
properties to the geometry of the unit ball, we search for linear tangent
vector fields $X$ on the the unit sphere $\partial B_n$ so that the commutator
$[X,P]$ has a continuous extension to $L^2(B_n)$. In comparison to the work of
Bauer in for the case of the Fischer-Fock space it turns out that the results
are completely different. Our first contribution states that the set of vector
fields which provides the $\Psi^\star$-algebra for the Fock space fails even to
provide a continuity with the Bergman projection in the case of the unit ball.
Our second contribution, is the construction of vector fields being tangent to
the unit sphere which provides a new $\Psi^\star$-algebra containing the
Bergman projection of the unit ball. We prove that every linear vector field on
the unit sphere commutes with the Bergman projection on the unit ball.

applications of AI (e.g. automated assistants, recommender systems). The
workhorse model for this task is the rational actor model - this amounts to
assuming that people have stable reward functions, discount the future
exponentially, and construct optimal plans. Under the rational actor assumption
techniques such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) can be used to infer a
person's goals from their actions. A competing model is the dual-system model.
Here decisions are the result of an interplay between a fast, automatic,
heuristic-based system 1 and a slower, deliberate, calculating system 2. We
generalize the dual system framework to the case of Markov decision problems
and show how to compute optimal plans for dual-system agents. We show that
dual-system agents exhibit behaviors that are incompatible with rational actor

behavior of dual-system agents can generate wrong inference about the agents'
goals and suggest interventions that actually reduce the agent's overall
utility. Finally, we adapt a simple IRL algorithm to correctly infer the goals
of dual system decision-makers. This allows us to make interventions that help,

feature maps as contextual cues to augment low-level feature maps via a spatial
and channel-wise attention style, preventing details from being covered by too
much semantics and making semantics and details complement each other. We
further propose a semantic segmentation branch to best utilize detection
supervision information meanwhile applying attention mechanism in a
self-supervised manner. The segmentation branch is supervised by weak
segmentation ground-truth (no extra annotation is required) in a hierarchical
manner, deprecated in the inference time so it wouldn't compromise the

improves the performance consistently across all benchmarks because it reduces

However, direct application of multivariate approaches such as sparse Canonical
Correlation Analysis (sCCA) applies on the vectorised elements of functional
connectivity across subjects and it does not guarantee that the predicted

suggest an elegant solution based on the transportation of the connectivity

Subsequently, the binomial distribution is exploited to set a threshold

user-friendly and open-source sparse matrix class for the C++ language, with a
high-level application programming interface deliberately similar to the widely
used MATLAB language. This facilitates prototyping directly in C++ and aids the
conversion of research code into production environments. The class internally
uses two main approaches to achieve efficient execution: (i) a hybrid storage
framework, which automatically and seamlessly switches between three underlying
storage formats (compressed sparse column, Red-Black tree, coordinate list)
depending on which format is best suited and/or available for specific
operations, and (ii) a template-based meta-programming framework to
automatically detect and optimise execution of common expression patterns.
Empirical evaluations on large sparse matrices with various densities of
non-zero elements demonstrate the advantages of the hybrid storage framework
and the expression optimisation mechanism.

dispersion relation of the mechanical waves to be determined, so that
calculating the exact specific heat turns out to be quite straightforward.
Then, the same problem is solved using the Debye approximation. Our findings
show that the specific heat of a nanocrystal evaluated exactly is higher than
the value found in the thermodynamic limit, that is to say, the specific heat
decreases as the nanocrystal size increases. In addition, it becomes clear that
the Debye model is a poor approximation for calculating the specific heat of a

cause of the discrepancy is found in the role of the nanocrystal surface.

fields is inferred through the detection of extended synchrotron radio sources
such as haloes and relics and implies that merger shocks and turbulence are
capable of (re-)accelerating particles to relativistic energies. However, the
precise relationship between merger shocks, turbulence, and extended radio
emission is still unclear. Studies of the most simple binary cluster mergers
are important to help understand the particle acceleration in the ICM. Our main
aim is to study the properties of the extended radio emission and particle
acceleration mechanism(s) associated with the generation of relativistic
particles in the ICM. We measure the low-frequency radio emission from the
merging galaxy cluster Abell 2146 with LOFAR at 144 MHz. We characterize the
spectral properties of the radio emission by combining these data with data
from archival GMRT at 238 MHz and 612 MHz and VLA at 1.5 GHz. We observe
extended radio emission at 144 MHz behind the NW and SE shocks. Across the NW
extended source, the spectral index steepens from $-1.06\pm0.06$ to
$-1.29\pm0.09$ in the direction of the cluster centre. This spectral behaviour
suggests that a relic is associated with the NW upstream shock. The precise
nature of the SE extended emission is unclear. It may be a radio halo bounded
by a shock or a superposition of a relic and halo. At 144 MHz, we detect a
faint emission that was not seen with high-frequency observations, implying a
steep ($\alpha<-1.3$) spectrum nature of the bridge emission. Our results imply
that the extended radio emission in Abell 2146 is probably associated with
shocks and turbulence during cluster merger. The relativistic electrons in the

spectral properties of extended cluster emission. The observational properties
are discussed in the framework of particle acceleration models associated with
cluster merger turbulence and shocks. In Abell 520, we confirm the presence of
extended synchrotron radio emission that has been classified as a radio halo.
The comparison between the radio and X-ray brightness suggests that the halo
might originate in a cocoon rather than from the central X-ray bright regions
of the cluster. The halo spectrum is roughly uniform on the scale of 66 kpc.
There is a hint of spectral steepening from the SW edge towards the cluster
centre. Assuming DSA, the radio data are suggestive of a shock of
$\mathcal{M}_{SW}=2.6_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$ that is consistent with the X-ray derived
estimates. This is in line with the scenario in which relativistic electrons in
the SW radio edge gain their energies at the shock front via acceleration of
either thermal or fossil electrons. We do not detect extended radio emission
ahead of the SW shock that is predicted if the emission is the result of
adiabatic compression. An X-ray surface brightness discontinuity is detected
towards the NE region that may be a counter shock of
$\mathcal{M}_{NE}^{X}=1.52\pm0.05$. This is lower than the value predicted from
the radio emission ($\mathcal{M}_{NE}=2.1\pm0.2$). Our observations indicate
that the SW radio emission in Abell 520 is likely effected by the prominent
X-ray detected shock in which radio emitting particles are (re-)accelerated
through the Fermi-I mechanism. The NE X-ray discontinuity that is approximately
collocated with an edge in the radio emission hints at the presence of a
counter shock.

inkjet printed hBN dielectric has a breakdown field of 1.9 \pm 0.3 MV cm^(-1).
Fully printed capacitors with sub-/mu m hBN layer thicknesses have also been
demonstrated. The capacitors are then exploited in two fully printed
demonstrators: a resistor-capacitor (RC) low-pass filter and a graphene-based
field effect transistor.

metamaterials is investigated via the method of multiple scales. Commonly
employed to the investigate the effect of weakly nonlinear interactions on the
free wave propagation through a phononic structure or on the dynamic response
of a Duffing oscillator, the method of multiple scales is here used to
investigate the forced wave propagation through locally resonant metamaterials.
The perturbation approach reveals that energy exchange may occur between
propagative and evanescent waves induced by quadratic nonlinear local
interaction.

computation of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange contribution in the HF and density
functional theory models. This takes inspiration from a recently developed
algorithm [Liu \emph{et al.}, J.~Chem.~Theor.~Comput.~ \textbf{13}, 2571
(2017)]. A key component is the accurate evaluation of electrostatic potential
integral, which is the rate-determining step. This introduces the Fourier
convolution theorem in conjunction with a range-separated Coulomb interaction
kernel. The latter is efficiently mapped into real grid through a simple
optimization procedure, giving rise to a constraint in the range-separated
parameter. The overall process offers logarithmic scaling with respect to
molecular size. It is then extended towards global hybrid functionals such as
B3LYP, PBE0 and BHLYP within pseudopotential Kohn-Sham theory, through an
LCAO-MO ansatz in Cartesian grid, developed earlier in our laboratory. For sake
of comparison, a parallel semi-numerical approach has also been worked out that
exploits the familiar Obara-Saika recursion algorithm. An excellent agreement
between these two routes is demonstrated through total energy and orbital
energy in a series of atoms and molecules (including 10 $\pi$-electron
molecules), employing an LANL2DZ-type basis function. A critical analysis of
these two algorithms reveals that the proposed numerical scheme could lead to
very attractive and competitive scaling. The success of our approach also
enables us for further development of optimally tuned range-separated hybrid
and hyper functionals.

measure electromagnetic and other radiation from beyond the Earth. Modern
observatories produce large, complex datasets and extracting the maximum
possible information from them requires the expertise of specialists in many
fields beyond physics and astronomy, from civil engineers to statisticians and
software engineers. This article introduces the essentials of professional
astronomical observations to colleagues in allied fields, to provide context
and relevant background for both facility construction and data analysis. It
covers the path of electromagnetic radiation through telescopes, optics,
detectors, and instruments, its transformation through processing into
measurements and information, and the use of that information to improve our
understanding of the physics of the cosmos and its history.

similar performance to ordinary back-propagation on challenging image datasets.
To overcome the unrealistic symmetry in connections between layers, implicit in
back-propagation, the feedback weights are separate from the feedforward
weights. The feedback weights are also updated with a local rule, the same as
the feedforward weights - a weight is updated solely based on the product of
activity of the units it connects. With fixed feedback weights as proposed in
Lillicrap et. al (2016) performance degrades quickly as the depth of the
network increases. If the feedforward and feedback weights are initialized with
the same values, as proposed in Zipser and Rumelhart (1990), they remain the
same throughout training thus precisely implementing back-propagation. We show
that even when the weights are initialized differently and at random, and the
algorithm is no longer performing back-propagation, performance is comparable
on challenging datasets. We also propose a cost function whose derivative can
be represented as a local Hebbian update on the last layer. Convolutional
layers are updated with tied weights across space, which is not biologically
plausible. We show that similar performance is achieved with untied layers,
also known as locally connected layers, corresponding to the connectivity
implied by the convolutional layers, but where weights are untied and updated
separately. In the linear case we show theoretically that the convergence of
the error to zero is accelerated by the update of the feedback weights.

eliminate manual operations that require expertise in machine learning. In this
paper, a graph-based architecture is employed to represent flexible
combinations of ML models, which provides a large searching space compared to
tree-based and stacking-based architectures. Based on this, an evolutionary
algorithm is proposed to search for the best architecture, where the mutation
and heredity operators are the key for architecture evolution. With Bayesian
hyper-parameter optimization, the proposed approach can automate the workflow
of machine learning. On the PMLB dataset, the proposed approach shows the
state-of-the-art performance compared with TPOT, Autostacker, and auto-sklearn.
Some of the optimized models are with complex structures which are difficult to
obtain in manual design.
