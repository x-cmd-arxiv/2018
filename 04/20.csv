  space: a review","PSS in press",,"10.1016/j.pss.2018.04.018",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Small bodies in the solar system are conventionally classified into asteroids
and comets. However, it is recently found that a small number of objects can
exhibit properties of both asteroids and comets. Some are more consistent with
asteroids despite episodic ejections and are labeled as ""active asteroids"",
while some might be aging comets with depleting volatiles. Ejecta produced by
active asteroids and/or dormant comets are potentially detectable as meteor
showers at the Earth if they are in Earth-crossing orbits, allowing us to
retrieve information about the historic activities of these objects. Meteor
showers from small bodies with low and/or intermittent activities are usually
weak, making shower confirmation and parent association challenging. We show
that statistical tests are useful for identifying likely parent-shower pairs.
Comprehensive analyses of physical and dynamical properties of meteor showers
can lead to deepen understanding on the history of their parents. Meteor
outbursts can trace to recent episodic ejections from the parents, and ""orphan""
showers may point to historic disintegration events. The flourish of NEO and
meteor surveys during the past decade has produced a number of high-confidence
parent-shower associations, most have not been studied in detail. More work is
needed to understand the formation and evolution of these parent-shower pairs.

procedure for the three-dimensional (3D) space fractional Allen-Cahn equation
can be divided into three steps. The first and third steps involve an ordinary
differential equation, which can be solved analytically. The intermediate step
involves a 3D linear fractional diffusion equation, which is solved by the
Crank-Nicolson alternating directional implicit (ADI) method. The ADI technique
can convert the multidimensional problem into a series of one-dimensional
problems, which greatly reduces the computational cost. A fourth-order
difference scheme is adopted for discretization of the space fractional
derivatives. Finally, Richardson extrapolation is exploited to increase the
temporal accuracy. The proposed method is shown to be unconditionally stable by
Fourier analysis. Another contribution of this paper is to show that the
numerical solutions satisfy the discrete maximum principle under reasonable
time step constraint. For fabricated smooth solutions, numerical results show
that the proposed method is unconditionally stable and fourth-order accurate in
both time and space variables. In addition, the discrete maximum principle is
also numerically verified.

been taken over by an entity with malicious intent. Since the adversary
exploits the already established trust of a compromised account, it is crucial
to detect these accounts to limit the damage they can cause. We propose a novel
general framework for semantic analysis of text messages coming out from an
account to detect compromised accounts. Our framework is built on the
observation that normal users will use language that is measurably different
from the language that an adversary would use when the account is compromised.
We propose to use the difference of language models of users and adversaries to
define novel interpretable semantic features for measuring semantic incoherence
in a message stream. We study the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
features using a Twitter data set. Evaluation results show that the proposed
framework is effective for discovering compromised accounts on social networks

consider a general mMIMO multi-way relaying system with a multi-level mixed-ADC
architecture, in which each antenna is connected to an ADC pair of an arbitrary
resolution. By leveraging on Bussgang's decomposition theorem and Lloyd-Max
algorithm for quantization, tight closed-form approximations are derived for
the average achievable rates of zero-forcing (ZF) relaying considering both
perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). To conquer the
challenges caused by multi-way relaying, the complicated ZF beam-forming
matrix, and the general mixed-ADC structure, we develop a novel method for the
achievable rate analysis using the singular-value decomposition (SVD) for
Gaussian matrices, distributions of the singular values of Gaussian matrices,

recently as it can lead to interesting small scale behavior. In particular,
this can lead to the formation of gravitationally bound clumps for these light
scalars, including axions. In Ref. [1] we analyzed the behavior of these
clumps, assuming spherical symmetry, allowing for both attractive and repulsive
self-interactions. There is a maximum allowed mass for the clumps in the case
of attractive interactions, and a minimum radius for the clumps in the case of
repulsive interactions, which is saturated at large mass. Here we extend this
work to include non-spherically symmetric clumps. Since the system tries to
re-organize into a BEC ground state, we consider configurations with a
conserved non-zero angular momentum, and construct minimum energy
configurations at fixed particle number and fixed angular momentum. We find
generalizations of the previous spherically symmetric results. In particular,
while there is still a maximum mass for the attractive case, its value
increases with angular momentum. Also, the minimum radius in the repulsive case
is raised to higher radii. We clarify how a recent claim in the literature of
an upper bound on angular momentum is due to inaccurate numerics. In a
forthcoming paper we shall investigate the possibility of resonance of axion
clumps into both visible and hidden sector photons, and analyze how the altered
mass and radius from non-zero angular momentum affects the resonance.

supervised learning scenarios, their dependence on sufficient labeled training
data in each class prevents effective applications of these deep models in
situations where labeled training instances for a subset of novel classes are
very sparse -- in the extreme case only one instance is available for each
class. To tackle this natural and important challenge, one-shot learning, which
aims to exploit a set of well labeled base classes to build classifiers for the
new target classes that have only one observed instance per class, has recently
received increasing attention from the research community. In this paper we
propose a novel end-to-end deep triplet ranking network to perform one-shot
learning. The proposed approach learns class universal image embeddings on the
well labeled base classes under a triplet ranking loss, such that the instances
from new classes can be categorized based on their similarity with the one-shot
instances in the learned embedding space. Moreover, our approach can naturally
incorporate the available one-shot instances from the new classes into the
embedding learning process to improve the triplet ranking model. We conduct
experiments on two popular datasets for one-shot learning. The results show the
proposed approach achieves better performance than the state-of-the- art
comparison methods.

system. In this report, the general problem of path planning is considered
first in partially known static environments where only static obstacles are
present but the layout of the environment is changing as the agent acquires new
information. Attention is then given to the problem of path planning in dynamic
environments where there are moving obstacles in addition to the static ones.
Specifically, a 2D car-like agent traversing in a 2D environment was
considered. It was found that the traditional configuration-time space approach
is unsuitable for producing trajectories consistent with the dynamic
constraints of a car. A novel scheme is then suggested where the state space is
4D consisting of position, speed and time but the search is done in the 3D
space composed by position and speed. Simulation tests shows that the new
scheme is capable of efficiently producing trajectories respecting the dynamic
constraint of a car-like agent with a bound on their optimality.

This turns to be a powerful approach because the same tangles appear as

Using these it was also shown that the intra-band plasmon dispersion for the
finite doping and the long wavelength limit involves the q2/3 (unconventional)
behaviour and not the well known q1/2 behaviour. In this paper the optical
conductivity and the optical properties of this vdWH are reported. We find that
there are no (inter-band) plasmons for electron doping as long as the Gr-TMD
hetero-structure is surrounded by the positive dielectric constant materials
above and below. However, if the heterostructure is surrounded by negative
dielectric constant (NDC) materials, one finds that there would be acoustic
plasmons. For the hole doping case NDC material is not required. We find that
the gate voltage tunable intra-band acoustic plasmons also emerge when the
carrier density is greater than a moderately critical value. The stronger
incarceration capability of GrTMD plasmon compared to that of doped graphene is
another notable outcome of the present work. One finds that the intra-band
absorbance is decreases with the frequency at a given gate voltage and
increases with the gate voltage at a given frequency; the inter-band
transmittance, however, is a decreasing function of frequency and the gate

complex objects is limited. Therefore, new designs need to be discovered that

produce a working, reliable mechanical spring. The proposed methodology for
discovering solutions to this problem consists of three components: First, an
effective search space is learned through a variational autoencoder (VAE);
second, a surrogate model for functional designs is built; and third, a genetic
algorithm is used to simultaneously update the hyperparameters of the surrogate
and to optimize the designs using the updated surrogate. Using a car-launcher
mechanism as a test domain, spring designs were 3D-printed and evaluated to
update the surrogate model. Two experiments were then performed: First, the
initial set of designs for the surrogate-based optimizer was selected randomly
from the training set that was used for training the VAE model, which resulted
in an exploitative search behavior. On the other hand, in the second
experiment, the initial set was composed of more uniformly selected designs
from the same training set and a more explorative search behavior was observed.
Both of the experiments showed that the methodology generates interesting,
successful, and reliable spring geometries robust to the noise inherent in the
3D printing process. The methodology can be generalized to other functional
design problems, thus making consumer-grade 3D printing more versatile.

orbital-selective spin fluctuation scenario. Within this approach, the
anisotropy of spin fluctuations below the spin-nematic transition at T$_S$ is
also responsible for the orbital ordering, induced by nematic self-energy
corrections to the quasiparticle dispersion. As a consequence, the anisotropy
of the dc conductivity below T$_S$ is determined not only by the anisotropy of
the scattering rates as expected within a spin-nematic scenario, but also by
the modification of the Fermi velocity due to the orbital reconstruction. More
interestingly, it turns out that these two effects contribute to the
dc-conductivity anisotropy with opposite signs. By using realistic
band-structure parameters we compute the conductivity anisotropy for both 122
and FeSe compounds, discussing the possible origin of the different
dc-conductivity anisotropy observed experimentally in these two families of
iron-based superconductors.

halo bias. While this scale dependence is absent in the large-scale limit for
single-field inflation models that satisfy the consistency relation, certain
models such as resonant non-Gaussianity show a peculiar behavior on
intermediate scales. We reconsider the predictions for the halo bias in this

the bias oscillates with scale with an envelope similar to that of equilateral
non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the bias shows a peculiar modulation with the halo

to interactions between the inflaton and massive fields: our results for the

ALMA at (sub-) millimeter-emission. We perform the analysis in the visibility
plane to characterize the total flux, cavity size, and shape of the ring-like
structure. First, we found that the $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_\star$ relation is much
flatter for TDs than the observed trends from samples of class II sources in
different star forming regions. This relation demonstrates that cavities open
in high (dust) mass disks, independent of the stellar mass. The flatness of
this relation contradicts the idea that TDs are a more evolved set of disks.
Two potential reasons (not mutually exclusive) may explain this flat relation:
the emission is optically thick or/and millimeter-sized particles are trapped
in a pressure bump. Second, we discuss our results of the cavity size and ring
width in the context of different physical processes for cavity formation.
Photoevaporation is an unlikely leading mechanism for the origin of the cavity
of any of the targets in the sample. Embedded giant planets or dead zones
remain as potential explanations. Although both models predict correlations
between the cavity size and the ring shape for different stellar and disk
properties, we demonstrate that with the current resolution of the
observations, it is difficult to obtain these correlations. Future observations
with higher angular resolution observations of TDs with ALMA will help to
discern between different potential origins of cavities in TDs.

remarkable sensitivities to even featureless signals, once restricting to
events coming through the Earth from the opposite side of the detector location
for the signals leaving appreciable tracks from which the source direction is
inferred. By doing so, potential backgrounds in the signal region of interest
can be substantially suppressed. To validate our claim, we study experimental

investigate the interplay of confinement, lattice commensuration, and disorder,
in the form of a random chemical potential. We begin by pointing out that the
ground state at commensurate filling spontaneously breaks the translational
symmetry of the lattice. This feature is absent in the conventional lattice
regularization, which breaks the relevant symmetry explicitly, but is present
in an alternative (symmetric) regularization that we introduce. Remarkably, the
spontaneous symmetry breaking survives the addition of a random chemical
potential (which explicitly breaks the relevant symmetry) in apparent
contradiction of the Imry-Ma theorem, which forbids symmetry breaking in one
dimension with this kind of disorder. We identify the long range interaction as
the key ingredient enabling the system to evade Imry-Ma constraints. We examine
spatially resolved energy level statistics for the disordered system, and
demonstrate that the low energy Hilbert space exhibits ergodicity breaking,
with level statistics that fail to follow random matrix theory. A careful
examination of the structure of low lying excited states reveals that disorder
induced localization is responsible for the deviations from random matrix
theory, and further reveals that the elementary excitations are charge neutral,

g}$) and for dark-matter haloes ($\lambda_{\rm h}$), indicated both by
simulations and observations, is naively interpreted as a one-to-one
correlation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to
predict galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via $R_{\rm e}\simeq\lambda_{\rm
h} R_{\rm v}$, with $R_{\rm e}$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and $R_{\rm
v}$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites of zoom-in cosmological
simulations, we find that $\lambda_{\rm g}$ and $\lambda_{\rm h}$ are in fact
only barely correlated, especially at $z\geq 1$. A general smearing of this
correlation is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more
recently accreted baryons through streams gain and then lose significant
angular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated dark matter. Expecting
the spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into $R_{\rm
v}$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between
$\lambda_{\rm g}/\lambda_{\rm h}$ and $\lambda_{\rm h}$, which can partly arise
from mergers and a compact star-forming phase that many galaxies undergo. On
the other hand, the halo and galaxy spin vectors tend to be aligned, with a
median $\cos\theta=0.6$-0.7 between galaxy and halo, consistent with
instreaming within a preferred plane. The galaxy spin is better correlated with
the spin of the inner halo, but this largely reflects the effect of the baryons
on the halo. Following the null spin correlation, $\lambda_{\rm h}$ is not a
useful proxy for $R_{\rm e}$. While our simulations reproduce a general
relation of the sort $R_{\rm e}=AR_{\rm vir}$, in agreement with observational
estimates, the relation becomes tighter with $A=0.02(c/10)^{-0.7}$, where $c$
is the halo concentration, which in turn introduces a dependence on mass and
redshift.

an astrophysical phenomenon predicted by cosmological simulations. This
phenomenon, called the blue nugget (BN) phase, is the compact star-forming
phase in the central regions of many growing galaxies that follows an earlier
phase of gas compaction and is followed by a central quenching phase. We train
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with mock ""observed"" images of simulated
galaxies at three phases of evolution: pre-BN, BN and post-BN, and demonstrate
that the CNN successfully retrieves the three phases in other simulated
galaxies. We show that BNs are identified by the CNN within a time window of
$\sim0.15$ Hubble times. When the trained CNN is applied to observed galaxies
from the CANDELS survey at $z=1-3$, it successfully identifies galaxies at the
three phases. We find that the observed BNs are preferentially found in
galaxies at a characteristic stellar mass range, $10^{9.2-10.3} M_\odot$ at all
redshifts. This is consistent with the characteristic galaxy mass for BNs as
detected in the simulations, and is meaningful because it is revealed in the
observations when the direct information concerning the total galaxy luminosity
has been eliminated from the training set. This technique can be applied to the
classification of other astrophysical phenomena for improved comparison of
theory and observations in the era of large imaging surveys and cosmological

radiation field within a few thousand times the sublimation radius (R_sub), but
it often peaks at distances greater than 1000 R_sub. One possibility is that
the SF is contributing to the [SIV] total flux. We found an 11.3 micron PAH
emission deficit within the inner few tens of parsecs from the AGN. This
deficit might be due to the destruction of the molecules responsible for this

see how these parameters influence the resulting X-ray and optical light
curves. Among our models, we identify one that is able to roughly reproduce
both optical and X-ray data of the well observed SN 2013ej. In order to achieve
this, the slope of the dense CSM in this model should be steeper than the one

conclude that in this scenario the electroweak phase transition can naturally
be first-order, allowing for electroweak baryogenesis. We then extensively
discuss possible options to generate a sufficient amount of CP violation -
another key ingredient of baryogenesis - from quark Yukawa couplings which vary
during the phase transition. For one such an option, with a varying charm quark
Yukawa coupling, we perform a full numerical analysis of tunnelling in the

bring new opportunities and strong motivations for electroweak baryogenesis.

primordial Universe may be probed through the properties of the primordial
density perturbations responsible for the origin of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies and the large-scale structure of our Universe.
Isocurvature fields -fields orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory- may have
fluctuated across the barriers separating local minima of the landscape
potential during inflation. We analyze how this process could have impacted the
evolution of the primordial curvature perturbations. If the typical distance
separating consecutive minima of the landscape potential and the height of the
potential barriers are smaller than the Hubble expansion rate parametrizing
inflation, the probability distribution function of isocurvature fields becomes
non-Gaussian due to the appearance of bumps and dips associated to the
structure of the potential. We show that this non-Gaussianity can be
transferred to the statistics of primordial curvature perturbations if the
isocurvature fields are coupled to the curvature perturbations. The type of
non-Gaussian structure that emerges in the distribution of curvature
perturbations cannot be fully probed with the standard methods of polyspectra;
instead, the probability distribution function is needed. The latter is
obtained by summing all the $n$-point correlation functions. To substantiate
our claims, we offer a concrete model consisting of an axionlike isocurvature
perturbation with a sinusoidal potential and a linear derivative coupling
between the isocurvature and curvature fields. In this model, the probability
distribution function of the curvature perturbations consists of a Gaussian
function with small superimposed oscillations reflecting the isocurvature axion
potential.

increasing neutrino emission after core helium exhaustion leads to an
accelerated contraction of the whole star, inducing a strong spin-up, and
centrifugally driven mass loss at rates of up to
$10^{-2}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last years to decades before core
collapse. Since the angular momentum transport in our lower mass models
enhances the envelope spin-up, they show the largest relative amounts of

between ~0.15 Msun and ~0.30 Msun, constitute a new class of variable stars
showing g- and possibly p-mode pulsations with periods between 320 and 6000 s,
while main sequence delta Scuti stars, with masses between 1.2-2.5 Msun,
pulsate in low-order g and p modes with periods in the range [700-28800] s.
Interestingly enough, the instability strips of pre-ELM white dwarf and delta

degeneracy when spectroscopy is the only tool to classify the stars and
pulsation periods only are considered. We employ adiabatic and non-adiabatic
pulsation for models of pre-ELM and delta Scuti stars, and compare their
pulsation periods, period spacings and rates of period change. We found
substantial differences in the periods spacing of delta Scuti and pre-ELM white
dwarf models. Even when the same period range is observed, the modes have
distinctive signature in the period spacing and period difference values. For
instance, the mean period difference of p- modes of consecutive radial orders
for delta Scuti model are at least four times longer than the mean period
spacing for the pre-ELM white dwarf model in the period range [2000 - 4600] s.
In addition, the rate of period change is two orders of magnitudes larger for
the pre-ELM white dwarfs compared to delta Scuti stars. In addition, we also
report the discovery of a new variable star, SDSSJ075738.94+144827.50, located
in the region of the Teff vs. log g diagram where these two kind of stars
coexist. The characteristic spacing between modes of consecutive radial orders
(p as well as g modes) and the large differences found in the rates of period

asteroseismology can be employed to discriminate between these two groups of

Mathematically it states that the positive hull generated by the charges of the

have tested this conjecture in many heterotic $N=1$ compactifications in 4D.
Our motivation for this conjecture is that it allows to understand a very old

The conjecture guarantees that there is always a D-flat direction cancelling
the FI-term and restoring $N=1$ SUSY in a nearby vacuum. This is something that
has being verified in the past in a large number of cases, but whose origin has
remained obscure for decades. We argue that the existence of this lattice of

stochastic optimization problem defined over a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space

method to solve it, which, owing to the structure of the RKHS, admits a

Our approach provides stand-alone eyetracking based English proficiency scores

strongly with standardized English proficiency tests. We also demonstrate that

Our approach yields the strongest performance when the test taker is presented

systems. Traditionally, numerical integration methods are adopted by simulation
software to solve nonlinear power system differential-algebraic equations about
any given contingency under a specific operating condition. An alternative
approach promising for online simulation is to offline derive a semi-analytical
solution (SAS) and then online evaluate the SAS over consecutive time windows
regarding the operating condition and contingency until obtaining the
simulation result over a desired period. This paper proposes a general
semi-analytical approach that derives and evaluates an SAS in the form of power
series in time to approximate the solutions of power system differential
equations. An error-rate upper bound of the SAS is also proposed to guarantee
the reliable use of adaptive time windows for evaluation of the SAS. A dynamic
bus method is proposed to extend the semi-analytical approach for solving
general power system DAEs by efficiently linking the SASs for dynamic
components through the numerical solution of the network algebraic equations.
Case studies performed on the New England 39-bus system and the Polish 2383-bus
system test the performance of the proposed semi-analytical approach and
compare to existing methods. The results show that the SAS based approach has
potentials for online simulations.

the Drazin inverse is that it does not generally preserve the rank of the

spacecraft show that Toutatis has an elongated contact binary configuration,
with the contact point located along the long axis. We speculate that such
configuration may have resulted from a low-speed impact between two components.
In this work, we performed a series of numerical simulations and compared the
results with the optical images, to examine the mechanism and better understand
the formation of Toutatis. Herein we propose an scenario that an assumed
separated binary precursor could undergo a close encounter with Earth, leading
to an impact between the primary and secondary, and the elongation is caused by
Earth's tide. The precursor is assumed to be a doubly synchronous binary with a
semi-major axis of 4 $R_p$ (radius of primary) and the two components are
represented as spherical cohesionless self-gravitating granular aggregates. The
mutual orbits are simulated in a Monte Carlo routine to provide appropriate
parameters for our \emph{N}-body simulations of impact and tidal distortion. We
employ the \emph{pkdgrav} package with a soft-sphere discrete element method
(SSDEM) to explore the entire scenarios. The results show that contact binary
configurations are natural outcomes under this scenario, whereas the shape of
the primary is almost not affected by the impact of the secondary. However, our
simulations further provide an elongated contact binary configuration
best-matching to the shape of Toutatis at an approaching distance $r_p$ = 1.4
$\sim$ 1.5 $R_e$ (Earth radius), indicative of a likely formation scenario for
configurations of Toutatis-like elongated contact binaries.

allowed for the first standard-siren measurement of the Hubble constant, with
an uncertainty of $\sim 14\%$. As more detections of binary neutron stars with
redshift measurement are made, the uncertainty will shrink. The dominating
factors will be the number of joint detections and the uncertainty on the
luminosity distance of each event. Neutron star black hole mergers are also
promising sources for advanced LIGO and Virgo. If the black hole spin induces
precession of the orbital plane, the degeneracy between luminosity distance and
the orbital inclination is broken, leading to a much better distance
measurement. In addition neutron star black hole sources are observable to
larger distances, owing to their higher mass. Neutron star black holes could
also emit electromagnetic radiation: depending on the black hole spin and on
the mass ratio, the neutron star can be tidally disrupted resulting in
electromagnetic emission. We quantify the distance uncertainty for a wide range
of black hole mass, spin and orientations and find that the 1-$\sigma$
statistical uncertainty can be up to a factor of $\sim 10$ better than for a
non-spinning binary neutron star merger with the same signal-to-noise ratio.
The better distance measurement, the larger gravitational-wave detectable
volume, and the potentially bright electromagnetic emission, imply that
spinning black hole neutron star binaries can be the optimal standard siren
sources as long as their astrophysical rate is larger than $O(10)$
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, a value allowed by current astrophysical constraints.

dimensionality of HSI. These methods fail to capture non-linear dependency in
the HSI data, as data lies in the nonlinear manifold. To handle this, nonlinear
transformation techniques based on kernel methods were introduced for
dimensionality reduction of HSI. However, the kernel methods involve cubic
computational complexity while computing the kernel matrix, and thus its
potential cannot be explored when the number of pixels (samples) are large. In
literature a fewer number of pixels are randomly selected to partial to
overcome this issue, however this sub-optimal strategy might neglect important

from three different perspectives: a) the studies of association between the
units that are combined, b) the distribution of this combination of units in
the corpus, and finally c) the ways of measuring similarity between units
according to the combination possibilities. All these topics are addressed in a
strictly theoretical fashion and are illustrated by examples of practical
application in terminology and in documentation. The objective is to
demonstrate that the use of statistical tools in these fields is a necessary

discourage user participation and engagement. Therefore, it is crucial for and
a common goal of platform managers to diminish hateful and harmful content.
Over the last year, Reddit, a major online platform, enacted a policy of
banning sub-communities (subreddits) that they deem harassing, with the goal of
diminishing such activities. We studied the effects of banning the largest
hateful subreddit (r/fatpeoplehate or FPH) on the users and other subreddits
that were associated with it. We found that, while a number of outcomes were
possible --- in this case the subreddit ban led to a sustained reduced
interaction of its members (FPH users) with the Reddit platform. We also found
that the many counter-actions taken by FPH users were short-lived and promptly
neutralized by both Reddit administrators and the admins of individual
subreddits. Our findings show that forum-banning can be an effective means by
which to diminish objectionable content. Moreover, our detailed analysis of the
post-banning behavior of FPH users highlights a number of the behavioral

the energy cascade towards small scales, leading to the breaking and steepening

displays a scaling that is close to the spectral index $-2.2$ as proposed by
recent analytic theories. We also demonstrate that the scale-dependent dynamic

classical statistical way - has been proposed as a resource that powers quantum
computing. The measurement-based model provides a concrete manifestation of
contextuality as a computational resource, as follows. If local measurements on
a multi-qubit state can be used to evaluate non-linear boolean functions with
only linear control processing, then this computation constitutes a proof of
strong contextuality - the possible local measurement outcomes cannot all be
pre-assigned. However, this connection is restricted to the special case when
the local measured systems are qubits, which have unusual properties from the
perspective of contextuality. A single qubit cannot allow for a proof of
contextuality, unlike higher-dimensional systems, and multiple qubits can allow
for state-independent contextuality with only Pauli observables, again unlike
higher-dimensional generalisations. Here we identify precisely that strong
non-locality is necessary in a qudit measurement-based computation that
evaluates high-degree polynomial functions with only linear control. We
introduce the concept of local universality, which places a bound on the space
of output functions accessible under the constraint of single-qudit
measurements. Thus, the partition of a physical system into subsystems plays a
crucial role for the increase in computational power. A prominent feature of
our setting is that the enabling resources for qubit and qudit
measurement-based computations are of the same underlying nature, avoiding the
pathologies associated with qubit contextuality.

and for clarity we use both the metric and tetrad language. For $f(T)$ gravity
we verify the result that no further polarization modes comparing to general
relativity are present at first-order perturbation level, and we show that in
order to see extra modes one should look at third-order perturbations. For
non-trivial $f(T,B)$ gravity, by examining the geodesic deviation equations, we
show that extra polarization models, namely the longitudinal and breathing
modes, do appear at first-order perturbation level, and the reason for this
behavior is the fact that although the first-order perturbation does not have
any effect on $T$, it does affect the boundary term $B$. Finally, for
$f(T,T_G)$ gravity we show that at first-order perturbations the gravitational
waves exhibit the same behavior to those of $f(T)$ gravity. Since different

the dvancing gravitational-wave astronomy would help to alleviate the

Moreover, in this case an additional condition on the action ensures that the
quotient poset is Cohen-Macaulay in characteristic 0 and every characteristic

property for the associated Stanley-Reisner rings. In particular, this holds
for independence posets and rings associated to toric, elliptic and, more

tasks; however, these algorithms typically include a deep neural network (DNN)
structure and a large number of parameters, which makes it challenging to
implement them on power/area-constrained embedded platforms. To reduce the
network size, several studies investigated compression by introducing
element-wise or row-/column-/block-wise sparsity via pruning and
regularization. In addition, many recent works have focused on reducing
precision of activations and weights with some reducing down to a single bit.
However, combining various sparsity structures with binarized or
very-low-precision (2-3 bit) neural networks have not been comprehensively
explored. In this work, we present design techniques for minimum-area/-energy
DNN hardware with minimal degradation in accuracy. During training, both
binarization/low-precision and structured sparsity are applied as constraints
to find the smallest memory footprint for a given deep learning algorithm. The
DNN model for CIFAR-10 dataset with weight memory reduction of 50X exhibits
accuracy comparable to that of the floating-point counterpart. Area,
performance and energy results of DNN hardware in 40nm CMOS are reported for
the MNIST dataset. The optimized DNN that combines 8X structured compression
and 3-bit weight precision showed 98.4% accuracy at 20nJ per classification.

  two-sample summary-data Mendelian randomization","46 pages",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-sample summary-data Mendelian randomization (MR) has become a popular
research design to estimate the causal effect of risk exposures. With the
sample size of GWAS continuing to increase, it is now possible to utilize
genetic instruments that are only weakly associated with the exposure. To
maximize the statistical power of MR, we propose a genome-wide design where
more than a thousand genetic instruments are used. For the statistical
analysis, we use an empirical partially Bayes approach where instruments are
weighted according to their strength, thus weak instruments bring less
variation to the estimator. The estimator is highly efficient with many weak
genetic instruments and is robust to balanced and/or sparse pleiotropy. We
apply our method to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) and
major blood lipids on cardiovascular disease outcomes and obtain substantially
shorter confidence intervals. Some new and statistically significant findings
are: the estimated causal odds ratio of BMI on ischemic stroke is 1.19 (95% CI:
1.07--1.32, p-value < 0.001); the estimated causal odds ratio of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on coronary artery disease (CAD) is 0.78 (95%
CI 0.73--0.84, p-value < 0.001). However, the estimated effect of HDL-C becomes
substantially smaller and statistically non-significant when we only use the
strong instruments. By employing a genome-wide design and robust statistical
methods, the statistical power of MR studies can be greatly improved. Our
empirical results suggest that, even though the relationship between HDL-C and
CAD appears to be highly heterogeneous, it may be too soon to completely
dismiss the HDL hypothesis.

The Pop~III SFRD, however, reaches a plateau at $\sim10^{-3}\ \Msun{\rm

formation (i.e. primordial haloes). We predict that Pop~III-only galaxies exist
at magnitudes $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -11$, beyond the limits for direct detection
with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)}. We assess that our stellar
mass function (SMF) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) agree well with the
observed low mass/faint-end behavior at $z=8$ and $10$. However, beyond the
current limiting magnitudes, we find that both our SMF and UVLF demonstrate a
deviation/turnover from the expected power-law slope ($M_{\rm UV,turn}=
-13.4\pm1.1$ at $z$=10). This could impact observational estimates of the true
SFRD by a factor of $2 (10)$ when integrating to $M_{\rm UV} = -$12 ($-$8) at

the transition from dark matter haloes dominated by molecular cooling to those

research interest. In this field, the most important issue is the validation of
the model itself of follower force, a nonconservative action which was harshly
criticized and never realized in practice for structures with diffused
elasticity. An experimental setup to introduce follower tangential forces at
the end of an elastic rod was designed, realized, validated, and tested, in
which the follower action is produced by exploiting Coulomb friction on an
element (a freely-rotating wheel) in sliding contact against a flat surface
(realized by a conveyor belt). It is therefore shown that follower forces can
be realized in practice and the first experimental evidence is given for both
the flutter and divergence instabilities occurring in the Pfluger's column. In
particular, load thresholds for the two instabilities are measured and the
detrimental effect of dissipation on the critical load for flutter is
experimentally demonstrated, while a slight increase in load is found for the
divergence instability. The presented approach to follower forces discloses new
horizons for testing self-oscillating structures and for exploring and
documenting dynamic instabilities possible when nonconservative loads are

we utilize three different methods (autocorrelation, periodogram, Gaussian
Processes). The median period for brown dwarfs with disks is twice as long as
for those without (3.1 vs. 1.6 d), a signature of rotational braking by the
disk, albeit with small numbers. With an overall median period of 1.9 d, brown
dwarfs in Taurus rotate slower than their counterparts in somewhat older (3-10
Myr) star-forming regions, consistent with spin-up of the latter due to
contraction and angular momentum conservation, a clear sign that disk braking
overall is inefficient and/or temporary in this mass domain. We confirm the
presence of a linear increase of the typical rotation period as a function of
mass in the sub-stellar regime. The rotational velocities, when calculated
forward to the age of the solar system assuming angular momentum conservation,
fit the known spin-mass relation for solar system planets and extra-solar

However, distributed random number generation is notoriously difficult. Systems
that derive randomness from the previous blocks are completely insecure;
solutions that provide secure random selection are inefficient due to their
high communication complexity; and approaches that balance security and
performance exhibit selection bias. When block creation is rewarded with new
stake, even a minor bias can have a severe cumulative effect.
  In this paper, we propose Robust Round Robin, a new consensus scheme that
addresses this selection problem. We create reliable long-term identities by
bootstrapping from an existing infrastructure, such as Intel's SGX processors,
or by mining them starting from an initial fair distribution. For leader
selection we use a deterministic approach. On each round, we select a set of
the previously created identities as consensus leader candidates in round robin
manner. Because simple round-robin alone is vulnerable to attacks and offers
poor liveness, we complement such deterministic selection policy with a
lightweight endorsement mechanism that is an interactive protocol between the
leader candidates and a small subset of other system participants. Our solution
has low good efficiency as it requires no expensive distributed randomness
generation and it provides block creation fairness which is crucial in
deployments that reward it with new stake.

it is optimal to trade towards the frictionless Merton position, taking into

when the CSI is known at both the transmitter and the receiver (the CSI case).
For these two cases, we develop the corresponding optimal dynamic power

suboptimal schemes with low complexities. Comparing the proposed schemes to the
existing schemes, we provide various useful and interesting insights into the
dynamic power splitting for the nonlinear EH. Furthermore, we extend the

In order to apply the CA approach, we introduce an action principle for the
null fluid which sources the Vaidya geometries, and we carefully examine the
contribution of the null shell to the action. Further, we find that adding a
particular counterterm on the null boundaries of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch is
essential if the gravitational action is to properly describe the complexity of
the boundary state. For both the CV proposal and the CA proposal (with the

'Newtonian abduction', that does provide confirmation for frameworks as a
whole, and does so in two novel ways. (In particular, Newtonian abduction is
not inference to the best explanation, but rather is closer to Peirce's
original idea of abduction.) I further argue that Newtonian abduction is at
least as important a form of reasoning in science as standard deductive and
inductive forms. The form is beautifully summed up by Maxwell (1876): ""The true
method of physical reasoning is to begin with the phenomena and to deduce the

goal to efficiently select a high proportion of relevant predictors. Different
from existing studies in power analysis and sure screening, we propose to
directly estimate the false negative proportion (FNP) of a decision rule and
select the smallest subset of predictors that has the estimated FNP less than a
user-specified control level. The proposed method is adaptive to the
user-specified control level on FNP by selecting less candidates if a higher
level is implemented. On the other hand, when data has stronger effect size or
larger sample size, the proposed method controls FNP more efficiently with less
false positives. New analytic techniques are developed to cope with the major
challenge of FNP control when relevant predictors cannot be consistently
separated from irrelevant ones. Our numerical results are in line with the

about the effects of resonant and random excitations on proton losses,
emittances, and beam distributions in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In
addition to shedding light on complex nonlinear effects, these studies are
applied to the design of hollow electron lenses (HEL) for active beam halo
control. In the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), a considerable
amount of energy will be stored in the beam tails. To control and clean the
beam halo, the installation of two hollow electron lenses, one per beam, is
being considered. In standard electron-lens operation, a proton bunch sees the
same electron current at every revolution. Pulsed electron beam operation
(i.e., different currents for different turns) is also considered, because it
can widen the range of achievable halo removal rates. For an axially symmetric
electron beam, only protons in the halo are excited. If a residual field is
present at the location of the beam core, these particles are exposed to
time-dependent transverse kicks and to noise. We discuss the numerical
simulations and the experiments conducted in 2016 and 2017 at injection energy
in the LHC. The excitation patterns were generated by the transverse feedback
and damping system, which acted as a flexible source of dipole kicks. Proton
beam losses, emittances, and transverse distributions were recorded as a
function of excitation patterns and strengths. The resonant excitations induced
rich dynamical effects and nontrivial changes of the beam distributions, which,
to our knowledge, have not previously been observed and studied in this detail.
We conclude with a discussion of the tolerable and achievable residual fields
and proposals for further studies.

  Chinese Statistical Association (ICSA) Applied Statistics Symposium",,"10.1111/biom.13060",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Longitudinal data are common in clinical trials and observational studies,
where missing outcomes due to dropouts are always encountered. Under such
context with the assumption of missing at random, the weighted generalized
estimating equations (WGEE) approach is widely adopted for marginal analysis.
Model selection on marginal mean regression is a crucial aspect of data
analysis, and identifying an appropriate correlation structure for model
fitting may also be of interest and importance. However, the existing
information criteria for model selection in WGEE have limitations, such as
separate criteria for the selection of marginal mean and correlation
structures, unsatisfactory selection performance in small-sample set-ups and so
on. In particular, there are few studies to develop joint information criteria
for selection of both marginal mean and correlation structures. In this work,
by embedding empirical likelihood into the WGEE framework, we propose two
innovative information criteria named a joint empirical Akaike information
criterion (JEAIC) and a joint empirical Bayesian information criterion (JEBIC),
which can simultaneously select the variables for marginal mean regression and
also correlation structure. Through extensive simulation studies, these
empirical-likelihood-based criteria exhibit robustness, flexibility, and
outperformance compared to the other criteria including the weighted
quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion, the missing
longitudinal information criterion and the joint longitudinal information
criterion. In addition, we provide a theoretical justification of our proposed
criteria, and present two real data examples in practice for further
illustration.

Our definitions
are motivated by one of the most universal signatures of social networks,
triadic closure---the property that pairs of vertices with common neighbors
tend to be adjacent. Our most basic definition is that of a ""$c$-closed"" graph,
where for every pair of vertices $u,v$ with at least $c$ common neighbors, $u$
and $v$ are adjacent. We study the classic problem of enumerating all maximal
cliques, an important task in social network analysis. We prove that this
problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $c$ on $c$-closed graphs.
Our results carry over to ""weakly $c$-closed graphs"", which only require a
vertex deletion ordering that avoids pairs of non-adjacent vertices with $c$
common neighbors. Numerical experiments show that well-studied social networks
tend to be weakly $c$-closed for modest values of $c$.

Using time segmentation, we reformulate the field inhomogeneity compensation

Fourier measurements. The temporal profile at each pixel is modeled as a single
exponential, which is exploited to fill in the missing entries. We show that
the exponential behavior at each pixel, along with the spatial smoothness of
the exponential parameters, can be exploited to derive a 3D annihilation
relation in the Fourier domain. This relation translates to a low rank property
on a structured multi-fold Toeplitz matrix, whose entries correspond to the
measured k-space samples. We introduce a fast two-step algorithm for the
completion of the Toeplitz matrix from the available samples. In the first
step, we estimate the null space vectors of the Toeplitz matrix using only its
fully sampled rows. The null space is then used to estimate the signal
subspace, which facilitates the efficient recovery of the time series of

provides the optimal results but to reduce the time-consumption, we resort to
the derived rate limits and propose the second selection scheme based on the

The first of these cases has been studied before as it covers many new physics
extensions of the standard model; the second one requires the existence of a
new light (sterile) right-handed neutrino and its contribution to both
branching ratios is always additive to the SM. The case of neutrino LFV
couplings introduces a CP conserving contribution to $K_L \to \pi^0 \nu
\bar\nu$ which affects the rates in a similar manner as a right handed neutrino
as neither one of these interferes with the standard model amplitudes. Finally,
we consider new physics with $\Delta I =3/2$ interactions to go beyond the

physics scales up to a few GeV for this scenario.

auction design, and many (approximately) optimal dominant-strategy incentive
compatible (DSIC) Bayesian mechanisms have been constructed for various auction
settings. However, most existing studies do not consider the complexity for the
seller to carry out the mechanism. It is assumed that the seller knows ""each
single bit"" of the distributions and is able to optimize perfectly based on the
entire distributions. Unfortunately, this is a strong assumption and may not
hold in reality: for example, when the value distributions have exponentially
large supports or do not have succinct representations.
  In this work we consider, for the first time, the query complexity of
Bayesian mechanisms. We only allow the seller to have limited oracle accesses
to the players' value distributions, via quantile queries and value queries.
For a large class of auction settings, we prove logarithmic lower-bounds for
the query complexity for any DSIC Bayesian mechanism to be of any constant
approximation to the optimal revenue. For single-item auctions and multi-item
auctions with unit-demand or additive valuation functions, we prove tight
upper-bounds via efficient query schemes, without requiring the distributions
to be regular or have monotone hazard rate. Thus, in those auction settings the
seller needs to access much less than the full distributions in order to
achieve approximately optimal revenue.

attention thanks to the accessibility and the popularity of 3D skeleton data.
One of the key challenges in skeleton-based action recognition lies in the
large view variations when capturing data. In order to alleviate the effects of
view variations, this paper introduces a novel view adaptation scheme, which
automatically determines the virtual observation viewpoints in a learning based
data driven manner. We design two view adaptive neural networks, i.e., VA-RNN
based on RNN, and VA-CNN based on CNN. For each network, a novel view
adaptation module learns and determines the most suitable observation
viewpoints, and transforms the skeletons to those viewpoints for the end-to-end
recognition with a main classification network. Ablation studies find that the
proposed view adaptive models are capable of transforming the skeletons of
various viewpoints to much more consistent virtual viewpoints which largely
eliminates the viewpoint influence. In addition, we design a two-stream scheme
(referred to as VA-fusion) that fuses the scores of the two networks to provide
the fused prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations on five challenging
benchmarks demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed view-adaptive
networks and superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. The source

dimension, or doubling metrics) are well understood. This lies in contrast to
the situation in high dimensional spaces, where except for the work of
Har-Peled, Indyk and Sidiropoulos (SODA 2013), who showed that any $n$-point
Euclidean metric has an $O(t)$-spanner with $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/t^2})$ edges,
little is known.
  In this paper we study several aspects of spanners in high dimensional normed
spaces. First, we build spanners for finite subsets of $\ell_p$ with $1<p\le
2$. Second, our construction yields a spanner which is both sparse and also
{\em light}, i.e., its total weight is not much larger than that of the minimum
spanning tree. In particular, we show that any $n$-point subset of $\ell_p$ for
$1<p\le 2$ has an $O(t)$-spanner with $n^{1+\tilde{O}(1/t^p)}$ edges and
lightness $n^{\tilde{O}(1/t^p)}$.
  In fact, our results are more general, and they apply to any metric space
admitting a certain low diameter stochastic decomposition. It is known that
arbitrary metric spaces have an $O(t)$-spanner with lightness $O(n^{1/t})$. We
exhibit the following tradeoff: metrics with decomposability parameter
$\nu=\nu(t)$ admit an $O(t)$-spanner with lightness $\tilde{O}(\nu^{1/t})$. For
example, $n$-point Euclidean metrics have $\nu\le n^{1/t}$, metrics with
doubling constant $\lambda$ have $\nu\le\lambda$, and graphs of genus $g$ have
$\nu\le g$. While these families do admit a ($1+\epsilon$)-spanner, its
lightness depend exponentially on the dimension (resp. $\log g$). Our
construction alleviates this exponential dependency, at the cost of incurring
larger stretch.

locate bifurcations. Geodesics connecting two points are an example of a
Hamiltonian boundary value problem, and we introduce the jet-RATTLE method, a
symplectic integrator that easily computes geodesics and their bifurcations.
Finally, we study the periodic pitchfork bifurcation, a codimension-1
bifurcation arising in integrable Hamiltonian systems. It is not preserved by
either symplectic on nonsymplectic integrators, but in some circumstances
symplecticity greatly reduces the error.

agents bet on the optimal energy to put in place in order to climb on the
Bandwagon? In this paper we study the collective behavior of a large population
of agents being either Left or Right: the core idea is that agents benefit from
being with the winner party, but, on the other hand, they suffer a cost in
changing their status quo. At the microscopic level the model is formulated as
a stochastic, symmetric dynamic game with $N$ players. In the macroscopic limit
as $N \rightarrow +\infty$, we obtain a mean field game whose equilibria
describe the ""rational"" collective behavior of the society. It is of particular
interest to detect the emerging long-time attractors, e.g. consensus or
oscillating behavior. Significantly, we discover that bandwagoning can be
persistent at the macro level: endogenously generated periodicity is in fact
detected.

paper, we develop an approach to provide an effective solution to this problem.
We propose a method to train a geo-spatial deep neural network (CNN+LSTM) to
predict accurate geo-locations (latitude and longitude) using only ordinary
ground imagery and low accuracy phone-grade GPS. We evaluate our approach on
the open dataset released during ACM Multimedia 2017 Grand Challenge. Having
ground truth locations for training, we are able to reach nearly lane-level

San Francisco downtown area often described as ""downtown canyon"" where consumer
GPS signals are extremely inaccurate. The results show the model can predict
quality locations that suffice in real business applications, such as
ride-sharing, only using phone-grade GPS. Unlike classic visual localization or
recent PoseNet-like methods that may work well in indoor environments or
small-scale outdoor environments, we avoid using a map or an SFM

be scaled up without concerns over the potential failure of 3D reconstruction.

Power-Zineau-Woolley picture and the Poincar{\'e} gauge from the very first

  In a recent paper [2], we have shown that the Power-Zienau-Woolley
Hamiltonian does not derived from the minimal-coupling hamiltonian with the
help of a gauge transformation. This result has been challenged by G.
K{\'o}nya, al. in a comment 1 where the authors claim the equivalence between
the Power-Zienau-Woolley hamiltonian and the minimal-coupling hamiltonian in
the Poincar{\'e} gauge. They claim that we have made one error and one wrong
emphasis in our paper: The error as summarized by G. K{\'o}nya al. would be:
""The canonical field momentum is not gauge invariant. Equivalent
transformations of the Lagrangian do change the momentum. In field theories,
gauge transformations are special cases of such transformations. The electric
field E is gauge invariant, but its capacity of being the canonical momentum is
not. "" The wrong emphasis as summarized by G.K{\'o}nya al. would be: ""The use
of the canonical coordinate/momentum pair A p and E in Poincar{\'e} gauge is
presented as mandatory in Rousseau and Felbacq paper, whereas as there is a
certain freedom of choice in selecting this pair. Also in Poincar{\'e} gauge it
is possible to use A c as canonical coordinate, in which case the conjugate
momentum will be D. This is the most convenient choice in terms of the set of
nontrivial Dirac brackets. Cf. Table 1 in G. K{\'o}nya al. paper 1 for possible
choices.""
  We do not share these conclusions and show in this reply that these
statements are incorrect. Specifically, we show that under a gauge
transformation, the canonical momentum $\pi$(x,t) conjugated to the vector
potential A(x,t) is given by $\pi$(x,t) = --$\epsilon$\_0 E(x,t). This happens
because the Lagrangian does not contains terms proportional to $\partial$\_t
$\phi$ (x,t) where $\phi$ (x,t) is the scalar potential. Moreover our choice of
canonical variables was challenged. Actually, our set of independent variables
is exactly the same as in G. K{\'o}nya al. except that we do not write
explicitly the dependent variables in term of the independent ones. This is one
great advantage of the Dirac procedure for constrained hamiltonian.

this temporal network model, agents are endowed with an intrinsic activity $a$,
ruling the rate at which they generate connections, and an intrinsic
attractiveness $b$, modulating the rate at which they receive connections. The
consensus dynamics considered is a mixed voter/Moran dynamics. Each agent,
either in state $0$ or $1$, modifies his/her state when connecting with a peer.
Thus, an active agent copies his/her state from the peer (with probability $p$)
or imposes his/her state to him/her (with the complementary probability $1-p$).
Applying a heterogeneous mean-field approach, we derive a differential equation
for the average density of voters with activity $a$ and attractiveness $b$ in
state $1$, that we use to evaluate the average time to reach consensus and the
exit probability, defined as the probability that a single agent with activity
$a$ and attractiveness $b$ eventually imposes his/her state to a pool of
initially unanimous population in the opposite state. We study a number of

the Yukawa coupling matrices are expected to be hermitian. In this model,
several Higgs doublets are introduced to realize the realistic fermion mass
matrices, and the heavy Higgs doublets have flavor changing couplings with
quarks and leptons. The LR symmetry is assumed to break down at high energy to
realize the Type-I seesaw mechanism. The supersymmetry breaking scale is
expected to be around 100 TeV to achieve the 125 GeV Higgs. In such a setup,
the flavor-dependent interaction of the Higgs fields becomes sizable, so that
we especially discuss the flavor physics induced by the heavy Higgs fields in
our work. Our prediction depends on the structure of neutrinos, e.g., the
neutrino mass ordering. We demonstrate how the flavor structure of the SM
affects the flavor violating couplings. In our analysis, we mainly focus on the
four-fermi interaction induced by the scalar exchanging, and we propose a
simple parameterization for the coefficients. Then, we find the correlations
among the flavor observables and, for instance, see that our prediction for the

combining observations with a physical model. When sequential data assimilation
is considered, the joint distribution of the latent state and the observations
is described mathematically using a state-space model, and filtering or
smoothing algorithms are used to approximate the conditional distribution of
the state given the observations. The most popular algorithms in the data
assimilation community are based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter and Smoother
(EnKF/EnKS) and its extensions. In this paper we investigate an alternative
approach where a Conditional Particle Filter (CPF) is combined with Backward
Simulation (BS). This allows to explore efficiently the latent space and
simulate quickly relevant trajectories of the state conditionally to the
observations. We also tackle the difficult problem of parameter estimation.
Indeed, the models generally involve statistical parameters in the physical
models and/or in the stochastic models for the errors. These parameters
strongly impact the results of the data assimilation algorithm and there is a
need for an efficient method to estimate them. Expectation-Maximization (EM) is
the most classical algorithm in the statistical literature to estimate the
parameters in models with latent variables. It consists in updating
sequentially the parameters by maximizing a likelihood function where the state
is approximated using a smoothing algorithm. In this paper, we propose an
original Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm combined to the
CPF-BS smoother to estimate the statistical parameters. We show on several toy
models that this algorithm provides, with reasonable computational cost,
accurate estimations of the statistical parameters and the state in highly
nonlinear state-space models, where the application of EM algorithms using EnKS
is limited. We also provide a Python source code of the algorithm.

new routine for designing high-performance nanoelectronic devices. To
facilitate the device applications, there are three key requirements for a
material: sizeable band gap, high carrier mobility and robust environmental
stability. However, for the hottest 2D materials studied in recent years,
graphene is gapless, transition metal dichalcogenides have low carrier
mobility, and black phosphorene is environmentally sensitive. So far, these
three characteristics can seldom be satisfied in one single material.
Therefore, it becomes a great challenge for finding an ideal 2D material to
overcome such a limitation. In this work, we theoretically predict a novel
planar 2D material: Penta-Pt2N4, which are designed by the fantastic Cario
pentagonal tiling as well as the rare nitrogen double bond. Most significantly,
the 2D Penta-Pt2N4 exhibits excellent intrinsic properties, including large
direct band gap up to 1.51 eV, high carrier mobility up to 105 cm2V-1s-1, giant
Young's module up to 0.70 TPa, and robust dynamic, thermal and chemical
stability. Moreover, Penta-Pt2N4 is a global minimal with PtN2 stoichiometry in
2D, so we also propose a CVD/MBE scheme to enable its experimental synthesis.
We envision that the 2D Penta-Pt2N4 may find a wide application for future
nanoelectronics.

missions like Kepler and K2 has created the need for automated asteroseismic

identify which stars show oscillations. It is critical that this step can be
performed with no, or little, detection bias, particularly when performing
subsequent ensemble analyses that aim to compare properties of observed stellar
populations with those from galactic models. Yet, an efficient, automated
solution to this initial detection step has still not been found, meaning that
expert visual inspection of data from each star is required to obtain the
highest level of detections. Hence, to mimic how an expert eye analyses the
data, we use supervised deep learning to not only detect oscillations in red
giants, but also predict the location of the frequency at maximum power,
$\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, by observing features in 2D images of power spectra. By
training on Kepler data, we benchmark our deep learning classifier against K2
data that are given detections by the expert eye, achieving a detection
accuracy of 98% on K2 Campaign 6 stars and a detection accuracy of 99% on K2
Campaign 3 stars. We further find that the estimated uncertainty of our deep
learning-based $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ predictions is about 5%. This is comparable
to human-level performance using visual inspection. When examining outliers we
find that the deep learning results are more likely to provide robust
$\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ estimates than the classical model-fitting method.

the reflected or transmitted light for an angle of scattering which depends on
the angle of incidence. We also describe a generalization of the Brewster
scattering phenomenon for outgoing evanescent waves and circularly-polarized
waves. The physical mechanisms responsible for these phenomena are described in
terms of simple notions such as scalar waves, oscillating and rotating dipoles
and geometrical arguments, and are valid in a regime of weakly rough
interfaces.

high--order flow solver combined with both a standard and a novel dynamic
implicit spectral vanishing viscosity (iSVV and dynamic iSVV) model to account
for subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses. The numerical solutions are compared against
wind tunnel measurements, which include mean velocity and turbulent intensity
profiles, as well as integral rotor quantities such as power and thrust
coefficients. For the standard (also termed static) case the magnitude of the
spectral vanishing viscosity is selected via a heuristic analysis of the wake
statistics, while in the case of the dynamic model the magnitude is adjusted
both in space and time at each time step. The study focuses on examining the
ability of the two approaches, standard (static) and dynamic, to accurately
capture the wake features, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results
suggest that the static method can become over-dissipative when the magnitude
of the spectral viscosity is increased, while the dynamic approach which
adjusts the magnitude of dissipation locally is shown to be more appropriate
for a non-homogeneous flow such that of a wind turbine wake.

transition region temperatures have been difficult to interpret. However,
realistic three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics (3D rMHD) models of
the solar atmosphere are able to reproduce the observed dominant line shifts
and may thus hold the key to resolve these issues. Our new 3D rMHD simulations
aim to shed light on how mass flows between the chromosphere and corona and on
how the coronal mass is maintained. Passive tracer particles, so-called corks,
allow the tracking of parcels of plasma over time and thus the study of changes
in plasma temperature and velocity not only locally, but also in a co-moving
frame. By following the trajectories of the corks, we can investigate mass and
energy flows and understand the composition of the observed velocities. Our
findings show that most of the transition region mass is cooling. The
preponderance of transition region redshifts in the model can be explained by
the higher percentage of downflowing mass in the lower and middle transition
region. The average upflows in the upper transition region can be explained by
a combination of both stronger upflows than downflows and a higher percentage
of upflowing mass. The most common combination at lower and middle transition
region temperatures are corks that are cooling and traveling downward. For
these corks, a strong correlation between the pressure gradient along the
magnetic field line and the velocity along the magnetic field line has been
observed, indicating a formation mechanism that is related to downward
propagating pressure disturbances. Corks at upper transition region
temperatures are subject to a rather slow and highly variable but continuous
heating process.

Nonlinear superhorizon perturbation including both scalar (curvature
perturbation) and tensor (gravitational waves) modes can be dealt with valid up
to a second-order in the expansion. First we will review the formalism for a
standard general relativity (GR) gravity plus a general kinetic single scalar
(k-inflation) with a general form of the potential in the context of
inflationary cosmology. That is the basic overview of our procedure. Then it
can be extended to more general framework, that is (1) beyond k-inflation

term and a general form of the potential and also (3) beyond Einstein gravity
(general scalar-tensor theory), which can lead to several kinds of modified

dark energy. We provide a formalism to obtain the solution and construct
nonlinear curvature perturbation in such general theoretical situation and it

low-rank reconstructions. First, a more flexible subspace iteration algorithm
is presented that works for any views $v \geq 2$, instead of only allowing an
even $v$. Secondly, we propose more general and more accurate single-pass
algorithms. In particular, we propose a more accurate memory efficient
single-pass method and a more general single-pass algorithm which, unlike
previous methods, does not require prior information to assure near peak
performance. Thirdly, combining ideas from subspace and single-pass algorithms,
we present a more pass-efficient randomized block Krylov algorithm, which can
achieve a desired accuracy using considerably fewer views than that needed by a
subspace or previously studied block Krylov methods. However, the proposed
accuracy enhanced block Krylov method is restricted to large matrices that are
either accessed a few columns or rows at a time. Recommendations are also given
on how to apply the subspace and block Krylov algorithms when estimating either
the dominant left or right singular subspace of a matrix, or when estimating a
normal matrix, such as those appearing in inverse problems. Computational
experiments are carried out that demonstrate the applicability and

the direction of Tuc-II. The fact that a very weak significant $\gamma$-ray
excess ($2.2\sigma$) over the background of Tuc-II have been detected from the

parameter quenches. With the aid of iterated equations of motion in combination
with a suitable scalar product for operators we describe the dynamics and the
long-term behavior in particular of the system after interaction quenches. This
becomes possible because the employed approximation allows for oscillatory
dynamics avoiding spurious divergences. The infinite-time behavior is captured
by an analytical approach based on stationary phases; no numerical averages
over long times need to be computed. We study the most relevant frequencies in
the dynamics after the quench and find that the local interaction $U$ as well
as the band width $W$ dominate. In contrast to former studies a crossover
instead of a sharp dynamical transition depending on the strength of the quench
is identified. For weak quenches the band width is more important while for
strong quenches the local interaction $U$ dominates.

The approach significantly reduces uncertainty in the parameterization of
stochastic numerical studies on the effects of defects. To demonstrate our
methodology, we present an original stochastic study to determine the
distribution of strength of corner bend samples with random out-plane wrinkle
defects. The defects are parameterized by stochastic random fields defined
using Karhunen-Lo\'{e}ve (KL) modes. The distribution of KL coefficients are
inferred from misalignment data extracted from B-Scan data using a modified
version of Multiple Field Image Analysis. The strength distribution is
estimated, by embedding wrinkles into high fidelity FE simulations using the
high performance toolbox 'dune-composites' from which we observe severe
knockdowns of $74\%$ with a probability of $1/200$. Supported by the literature
our results highlight the strong correlation between maximum misalignment and
knockdown in coupon strength. This observations allows us to define a surrogate
model providing fast assessment of predicted strength informed from stochastic
simulations utilizing both observed wrinkle data and high fidelity finite

  Existing studies on specialty-aware spatial crowdsourcing assume that each

fuel cost and investment cost. Optimal production capacities are installed
choosing from a range of well-established production and storage technologies
including boilers, combined heat and power (CHP) units, power-to-heat
technologies and heat storages. The optimal heat production system is
characterized in three different electricity pricing scenarios: Historical,
wind power dominated and demand dominated. Coal CHP, large heat pumps and heat
storages dominate the optimal system if fossil fuels are allowed. Heat pumps
and storages take over if fossil fuels are excluded. The capacity allocation
between CHP and heat pumps is highly dependent on cost assumptions in the
fossil fuel scenario, but the optimal capacities become much more robust if
fossil fuels are not included. System cost becomes less robust in a fossil free
scenario. If the electricity pricing is dominated by wind power generation or
by the electricity demand, heat pumps become more favorable compared to
cogeneration units. The need for heat storage more than doubles, if fossil
fuels are not included, as the heating system becomes more closely coupled to
the electricity system.

approximated by a hierarchy of convex, finite-dimensional, semidefinite

solutions to these SDPs provide bounds on a specified, possibly nonlinear,
functional of the solutions to the PDE; in the case of PDE control, the
solutions to these SDPs provide bounds on the optimal value of a given optimal

  poroelasticity",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present and analyze a new mixed finite element formulation
of a general family of quasi-static multiple-network poroelasticity (MPET)
equations. The MPET equations describe flow and deformation in an elastic
porous medium that is permeated by multiple fluid networks of differing
characteristics. As such, the MPET equations represent a generalization of
Biot's equations, and numerical discretizations of the MPET equations face
similar challenges. Here, we focus on the nearly incompressible case for which
standard mixed finite element discretizations of the MPET equations perform
poorly. Instead, we propose a new mixed finite element formulation based on
introducing an additional total pressure variable. By presenting energy
estimates for the continuous solutions and a priori error estimates for a
family of compatible semi-discretizations, we show that this formulation is
robust in the limits of incompressibility, vanishing storage coefficients, and
vanishing transfer between networks. These theoretical results are corroborated
by numerical experiments. Our primary interest in the MPET equations stems from
the use of these equations in modelling interactions between biological fluids
and tissues in physiological settings. So, we additionally present
physiologically realistic numerical results for blood and tissue fluid flow
interactions in the human brain.

  Workshop on the Economics of Networks, Systems and Computation (NetEcon'19)",,,,"cs.DC cs.GT cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud computing providers face the problem of matching heterogeneous customer
workloads to resources that will serve them. This is particularly challenging
if customers, who are already running a job on a cluster, scale their resource
usage up and down over time. The provider therefore has to continuously decide
whether she can add additional workloads to a given cluster or if doing so
would impact existing workloads' ability to scale. Currently, this is often
done using simple threshold policies to reserve large parts of each cluster,
which leads to low efficiency (i.e., low average utilization of the cluster).
We propose more sophisticated policies for controlling admission to a cluster
and demonstrate that they significantly increase cluster utilization. We first
introduce the cluster admission problem and formalize it as a constrained
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). As it is infeasible to
solve the POMDP optimally, we then systematically design admission policies
that estimate moments of each workload's distribution of future resource usage.
Via extensive simulations grounded in a trace from Microsoft Azure, we show
that our admission policies lead to a substantial improvement over the simple
threshold policy. We then show that substantial further gains are possible if
high-quality information is available about arriving workloads. Based on this,
we propose an information elicitation approach to incentivize users to provide
this information and simulate its effects.

\emph{persistent} comparison errors. In this model (Braverman and Mossel,
SODA'08), each comparison between two elements can be wrong with some fixed
(small) probability $p$, and \emph{comparisons cannot be repeated}. Sorting
perfectly in this model is impossible, and the objective is to minimize the
\emph{dislocation} of each element in the output sequence, that is, the
difference between its true rank and its position. Existing lower bounds for
this problem show that no algorithm can guarantee, with high probability,
\emph{maximum dislocation} and \emph{total dislocation} better than
$\Omega(\log n)$ and $\Omega(n)$, respectively, regardless of its running time.
  In this paper, we present the first \emph{$O(n\log n)$-time} sorting
algorithm that guarantees both \emph{$O(\log n)$ maximum dislocation} and
\emph{$O(n)$ total dislocation} with high probability. Besides improving over
the previous state-of-the art algorithms -- the best known algorithm had
running time $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ -- our result indicates that comparison
errors do not make the problem computationally more difficult: a sequence with
the best possible dislocation can be obtained in $O(n\log n)$ time and, even
without comparison errors, $\Omega(n\log n)$ time is necessary to guarantee
such dislocation bounds.
  In order to achieve this optimal result, we solve two sub-problems, and the
respective methods have their own merits for further application. One is how to
locate a position in which to insert an element in an almost-sorted sequence
having $O(\log n)$ maximum dislocation in such a way that the dislocation of
the resulting sequence will still be $O(\log n)$. The other is how to
simultaneously insert $m$ elements into an almost sorted sequence of $m$
different elements, such that the resulting sequence of $2m$ elements remains
almost sorted.

formulation engineering, we have designed an efficient Dynamic Monte Carlo
(DMC) approach to mimic their out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Our recent theory,
which provided a rigorous method to reproduce the Brownian motion of colloids
by MC simulations, is here generalised to reproduce the Brownian motion of
colloidal particles during transitory unsteady states, when their thermodynamic
equilibrium is significantly modified. To this end, we investigate monodisperse
and bidisperse rod-like particles in the isotropic phase and apply an external
field that forces their reorientation along a common direction and induces an
isotropic-to-nematic phase transition. We also study the behaviour of the
system once the external field is removed. Our simulations are in excellent
quantitative agreement with Brownian Dynamics simulations when the DMC results
are rescaled with a time-dependent acceptance ratio, which depends on the
strength of the applied field. Further generalising our DMC algorithm to
processes displaying significant density fluctuations, such as nucleation and
growth, where the MC acceptance ratio is expected to depend on both time and

motion are strong functions of the wetting characteristics and geometric
parameters of the patterned ribs. Modulation of these parameters alters the
surface energy over the rib surface, which, in turn, facilitates the
interaction between interfacial tension and driving electrothermal forces. The
competition between two forces may speed up or slow down the fluid-fluid-solid
contact line motion over the rib surface. At the edges of the ribs, the
interface can halt for a sufficiently long time owing to contact line pinning.
Alteration in positions of the rib between the electrode pairs changes the
electric field strength and thereby bulk ACET forces across the contact line.
Further, by suitable arrangement of the ribs, various intricate shapes of the
liquid front can be achieved over a short distance, which can have significant
implications in the morphological control of microscale flows.

formation process. By following the magnetic field of their environment and
interacting with neutral species, they slow down the gravitational collapse of
the proto-star envelope. This process (known as ambipolar diffusion) depends on
the ionisation degree, which can be derived from the \hco abundance. We present
a study of \hco and its isotopologues (H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HC$^{18}$O$^+$, DCO$^+$,
and H$^{13}$CO$^+$) in the low-mass proto-star IRAS16293$-$2422. The structure
of this object is complex, and the HCO$^+$ emission arises from the
contribution of a young NW-SE outflow, the proto-stellar envelope and the
foreground cloud. We aim at constraining the physical parameters of these
structures using all the observed transitions. For the young NW-SE outflow, we
derive $T_{\rm kin}=180-220$ K and $n({\rm H_2})=(4-7)\times10^6$ cm$^{-3}$
with an HCO$^+$ abundance of $(3-5)\times10^{-9}$. Following previous studies,
we demonstrate that the presence of a cold ($T_{\rm kin}$$\leqslant$30 K) and
low density ($n({\rm H_2})\leqslant1\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) foreground cloud is
also necessary to reproduce the observed line profiles. We have used the
gas-grain chemical code \textsc{nautilus} to derive the HCO$^+$ abundance
profile across the envelope and the external regions where
X(HCO$^+$)$\gtrsim1\times10^{-9}$ dominate the envelope emission. From this, we
derive an ionisation degree of
$10^{-8.9}\,\lesssim\,x(e)\,\lesssim\,10^{-7.9}$. The ambipolar diffusion
timescale is $\sim$5 times the free-fall timescale, indicating that the
magnetic field starts to support the source against gravitational collapse and
the magnetic field strength is estimated to be $6-46 \mu$G.

different theoretical approaches reported significant radiative energy loss of
high $p_{\perp}$ partons, thereby questioning its validity. To address this
issue, we relaxed the soft-gluon approximation within DGLV formalism. The
obtained analytical expressions are quite distinct compared to the soft-gluon

energy loss lead to small differences in predictions for the two cases. The
difference in the predicted number of radiated gluons is also small. Moreover,
the effect on these two variables has an opposite sign, which when combined
results in almost overlapping suppression predictions. Therefore, our results
imply that, contrary to the commonly held doubts, the soft-gluon approximation
in practice works surprisingly well in DGLV formalism. Finally, we also discuss
generalizing this relaxation in the dynamical QCD medium, which suggests a more
general applicability of the conclusions obtained here.

models in which the Amontons-Coulomb friction laws yield a linear programming
(LP) problem for the tensions in the fiber elements. We find there is a
percolation transition such that above the percolation threshold the
transmitted tension is in principle unbounded, We determine that the mean slack
in the LP constraints is a suitable order parameter to characterize this
supercritical state. We argue the mechanism is generic, and in practical terms
corresponds to a switch from a ductile to a brittle failure mode accompanied by
a significant increase in mechanical strength.

stochastic gradient optimization. While the use of large mini-batches increases
the available computational parallelism, small batch training has been shown to
provide improved generalization performance and allows a significantly smaller
memory footprint, which might also be exploited to improve machine throughput.
  In this paper, we review common assumptions on learning rate scaling and
training duration, as a basis for an experimental comparison of test
performance for different mini-batch sizes. We adopt a learning rate that
corresponds to a constant average weight update per gradient calculation (i.e.,
per unit cost of computation), and point out that this results in a variance of
the weight updates that increases linearly with the mini-batch size $m$.
  The collected experimental results for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
datasets show that increasing the mini-batch size progressively reduces the
range of learning rates that provide stable convergence and acceptable test
performance. On the other hand, small mini-batch sizes provide more up-to-date
gradient calculations, which yields more stable and reliable training. The best
performance has been consistently obtained for mini-batch sizes between $m = 2$
and $m = 32$, which contrasts with recent work advocating the use of mini-batch
sizes in the thousands.

signature of an antiferromagnetic ordering at very low temperature. The
experimentally observed structural and magnetic properties are found to be
significantly different from the theoretically predicted properties of the
ordered cubic C1b structure. To probe the possible disorder present in the
system and its effect on the magnetic properties, we have carried out first
principles calculations using the spin-polarized-relativistic
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method (SPR-KKR). Using a combination of XRD,
photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetization measurements and first principles
calculations, we conclude that NiCrGa has significant amount of atomic
disorder. Although, the ordered structure is energetically more stable than the
disordered structures, we find that after synthesis, the system tends to
stabilize in a disordered structure. With this atomic disorder present in the

many commonalities with Rosenbluth sampling for chain macromolecules, including
practical problems which stem from the fact that both are iterated importance
sampling schemes: for long trajectories the distribution of trajectory weights
becomes very broad and trajectories carrying high weights are infrequently
sampled, yet long trajectories are unavoidable in rugged landscapes. For
probing the probability landscapes of genetic switches and similar systems,
these issues preclude the straightforward use of trajectory reweighting. The

introduced by Senoguz and Shafi in [1], for $SU(5)$ and flipped $SU(5)$ models

$U(1)_R \times Z_{n}$ symmetry for its successful implementation. The standard
model (SM) gauge singlet scalar components of $24_H$ and $10_H$ GUT Higgs
superfields are respectively employed to realize successful inflation in
$SU(5)$ and flipped $SU(5)$ models. The predictions of the various inflationary
observables lie within the recent Planck bounds on the scalar spectral index,
$n_s$, for $n \geq 5$ in $SU(5)$ model and for $n \geq 6$ in flipped $SU(5)$
model. In particular, the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ and the running of
spectral index $d n_s/ d\ln k$ are negligibly small and lie in the range,
$10^{-12} \lesssim r \lesssim 10^{-8}$ and $10^{-9} \lesssim dn_s/d\ln k
\lesssim 10^{-3}$, for realistic values of $n$. In numerical estimation of the
various predictions, we fix the gauge symmetry breaking scale, $M$, around $2
\times 10^{16}$ GeV. The issue of gauge coupling unification in $R$-symmetric
$SU(5)$ is evaded by adding vectorlike families with mass splitting within
their multiplets. The dilution of monopoles beyond the observable limit is
naturally achieved in the breaking of $SU(5)$ gauge symmetry during inflation.
A realistic scenario of reheating with non-thermal leptogenesis is employed for
both models. The predicted range of reheat temperature within Planck bounds, $3
\times 10^{7}\text{ GeV }\lesssim T_r \lesssim 2 \times 10^{9}$ GeV, is safe
from the gravitino problem for the gravitino mass, $m_{3/2} \gtrsim 10$ TeV.
Finally, the $U(1)_R \times Z_{n}$ symmetry is also observed to play a crucial
role in suppressing the various fast proton decay operators.

patching is required). Experiments on shape partitioning are conducted to
validate the performance of the proposed compact support basis.

background configuration and a dynamical perturbation. In gauge theories, the
situation is complicated by the fact that a covariant (w.r.t. the background
field) gauge fixing breaks this split independence of the action. Nevertheless,
background independence is preserved on the observables, as defined via the
BRST formalism, since the violation term is BRST exact. In quantized gauge
theories, however, BRST exactness of the violation term is not sufficient to
guarantee background independence, due to potential anomalies. We define
background independent observables in a geometrical formulation as flat
sections of the observable algebra bundle over the manifold of background
configurations, with respect to a flat connection which implements background
variations. A theory is then called background independent if such a flat
(Fedosov) connection exists. We analyze the obstructions to preserve background
independence at the quantum level for pure Yang-Mills theory and for
perturbative gravity. We find that in the former case all potential
obstructions can be removed by finite renormalization. In the latter case, as a
consequence of power-counting non-renormalizability, there are infinitely many
non-trivial potential obstructions to background independence. We leave open
the question whether these obstructions actually occur.

the following two content reception strategies: the sequential reception for
uncoded caching and the random reception for maximum distance separable

the uncoded caching and the MDS-coded caching strategies by identifying the

cyber defense should involve extensive use of partially autonomous agents that
actively patrol the friendly network, and detect and react to hostile
activities rapidly (far faster than human reaction time), before the hostile
malware is able to inflict major damage, evade friendly agents, or destroy
friendly agents. This requires cyber-defense agents with a significant degree
of intelligence, autonomy, self-learning, and adaptability. The report focuses
on the following questions: In what computing and tactical environments would
such an agent operate? What data would be available for the agent to observe or
ingest? What actions would the agent be able to take? How would such an agent
plan a complex course of actions? Would the agent learn from its experiences,
and how? How would the agent collaborate with humans? How can we ensure that
the agent will not take undesirable destructive actions? Is it possible to help
envision such an agent with a simple example?

values, treating them as ""not a number"", at a loss of possibly useful
qualitative information.
  The current work focuses on the development of a data assimilation scheme
that tackles observations with a detection limit. We present the Ensemble
Kalman Filter Semi-Qualitative (EnKF-SQ) and test its performance against the
Partial Deterministic Ensemble Kalman Filter (PDEnKF) of Borup et al. (2015).
Both are designed to explicitly assimilate the out-of-range observations: the
out-of-range values are qualitative by nature (inequalities), but one can
postulate a probability distribution for them and then update the ensemble
members accordingly. The EnKF-SQ is tested within the framework of twin
experiments, using both linear and non-linear toy models. Different sensitivity
experiments are conducted to assess the influence of the ensemble size,
observation detection limit and a number of observations on the performance of
the filter. Our numerical results show that assimilating qualitative
observations using the proposed scheme improves the overall forecast mean,
making it viable for testing on more realistic applications such as sea-ice
models.

spectrometers. The measured electron energy distribution was in a good
agreement with results of Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. Analysis of the
bremsstrahlung spectra and results on measurements of the run-away electrons
showed a suppression of the hot electrons production in the case of the high
laser contrast. By application of Ti-foils covered with nm-thin Fe-layers we
demonstrated that the thickness of the created keV hot dense plasma does not
exceed 150 nm. Results of the pilot hydro-dynamic simulations that are based on
a wide-range two-temperature EOS, wide-range description of all transport and
optical properties, ionization, electron and radiative heating, plasma
expansion, and Maxwell equations (with a wide-range permittivity) for

absorption in plasmas with a near solid step-like electron density profile. The
laser energy firstly deposited into the nm-thin skin-layer is then transported
into the target depth by the electron heat conductivity. This scenario is
opposite to the volumetric character of the energy deposition produced by

anticipation and prevention of all possible attacks and malfunctions are not
feasible for the current or future systems comprising the cyber infrastructure.
Therefore, interest in cyber resilience (as opposed to merely risk-based
approaches) is increasing rapidly, in literature and in practice. Unlike
concepts of risk or robustness - which are often and incorrectly conflated with
resilience - resiliency refers to the system's ability to recover or regenerate
its performance to a sufficient level after an unexpected impact produces a
degradation of its performance. The exact relation among resilience, risk, and
robustness has not been well articulated technically. The presentations and
discussions at the workshop yielded this report. It focuses on the following
topics that the participants of the workshop saw as particularly important:
fundamental properties of cyber resilience; approaches to measuring and
modeling cyber resilience; mission modeling for cyber resilience; systems
engineering for cyber resilience, and dynamic defense as a path toward cyber
resilience.

$S_n$ confirms the principle of detailed balance. Thus, a complete $\gamma$SF
is established covering in total the energy region of 1 MeV $\leq$ E$_{\gamma}$
$\leq$ 13 MeV. These mid-shell well-deformed dysprosium isotopes all show
scissors resonances with very similar structures. We find that our data predict
the same integrated scissors strength as ($\gamma,\gamma^\prime$) data when
integrated over the same energy range, which shows that the scissors mode very
likely is consistent with the generalized Brink hypothesis. Finally, using the
$\gamma$SFs as input in the reaction code TALYS, we have deduced radiative
neutron-capture cross sections and compared them to direct measurements. We
find a very good agreement within the uncertainties, which gives further
support to the experimentally determined $\gamma$SFs.

lead to greater robustness, higher performance and increased problem-solving
ability in a broad range of studies that includes insect groups, human groups

within Evolutionary Robotics, requiring reproductive isolation and careful
attention to population size and selection mechanisms. To tackle this issue, we
introduce a novel, decentralised, variant of the MAP-Elites illumination
algorithm which is hybridised with a well-known distributed evolutionary
algorithm (mEDEA). The algorithm simultaneously evolves multiple diverse
behaviours for multiple robots, with respect to a simple token-gathering task.
Each robot in the swarm maintains a local archive defined by two pre-specified
functional traits which is shared with robots it come into contact with. We
investigate four different strategies for sharing, exploiting and combining
local archives and compare results to mEDEA. Experimental results show that in
contrast to previous claims, it is possible to evolve a functionally diverse
swarm without geographical isolation, and that the new method outperforms mEDEA
in terms of the diversity, coverage and precision of the evolved swarm.

the blockchain, Bitcoin offers new opportunities both for developed and
developing countries. Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the
banking system, thus facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees
such as remittances, with a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities
together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and
made its price skyrocket during 2017. However, while the Bitcoin blockchain
attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this
attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and
consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to
characterize the adoption of the bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first
part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software
client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and
the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the
system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for
user adoption, we identified several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per
capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables
correlated with the degree of user adoption. In the second part of the work, we
build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP
addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of
the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked
to the flow of bitcoins between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a
new insight on the bitcoin adoption by country and on the potential
socio-economic drivers of the international bitcoin flow.

dense planetary rings.
  Already by Goldreich & Tremaine (1978) it has been argued that density waves
might be unstable, depending on the relationship between the ring's viscosity
and the surface mass density.
  In the recent paper Schmidt et al. (2016) we have pointed out that when -
within a fluid description of the ring dynamics - the criterion for viscous
overstability is satisfied, forced spiral density waves become unstable as
well.
  In this case, linear theory fails to describe the damping, but nonlinearity
of the underlying equations guarantees a finite amplitude and eventually a
damping of the wave.
  We apply the multiple scale formalism to derive a weakly nonlinear damping
relation from a hydrodynamical model.
  This relation describes the resonant excitation and nonlinear viscous damping
of spiral density waves in a vertically integrated fluid disk with density
dependent transport coefficients.
  The model consistently predicts density waves to be (linearly) unstable in a
ring region where the conditions for viscous overstability are met.
  Sufficiently far away from the Lindblad resonance, the surface mass density
perturbation is predicted to saturate to a constant value due to nonlinear
viscous damping.
  The wave's damping lengths of the model depend on certain input parameters,
such as the distance to the threshold for viscous overstability in parameter
space and the ground state surface mass density.

learning the generator we consider the content-related loss and the generative
adversarial regularizer jointly to improve the stability and the robustness of
the generated HDR images. Using the learned generator as the proposed inverse

Here, we explore under which conditions a nudging protocol can be used for two
novel objectives: to unravel the value of the physical flow parameters and to
reconstruct large-scale turbulent properties starting from a sparse set of
information in space and in time. First, we apply nudging to quantitatively
infer the unknown rotation rate and the shear mechanism for turbulent flows.
Second, we show that a suitable spectral nudging is able to reconstruct the
energy containing scales in rotating turbulence by using a blind set-up, i.e.
without any input about the external forcing mechanisms acting on the flow.
Finally, we discuss the broad potentialities of nudging to other key
applications for physics-informed data-assimilation in environmental or applied

interplay between symmetries, conservation laws and the phase space of the

forms and both differential forms on space-time and differential forms on the
infinite dimensional space of solutions of the equations of motion of the field
theory play an important role. There are exterior derivatives on both spaces

the study of quantum anomalies in gauge theories.
  We derive the structure of this double complex and show how it relates to
conserved quantities in gravitational theories. One consequence of the
construction is that conserved quantities can be calculated exactly at finite
distance --- for example it is not necessary to go to asymptotic regimes to
calculate the mass or angular momentum of a stationary solution of Einstein's
equations, they can be obtained exactly by an integration over any sphere
outside the mass even at finite radius.

in data distributions between train (source domain) and test (target domain)
sets used to build and evaluate the models. This is a common problem, as
multiple studies have shown that the performance of emotional classifiers drop
when they are exposed to data that does not match the distribution used to
build the emotion classifiers. The difference in data distributions becomes
very clear when the training and testing data come from different domains,
causing a large performance gap between validation and testing performance. Due
to the high cost of annotating new data and the abundance of unlabeled data, it
is crucial to extract as much useful information as possible from the available
unlabeled data. This study looks into the use of adversarial multitask training
to extract a common representation between train and test domains. The primary
task is to predict emotional attribute-based descriptors for arousal, valence,
or dominance. The secondary task is to learn a common representation where the
train and test domains cannot be distinguished. By using a gradient reversal
layer, the gradients coming from the domain classifier are used to bring the
source and target domain representations closer. We show that exploiting
unlabeled data consistently leads to better emotion recognition performance
across all emotional dimensions. We visualize the effect of adversarial
training on the feature representation across the proposed deep learning
architecture. The analysis shows that the data representations for the train
and test domains converge as the data is passed to deeper layers of the
network. We also evaluate the difference in performance when we use a shallow
neural network versus a \emph{deep neural network} (DNN) and the effect of the
number of shared layers used by the task and domain classifiers.

a slot mapping matrix based on human heuristics. However, existing dialogue
policy transfer methods cannot transfer across dialogue domains with different
speech-acts, for example, between systems built by different companies. Also,
they depend on either common slots or slot entropy, which are not available
when the source and target slots are totally disjoint and no database is
available to calculate the slot entropy. To solve this problem, we propose a
Policy tRansfer across dOMaIns and SpEech-acts (PROMISE) model, which is able
to transfer dialogue policies across domains with different speech-acts and
disjoint slots. The PROMISE model can learn to align different speech-acts and

attention as a result of their diverse applications. In its simple form, a
combinatorial strategy can reduce several input parameters (configurations) of
a system into a small set based on their interaction (or combination). In
practice, the input configurations of software systems are subjected to
constraints, especially in case of highly configurable systems. To implement
this feature within a strategy, many difficulties arise for construction. While
there are many combinatorial interaction testing strategies nowadays, few of
them support constraints. Objective: This paper presents a new strategy, to
construct combinatorial interaction test suites in the presence of constraints.
Method: The design and algorithms are provided in detail. To overcome the
multi-judgment criteria for an optimal solution, the multi-objective particle
swarm optimization and multithreading are used. The strategy and its associated
algorithms are evaluated extensively using different benchmarks and
comparisons. Results: Our results are promising as the evaluation results
showed the efficiency and performance of each algorithm in the strategy. The
benchmarking results also showed that the strategy can generate constrained
test suites efficiently as compared to state-of-the-art strategies. Conclusion:
The proposed strategy can form a new way for constructing of constrained
combinatorial interaction test suites. The strategy can form a new and
effective base for future implementations.

effective method have not been found so far. In this short paper, we focus on
the robustness of the features learned by neural networks. We show that the
features learned by neural networks are not robust, and find that the
robustness of the learned features is closely related to the resistance against
adversarial examples of neural networks. We also find that adversarial training
against fast gradients sign method (FGSM) does not make the leaned features
very robust, even if it can make the trained networks very resistant to FGSM

  VR (Virtual Reality) replaces the real world with a simulated experience

Reality provides blends that interpolate between real and virtual worlds in
various proportions, along a ""Virtuality"" axis, and extrapolate to an ""X-axis"".
Mediated Reality goes a step further by mixing/blending and also modifying
reality. This modifying of reality introduces a second axis. Mediated Reality
is useful as a seeing aid (e.g. modifying reality to make it easier to

  We propose Multimediated Reality as a multidimensional multisensory mediated
reality that includes not just interactive multimedia-based reality for our
five senses, but also includes additional senses (like sensory sonar, sensory
radar, etc.), as well as our human actions/actuators. These extra senses are
mapped to our human senses using synthetic synesthesia. This allows us to
directly experience real (but otherwise invisible) phenomena, such as wave
propagation and wave interference patterns, so that we can see radio waves and
sound waves and how they interact with objects and each other. Multimediated
reality is multidimensional, multimodal, multisensory, and multiscale. It is
also multidisciplinary, in that we must consider not just the user, but also
how the technology affects others, e.g. how its physical appearance affects

We consider the COST 2100 channel model. In this paper, we first propose a new
user selection algorithm based on knowledge of the geometry of the service area
and of location of clusters, without having full channel state information
(CSI) at the BS. We then show that the correlation in geometry-based stochastic
channel models (GSCMs) arises from the common clusters in the area. In
addition, exploiting the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB)s, the
analysis for the robustness of the proposed scheme to cluster position errors
is presented. It is shown by analysing the capacity upper-bound that the
capacity strongly depends on the position of clusters in the GSCMs and users in
the system. Simulation results show that although the BS receiver does not
require the channel information of all users, by the proposed geometry-based
user scheduling (GUS) algorithm the sum-rate of the system is only slightly
less than the well-known greedy weight clique (GWC) scheme

boundary, it experiences a lift force perpendicular to its direction of motion.
An analogous lift mechanism occurs when a rigid symmetric object translates
parallel to an elastic interface or a soft substrate. The induced lift force is
attributed to an elastohydrodynamic coupling that arises from the breaking of
the flow reversal symmetry induced by the elastic deformation of the
translating object or the interface. Here we derive explicit analytical
expressions for the quasi-steady state lift force exerted on a rigid spherical
particle translating parallel to a finite-sized membrane exhibiting a
resistance toward both shear and bending. Our analytical approach proceeds
through the application of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem so as to obtain the
solution of the flow problem using a perturbation technique for small
deformations of the membrane. We find that the shear-related contribution to
the normal force leads to an attractive interaction between the particle and
the membrane. This emerging attractive force decreases quadratically with the
system size to eventually vanish in the limit of an infinitely-extended
membrane. In contrast, membrane bending leads to a repulsive interaction whose
effect becomes more pronounced upon increasing the system size, where the lift
force is found to diverge logarithmically for an infinitely-large membrane. The
unphysical divergence of the bending-induced lift force can be rendered finite
by regularizing the solution with a cut-off length beyond which the bending
forces become subdominant to an external body force.

moderate correlation (R$\simeq$0.2) between the rise time and the peak flux of
the first peak of the flare irrespective to energy band, which is indicative of
its energy-independent nature. Moreover, magnetic field complexity of the
flaring region is found to be anti-correlated (R=0.61) with the rise time of
the flares while positively correlated (R=0.28) with the peak flux of the

conduction cooling to be dominant in the lower energies. Analysis of 340

only ~17% while the change in specific capacity is negligible. Moreover, we
have also explored the influence of sodium doping in the intercalation site on
the electrochemical, electronic, and structural properties. By considering two
extreme cases of NCAs (i.e., with highest and lowest Co content: NCA_I and

increase the achievable data rates of optical fiber transmission links. One
especially effective technique is digital back propagation (DBP), an algorithm
capable of simultaneously compensating for linear and nonlinear channel
distortions. The most significant barrier to implementing this technique,
however, is its high computational complexity. In recent years, there have been
several proposed alternatives to DBP with reduced computational complexity,
although such techniques have not demonstrated performance benefits
commensurate with the complexity of implementation. In order to fully
characterize the computational requirements of DBP, there is a need to model
the algorithm behavior when constrained to the logic used in a digital coherent
receiver. Such a model allows for the analysis of any signal recovery algorithm
in terms of true hardware complexity which, crucially, includes the bit-depth
of the multiplication operation. With a limited bit depth, there is
quantization noise, introduced with each arithmetic operation, and it can no
longer be assumed that the conventional DBP algorithm will outperform its low
complexity alternatives. In this work, DBP and a single nonlinear step DBP
implementation, the \textit{Enhanced Split Step Fourier} method (ESSFM), were
compared with linear equalization using a generic software model of fixed point
hardware. The requirements of bit depth and fast Fourier transform (FFT) size
are discussed to examine the optimal operating regimes for these two schemes of
digital nonlinearity compensation. For a 1000 km transmission system, it was
found that (assuming an optimized FFT size), in terms of SNR, the ESSFM
algorithm outperformed the conventional DBP for all hardware resolutions up to
13 bits.

However, the mathematical theory for the DR extension still need further
consideration. Utilizing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory,
this paper develops a preliminary mathematical analysis on the out-of-sample DR
extension operators. It treats an out-of-sample DR extension operator as an
extension of the identity on the RKHS defined on $\mathbf{X}$. Then the
Nystr\""{o}m-type DR extension turns out to be an orthogonal projection. In the

theoretical and real-world applications. One of the popular methods for solving
this problem is the proximal gradient method (proximal forward-backward
algorithm). A very common assumption in the use of this method is that the
gradient of the smooth term is globally Lipschitz continuous. However, this
assumption is not always satisfied in practice, thus casting a limitation on
the method. In this paper, we discuss, in a wide class of finite and
infinite-dimensional spaces, a new variant of the proximal gradient method
which does not impose the above-mentioned global Lipschitz continuity
assumption. A key contribution of the method is the dependence of the iterative
steps on a certain telescopic decomposition of the constraint set into subsets.
Moreover, we use a Bregman divergence in the proximal forward-backward
operation. Under certain practical conditions, a non-asymptotic rate of
convergence (that is, in the function values) is established, as well as the
weak convergence of the whole sequence to a minimizer. We also obtain a few
auxiliary results of independent interest.

literature, concerning aerodynamic properties and tip vortex roll-up. This
validation also includes variations of the pitch angle and rotational speed, up
to transonic tip velocities. Compared to previously published methods of
framework adaptation, the new hybrid method is found to reproduce more
accurately the flow around a rotating blade tip.

interacting sectors is studied. Agents populating the stock market are assumed
to be not able to observe the true underlying fundamental, and their beliefs
are biased by either optimism or pessimism. Depending on the relevance they
give to beliefs, they select the best performing strategy in an evolutionary
perspective. The real side of the economy is described within a
multiplier-accelerator framework with a nonlinear, bounded investment function.
We show that strongly polarized beliefs in an evolutionary framework can
introduce multiplicity of steady states, which, consisting in enhanced or
depressed levels of income, reflect and reproduce the optimistic or pessimistic
nature of the agents' beliefs. The polarization of these steady states, which
coexist with an unbiased steady state, positively depends on that of the
beliefs and on their relevance. Moreover, with a mixture of analytical and
numerical tools, we show that such static characterization is inherited also at
the dynamical level, with possibly complex attractors that are characterized by
endogenously fluctuating pessimistic and optimistic levels of national income
and price. This framework, when stochastic perturbations are included, is able
to account for stylized facts commonly observed in real financial markets, such
as fat tails and excess volatility in the returns distributions, as well as
bubbles and crashes for stock prices.

from smartphone is one of the biggest causes for pedestrian fatalities. In this
paper, we develop SaferCross, a mobile system based on the embedded sensors of
smartphone to improve pedestrian safety by preventing distraction from
smartphone. SaferCross adopts a holistic approach by identifying and developing
essential system components that are missing in existing systems and
integrating the system components into a ""fully-functioning"" mobile system for
pedestrian safety. Specifically, we create algorithms for improving the
accuracy and energy efficiency of pedestrian positioning, effectiveness of
phone activity detection, and real-time risk assessment. We demonstrate that
SaferCross, through systematic integration of the developed algorithms,
performs situation awareness effectively and provides a timely warning to the
pedestrian based on the information obtained from smartphone sensors and Direct
Wi-Fi-based peer-to-peer communication with approaching cars. Extensive
experiments are conducted in a department parking lot for both component-level
and integrated testing. The results demonstrate that the energy efficiency and
positioning accuracy of SaferCross are improved by 52% and 72% on average
compared with existing solutions with missing support for positioning accuracy
and energy efficiency, and the phone-viewing event detection accuracy is over
90%. The integrated test results show that SaferCross alerts the pedestrian
timely with an average error of 1.6sec in comparison with the ground truth
data, which can be easily compensated by configuring the system to fire an
alert message a couple of seconds early.

porous building materials with numerical results have been presented in
numerous studies reported in literature. However, some discrepancies have been
observed, highlighting underestimation of sorption process and overestimation
of desorption process. Some studies intend to explain the discrepancies by
analysing the importance of hysteresis effects as well as carrying out
sensitivity analyses on the input parameters as convective transfer
coefficients. This article intends to investigate the accuracy and efficiency
of the coupled solution by adding advective transfer of both heat and moisture
in the physical model. In addition, the efficient Scharfetter and Gummel
numerical scheme is proposed to solve the system of advection-diffusion
equations, which has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically
preserving. Moreover, the scheme is particularly efficient in terms of accuracy
and reduction of computational time when using large spatial discretisation
parameters. Several linear and non-linear cases are studied to validate the
method and highlight its specific features. At the end, an experimental
benchmark from the literature is considered. The numerical results are compared
to the experimental data for a pure diffusive model and also for the proposed
model. The latter presents better agreement with the experimental data. The
influence of the hysteresis effects on the moisture capacity is also studied,
by adding a third differential equation.

multi-element analysis, offering rapid analysis with minimal sample
preparation. However, challenges persist in baseline correction due to
background radiation, causing non-linear interference with emission lines. This
necessitates proper baseline correction for accurate quantification of elements
in LIBS spectra. Our study focuses on the quantification of total carbon in
soil samples, conducting a comparative analysis of filters and methods for
noise removal and baseline correction in LIBS spectra. We exhaustively tested
all combinations of filters and methods, optimizing their parameters to
establish the strongest correlation between corrected spectra and carbon
content in a training sample set. We then evaluated these combinations using
optimized parameters on a separate test sample set. Through rigorous
evaluation, we found that the combination of the Savitzky-Golay filter and the
4S Peak Filling method achieved the most effective baseline correction. This
combination demonstrated a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.93 and a root
mean square error of 0.21. Notably, it outperformed a linear regression model
based solely on the carbon emission line at 193.04 nm, which yielded a
correlation of 0.91 with a root mean square error of 0.26. Our proposed
procedure presents a novel approach for baseline correction in LIBS spectra,
opening new possibilities for the development of multivariate methods utilizing
specific spectral ranges.
