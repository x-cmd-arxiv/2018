images of small dimensionality such as 224 x 244 in Resnet models [24]. This
limitation excludes the 4000 x 3000 dimensional images that are taken by modern
smartphone cameras and smart devices. In this work, we aim to mitigate the
prohibitive inferential and memory costs of operating in such large dimensional
spaces. To sample from the high-resolution original input distribution, we
propose using a smaller proxy distribution to learn the co-ordinates that
correspond to regions of interest in the high-dimensional space. We introduce a
new principled variational lower bound that captures the relationship of the
proxy distribution's posterior and the original image's co-ordinate space in a
way that maximizes the conditional classification likelihood. We empirically
demonstrate on one synthetic benchmark and one real world large resolution DSLR
camera image dataset that our method produces comparable results with ~10x
faster inference and lower memory consumption than a model that utilizes the
entire original input distribution. Finally, we experiment with a more complex
setting using mini-maps from Starcraft II [56] to infer the number of
characters in a complex 3d-rendered scene. Even in such complicated scenes our
model provides strong localization: a feature missing from traditional
classification models.

two-dimensional solitary waves traversing an infinitely deep body of water. We
assume that above the water is vacuum, and that the waves are acted upon by
gravity with surface tension effects on the air--water interface. In
particular, we study the case where there is a finite dipole in the bulk of the
fluid, that is, the vorticity is a sum of two weighted $\delta$-functions.
Using an implicit function theorem argument, we construct a family of solitary
waves solutions for this system that is exhaustive in a neighborhood of $0$.
Our main result is that this family is conditionally orbitally unstable. This
is proved using a modification of the Grillakis--Shatah--Strauss method
recently introduced by Varholm, Wahl\'en, and Walsh.

recognize hidden features of the noise and treat them, we decided to use

ensemble algorithms assigns to base models a set of deterministic, constant
model weights that (1) do not fully account for variations in base model
accuracy across subgroups, nor (2) provide uncertainty estimates for the
ensemble prediction, which could result in mis-calibrated (i.e. precise but
biased) predictions that could in turn negatively impact the algorithm
performance in real-word applications. In this work, we present an adaptive,
probabilistic approach to ensemble learning using dependent tail-free process
as ensemble weight prior. Given input feature $\mathbf{x}$, our method
optimally combines base models based on their predictive accuracy in the
feature space $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$, and provides interpretable
uncertainty estimates both in model selection and in ensemble prediction. To
encourage scalable and calibrated inference, we derive a structured variational
inference algorithm that jointly minimize KL objective and the model's

illustrate the utility of our method on both a synthetic nonlinear function
regression task, and on the real-world application of spatio-temporal

considerable tension in the unitarity constraint on the first row of the CKM

nonlinear systems under the influence of Gaussian noise have recently been
studied already. However, there has been only a few works that examine how most
probable trajectories in the two-dimensional system (MeKS network) are
influenced under non-Gaussian stable L\'evy noise. Therefore, we discuss the
most probable trajectories of a two-dimensional model depicting the competence
behaviour in B. subtilis under the influence of stable L\'evy noise. On the
basis of the Fokker-Planck equation, we describe the noise-induced most
probable trajectories of the MeKS network from the low ComK protein
concentration (vegetative state) to the high ComK protein concentration
(competence state) under stable L\'evy noise. We demonstrate choices of the
non-Gaussianity index $\alpha$ and the noise intensity $\epsilon$ which
generate the ComK protein escape from the low concentration to the high
concentration. We also reveal the optimal combination of both parameters
$\alpha$ and $\epsilon$ making the tipping time shortest. Moreover, we find
that different initial concentrations around the low ComK protein concentration
evolve to a metastable state, and provide the optimal $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$
such that the distance between the deterministic competence state and the
metastable state is smallest.

without censoring or fact-checking messages. We analyze learning as a function
of social network depth (how many times information is relayed) and breadth
(the number of relay chains accessed). Noise builds up as depth increases, so
learning requires greater breadth. In the presence of mutations (deliberate or
random) and transmission failures of messages, we characterize sharp thresholds
for breadths above which receivers learn fully and below which they learn
nothing. When there is uncertainty about mutation rates, optimizing learning
requires either capping depth, or if that is not possible, limiting breadth by
capping the number of people to whom someone can forward a message. Limiting
breadth cuts the number of messages received but also decreases the fraction
originating further from the receiver, and so can increase the signal to noise
ratio. Finally, we extend our model to study learning from message survival:
e.g., people are more likely to pass messages with one conclusion than another.
We find that as depth grows, all learning comes from either the total number of
messages received or from the content of received messages, but the learner
does not need to pay attention to both.

flipped upon interchanging the temperatures of the antennas, thereby enabling
reconfigurability of the polarization state lacked by most circularly polarized
light sources. We describe the fundamental origin of this mechanism using
rigorous fluctuational electrodynamic analysis and further provide practical
examples for its experimental implementation. Apart from the technology

  In the passive parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) optical coupler, a fingerprint of

It is typical to estimate interaction effects from measured activity using

mechanistic insight. Since these statistical techniques fit models to
low-dimensional measurements from brains, they ignore the fact that brain
activity is high-dimensional. Here we focus on the obvious confound of common

few observed ones. Any given observed correlation can be explained by an
infinite set of causal models that take into account the unobserved variables.
Therefore, correlations within massively undersampled measurements tell us

estimation using monocular videos. It is well known in 3D vision that enlarging
the baseline can increase the depth estimation accuracy, and jointly optimizing
a set of camera poses and landmarks is essential. In previous monocular
unsupervised learning frameworks, only part of the photometric and geometric
constraints within a sequence are used as supervisory signals. This may result
in a short baseline and overfitting. Besides, previous works generally estimate
a low resolution depth from a low resolution impute image. The low resolution
depth is then interpolated to recover the original resolution. This strategy
may generate large errors on object boundaries, as the depth of background and
foreground are mixed to yield the high resolution depth. In this paper, we
introduce a bundle adjustment framework and a super-resolution network to solve
the above two problems. In bundle adjustment, depths and poses of an image
sequence are jointly optimized, which increases the baseline by establishing
the relationship between farther frames. The super resolution network learns to
estimate a high resolution depth from a low resolution image. Additionally, we
introduce the clip loss to deal with moving objects and occlusion. Experimental
results on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the

the binary model is less favorable. Here, we model the PG 1302-102 light curve,
spanning almost 20 years, with a supermassive black hole binary system in which
a perturbation in the accretion disk of more massive component is present. Our
model reproduces well the observed light curve with a slight perturbation of a
sinusoidal feature and predicts that a slightly larger period than previously
reported, of about 1899 days, could arise due to a cold spot in the disk of
{\bf more massive} component of a close, unequal-mass
($\frac{\mathrm{m}_{1}}{\mathrm{m}_{2}}=0.1$) black hole binary system. The
light curve resembles the pattern of sinusoid-like shape within a few years,
which could be confirmed by future observations. In addition, using our hybrid
method for periodicity detection, we show that the periods in the observed
($1972\pm 254$ days) and modeled ($1873 \pm \ 250$ days) light curves are
within one-sigma, which is also consistent with our physical model prediction

Static collapsed configurations with mass and quadrupole moment are treated in
detail and the QNM frequencies associated with two such configurations are
evaluated to linear order in the quadrupole moment. Furthermore, we touch upon
the treatment of rotating systems. In particular, the generalized black hole
that we consider for our extensive QNM calculations is a completely collapsed
configuration whose exterior gravitational field can be described by the
Hartle-Thorne spacetime [Astrophys. J. 153, 807-834 (1968)]. This collapsed
system as well as its QNMs is characterized by mass $M$, quadrupole moment $Q$
and angular momentum $J$, where the latter two parameters are treated to first
and second orders of approximation, respectively. When the quadrupole moment is
set equal to the relativistic quadrupole moment of the corresponding Kerr black
hole, $J^2/(Mc^2)$, the Hartle-Thorne QNMs reduce to those of the Kerr black
hole to second order in angular momentum $J$. Using ringdown frequencies, one
cannot observationally distinguish a generalized Hartle-Thorne black hole with

is to maximize rewards directly. Our agent is trained using off-the-shelf
reinforcement learning, but starts every episode by resetting to a state from a

much less exploration to learn a game compared to when it starts from the
beginning of the game at every episode. We analyze reinforcement learning for
tasks with sparse rewards in a simple toy environment, where we show that the
run-time of standard RL methods scales exponentially in the number of states
between rewards. Our method reduces this to quadratic scaling, opening up many
tasks that were previously infeasible. We then apply our method to Montezuma's

No two individuals share the same fingerprint because they have unique
biometric identifiers. This paper presents an efficient fingerprint
verification algorithm which improves matching accuracy. Fingerprint images get
degraded and corrupted due to variations in skin and impression conditions.
Thus, image enhancement techniques are employed prior to singular point
detection and minutiae extraction. Singular point is the point of maximum
curvature. It is determined by the normal of each fingerprint ridge, and then
following them inward towards the centre. The local ridge features known as
minutiae is extracted using cross-number method to find ridge endings and ridge
bifurcations. The proposed algorithm chooses a radius and draws a circle with
core point as centre, making fingerprint images rotationally invariant and
uniform. The radius can be varied according to the accuracy depending on the
particular application. Morphological techniques such as clean, spur and
H-break is employed to remove noise, followed by removing spurious minutiae.
Templates are created based on feature vector extraction and databases are made
for verification and identification for the fingerprint images taken from
Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC2002). Minimum Euclidean distance is
calculated between saved template and the test fingerprint image template and
compared with the set threshold for matching decision. For the performance
evaluation of the proposed algorithm various measures, equal error rate (EER),
Dmin at EER, accuracy and threshold are evaluated and plotted. The measures
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective and robust.

material is particularly notable for its unusually robust quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) behavior, extending downward in temperature to a superconducting
transition at $\approx$ 1.9K. The band structure, in a large energy window
around the Fermi energy, is basically 2D and formed by three Mo t$_{2g}$-like
extended Wannier orbitals (WOs), each one giving rise to a 1D band running at a
120$^\circ$ angle to the two others. A structural 'dimerization' from c/2 to c
gaps the xz and yz bands while leaving the xy bands metallic in the gap but
resonantly coupled to the gap edges and, hence, to the two other directions.
The resulting complex shape of the quasi-1D Fermi surface (FS), verified by our
ARPES, thus depends strongly on the Fermi energy position in the gap, implying
a great sensitivity to Li stoichiometry of properties dependent on the FS, such
as FS nesting or superconductivity. The theory is verified in detail by the
recognition and application of an ARPES selection rule that enables, for the
first time, the separation in ARPES spectra of the two barely split xy bands
and the observation of their complex split FS. The strong resonances prevent
either a two-band tight-binding (TB) model or a related real-space ladder
picture from giving a valid description of the low-energy electronic structure.
Down to a temperature of 6 K we find no evidence for a theoretically expected
downward renormalization of perpendicular single particle hopping due to
Luttinger liquid fluctuations in the quasi-1D chains.

bound by a tight correlation that is defined by the so-called q parameter. This
infrared-radio correlation provides the basis for the use of radio luminosity
as a star-formation tracer. Recent stacking and survival analysis studies find
q to be decreasing with increasing redshift. It was pointed out that a possible
cause of the redshift trend could be the computation of rest-frame radio
luminosity via a single power-law assumption of the star-forming galaxies'
(SFGs) SED.To test this, we constrained the shape of the radio SED of a sample
of HSFGs. To achieve a broad rest-frame frequency range, we combined previously
published VLA observations of the COSMOS field at 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz with
unpublished GMRT observations at 325 MHz and 610 MHz by employing survival
analysis to account for non-detections in the GMRT maps. We selected a sample
of HSFGs in a broad redshift range (0.3<z<4,SFR>100M0/yr) and constructed the
average radio SED. By fitting a broken power-law, we find that the spectral
index changes from $\alpha_1=0.42\pm0.06$ below a rest-frame frequency of 4.3
GHz to $\alpha_2=0.94\pm0.06$ above 4.3 GHz. Our results are in line with
previous low-redshift studies of HSFGs (SFR>10M0/yr) that show the SED of HSFGs
to differ from the SED found for normal SFGs (SFR<10M0/yr). The difference is
mainly in a steeper spectrum around 10 GHz, which could indicate a smaller
fraction of thermal free-free emission. Finally, we also discuss the impact of
applying this broken power-law SED in place of a simple power-law in
K-corrections of HSFGs and a typical radio SED for normal SFGs drawn from the
literature. We find that the shape of the radio SED is unlikely to be the root
cause of the q-z trend in SFGs.

this context, we used Hubble Space Telescope photometry to investigate the MPs
and constrain their chemical composition of four $\sim$6-11 Gyr extragalactic
GCs, namely NGC 121,NGC 339, NGC 416 and Lindsay 1 in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. The comparison of the stellar colors with synthetic spectra suggests
that second-population stars of NGC 121, NGC 339, NGC 416 are slightly enhanced
in helium by $\delta$Y = 0.009$\pm$0.006, 0.007$\pm$0.004 and 0.010$\pm$0.003,
respectively, with respect to the first population, while we find no
significant helium variation in Lindsay 1 ($\delta$Y = 0.000$\pm$0.004).
Moreover, second-population stars of all the clusters are, on average, enhanced
in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen, in close analogy with what we
observe in Galactic GCs.

the uncertainty of $H_0$ in the LSST era, assuming the microlensing time delays

microlensing time delay uncertainties. The relative uncertainty of $H_0$ will
be enlarged to $0.47\%$, $0.51\%$, $0.76\%$, respectively from the one without

equilibrium topological properties characterized by the Chern number of the
pre-quench ground state in dictating the non-equilibrium dynamics of the
system, specifically, the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions
(DQPT). By investigating the ground state fidelity, it is found that a change
in the signed Chern number constitutes a sufficient but not necessary condition
for the occurrence of DQPTs. Depending on the ratio of the transverse and
longitudinal hopping parameters, DQPTs may also be observed for quenches lying
entirely within the initial Chern phase. Additionally, we analyze the zeros of
the boundary partition function discovering that while the zeros generally form
two-dimensional structures resulting in one-dimensional critical times,
infinitesimal quenches may lead to one-dimensional zeros with zero-dimensional
critical times provided the quench distance scales appropriately with the
system size. This is strikingly manifested in the nature of non-analyticies of
the dynamical free energy, revealing a logarithmic singularity. In addition,
following recent experimental advances in observing the dynamical Fisher zeros
of the Loschmidt overlap amplitude through azimuthal Bloch phase vortices by
Bloch-state tomography, we rigorously investigate the same in WSMs. Finally, we
establish the relationship between the dimension of the critical times and the
presence of dynamical vortices, demonstrating that only one-dimensional

and the connections are treated as independent variables, by use of several
constraints on the connections. Assuming the Einstein-Hilbert action, we find
that the equations for the distortion tensor (torsion and non-metricity) become
algebraic, which means that those variables are not dynamical. As a result, we
can rewrite the basic equations in the form of Riemannian geometry. Although
all classified models recover the Einstein gravity in the Palatini formalism
(in which we assume there is no coupling between matter and the connections),
but when matter field couples to the connections, the effective Einstein
equations include an additional hyper energy-momentum tensor obtained from the
distortion tensor. Assuming a simple extension of a minimally coupled scalar
field in metric-affine gravity, we analyze an inflationary scenario. Even if we
adopt a chaotic inflation potential, certain parameters could satisfy
observational constraints. Furthermore, we find that a simple form of Galileon
scalar field in metric-affine could cause G-inflation.

which can be utilized to rank the variables that affect two quantity of
interests -- pore pressure depletion and stress change -- around a
hydraulically-fractured horizontal well based on their degree of importance.
These variables include rock properties and stimulation design variables. A
fully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore
pressure and stress changes due to production. To ease the computational cost
of a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which can be used
to replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model,
for calculating the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around
hydraulic fractures. The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,
production pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the
changes in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of
each parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic
fractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect
of mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)
These two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large
distances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture
tips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and
half-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.
The results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation
design of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill
drilling.

Grounding network (SSG), to localize the referent given a referring expression
within an image. Different from previous multi-stage models which rely on
object proposals or detected regions, our proposed model aims to comprehend a
referring expression through one single stage without resorting to region
proposals as well as the subsequent region-wise feature extraction.
Specifically, a multimodal interactor is proposed to summarize the local region
features regarding the referring expression attentively. Subsequently, a
grounder is proposed to localize the referring expression within the given
image directly. For further improving the localization accuracy, a guided
attention mechanism is proposed to enforce the grounder to focus on the central
region of the referent. Moreover, by exploiting and predicting visual attribute
information, the grounder can further distinguish the referent objects within
an image and thereby improve the model performance. Experiments on RefCOCO,
RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSG without
relying on any region proposals can achieve comparable performance with other
advanced models. Furthermore, our SSG outperforms the previous models and
achieves the state-of-art performance on the ReferItGame dataset. More
importantly, our SSG is time efficient and can ground a referring expression in
a 416*416 image from the RefCOCO dataset in 25ms (40 referents per second) on
average with a Nvidia Tesla P40, accomplishing more than 9* speedups over the

time-to-solution for geophysical fluid problems are becoming increasingly
difficult with standard time integrators. Parallel-in-time exposes and exploits
additional parallelism in the time dimension which is inherently sequential in
traditional methods. The rational approximation of exponential integrators
(REXI) method allows taking arbitrarily long time steps based on a sum over a
number of decoupled complex PDEs that can be solved independently massively
parallel. Hence REXI is assumed to be well suited for modern massively parallel
super computers which are currently trending. To date the study and development
of the REXI approach has been limited to linearized problems on the periodic 2D
plane. This work extends the REXI time stepping method to the linear
shallow-water equations (SWE) on the rotating sphere, thus moving the method
one step closer to solving fully nonlinear fluid problems of geophysical
interest on the sphere. The rotating sphere poses particular challenges for
finding an efficient solver due to the zonal dependence of the Coriolis term.
Here we present an efficient REXI solver based on spherical harmonics, showing
the results of: a geostrophic balance test, a comparison with alternative time
stepping methods, an analysis of dispersion relations, indicating superior
properties of REXI, and finally a performance comparison on Cheyenne
supercomputer. Our results indicate that REXI is not only able to take larger
time steps, but that REXI can also be used to gain higher accuracy and
significantly reduced time-to-solution compared to currently existing time
stepping methods.

events such as small exceedance probabilities, extreme quantiles and return
periods. The main problem with the Peaks-Over Threshold method relates to the
selection of threshold above and below which the asymptotic results are valid
for large and small observations respectively. In addition, the main assumption
leading to the asymptotic results is that the observations are independent and
identically distributed. However, in practice, many real life processes yield
data that are non-stationary and/or related to some covariate variables. As a
result, threshold selection gets complicated as it may depend on the
covariates. Strong arguments have been made against the use of constant
threshold as observation that is considered extreme at some covariate level may
not qualify as an extreme observation at another covariate level. Some authors
have attempted to obtain covariate dependent thresholds in different ways: the
most appealing one relies on quantile regression. In this paper, we propose a
covariate dependent threshold based on expectiles. We compare this threshold
with the constant and the quantile regression in a simulation study for
estimating the tail index of the Generalised Pareto distribution. As may be
expected, no threshold is universally the best. However, certain general
observations can be made for the exponential growth data considered. Firstly,
we find that the expectile threshold outperforms the others when the response
variable has smaller to medium values. Secondly, for larger values of the
response variable, the constant threshold is generally the best method. The
threshold selection methods are illustrated in the estimation of the tail index
of an insurance claims data.

novel method called density-equalizing reference map (DERM) for mapping 3D
carotid surfaces to a standardized 2D carotid template, with an emphasis on
preserving the local geometry of the carotid surface by minimizing the local
area distortion. The initial map was generated by a previously described
arc-length scaling (ALS) mapping method, which projects a 3D carotid surface
onto a 2D non-convex L-shaped domain. A smooth and area-preserving flattened
map was subsequently constructed by deforming the ALS map using the proposed
algorithm that combines the density-equalizing map and the reference map
techniques. This combination allows, for the first time, one-to-one mapping
from a 3D surface to a standardized non-convex planar domain in an
area-preserving manner. Evaluations using 20 carotid surface models show that
the proposed method reduced the area distortion of the flattening maps by over
80% as compared to the ALS mapping method.

currents. The evolution of the MFR is observed by the Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) from
multiple viewpoints. From STEREO's perspective, the MFR starts to rise slowly
above the limb five hours before it erupts as a halo CME on 2012 June 14. In
SDO observations, conjugate dimmings develop on the disk, simultaneously with
the gradual expansion of the MFR, suggesting that the dimmings map the MFR's
feet. The evolution comprises a two-stage gradual expansion followed by another
stage of rapid acceleration/eruption. Quantitative measurements indicate that
magnetic twist of the MFR increases from 1.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 turns
during the five-hour expansion, and further increases to about 4.0 turns per AU
when detected as a magnetic cloud at 1 AU two day later. In addition, each
stage is preceded by flare(s), implying reconnection is actively involved in
the evolution and eruption of the MFR. The implications of these measurements
on the CME initiation mechanisms are discussed.

Spaces, Oculus Rooms, and Oculus Venues, will generate increased interest from
users who want to share real places (both personal and public) with their
fellow users in VR. At the same time, advances in scanning and reconstruction
technology are making the realistic capture of real places more and more
feasible. These complementary pressures mean that the representation of real
places in virtual reality will be an increasingly common use case for VR.
Despite this, there has been very little research into how users perceive such
replicated spaces. This paper reports the results from a series of three user
studies investigating this topic. Taken together, these results show that
getting the scale of the space correct is the most important factor for
generating a ""feeling of reality"", that it is important to avoid incoherent
behaviors (such as floating objects), and that lighting makes little difference
to perceptual similarity.

vertex of two types of the graph is adjacent to at most $1$ and at most $z$
($\geqslant 1$) edges, respectively. The $z$-matching problem concerns finding
$z$-matchings with the maximum size. Our approach to this combinatorial
optimization problem is twofold. From an algorithmic perspective, we adopt a
local algorithm as a linear approximate solver to find $z$-matchings on any
graph instance, whose basic component is a generalized greedy leaf removal
procedure in graph theory. From a theoretical perspective, on uncorrelated
random bipartite graphs, we develop a mean-field theory for percolation
phenomenon underlying the local algorithm, leading to an analytical estimation
of $z$-matching sizes on random graphs. Our analytical theory corrects the
prediction by belief propagation algorithm at zero-temperature limit in
(Krea\v{c}i\'{c} and Bianconi 2019 \textsl{EPL} \textbf{126} 028001). Besides,
our theoretical framework extends a core percolation analysis of $k$-XORSAT

because the design space is combinatorially large. Due to this, previous neural
architecture search (NAS) methods are computationally expensive. ConvNet
architecture optimality depends on factors such as input resolution and target
devices. However, existing approaches are too expensive for case-by-case
redesigns. Also, previous work focuses primarily on reducing FLOPs, but FLOP
count does not always reflect actual latency. To address these, we propose a
differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework that uses
gradient-based methods to optimize ConvNet architectures, avoiding enumerating
and training individual architectures separately as in previous methods.
FBNets, a family of models discovered by DNAS surpass state-of-the-art models

Despite higher accuracy and lower latency than MnasNet, we estimate FBNet-B's

different resolutions and channel sizes, FBNets achieve 1.5% to 6.4% higher

Time series mining handles several tasks such as classification, clustering,
query-by-content, prediction, and others. Performing data mining tasks on raw
time series is inefficient as these data are high-dimensional by nature.
Instead, time series are first pre-processed using several techniques before
different data mining tasks can be performed on them. In general, there are two
main approaches to reduce time series dimensionality, the first is what we call
landmark methods. These methods are based on finding characteristic features in
the target time series. The second is based on data transformations. These
methods transform the time series from the original space into a reduced space,
where they can be managed more efficiently. The method we present in this paper
applies a third approach, as it projects a time series onto a lower-dimensional
space by selecting important points in the time series. The novelty of our
method is that these points are not chosen according to a geometric criterion,
which is subjective in most cases, but through an optimization process. The
other important characteristic of our method is that these important points are
selected on a dataset-level and not on a single time series-level. The direct
advantage of this strategy is that the distance defined on the low-dimensional
space lower bounds the original distance applied to raw data. This enables us
to apply the popular GEMINI algorithm. The promising results of our experiments
on a wide variety of time series datasets, using different optimizers, and
applied to the two major data mining tasks, validate our new method.

correspondence, which is fundamental to statistical analysis of systems in
curved spacetime. This is of immense importance, in that the fluctuations of
stress tensor play a similar central role in stochastic gravity, as that of the
stress tensor in classical and semiclassical gravity. A relation between the
semiclassical and classical fluctuations therefore, gives insight to the
mesoscopic phenomena for gravitating systems and would further enhance the
perturbative analysis for cosmological spacetime and astrophysical objects,

previously: it provides a single metric which correlates with both impact in
terms of citations (c) and output in terms of publications (p). We argue for
weighting using four percentile classes: the top-1% and top-10% as excellence
indicators; the top-50% and bottom-50% as output indicators. Like the h-index,
which also incorporates both c and p, I3*-values are size-dependent; however,
division of I3* by the number of publications (I3*/N) provides a
size-independent indicator which correlates strongly with the two- and
five-year Journal Impact Factors (JIF2 and JIF5). Unlike the h-index, I3*
correlates significantly with both the total number of citations and

the expectation or against one another using chi-square tests or effect sizes.

DQC contains wave divider and wave combiner operations. The wave function of a
quantum computer is split into several subwaves after the wave division
operation. Then different unitary operations are performed on different
subwaves in parallel. A quantum wave combiner combines the subwaves into a
final wave function, so that a linear combination of the unitaries are
performed on the final state. In this paper, we study of the properties of
duality quantum computer with projections on subwaves. In subwave-projection
DQC (SWP-DQC), we can realize the linear combinations of non-unitaries, and
this not only gives further flexibility for designing quantum algorithms, but
also offers additional speedup in the expected time complexity. Specifically,
SWP-DQC offers an O(M) acceleration over DQC with only final-wave-projection in
the mean time complexity, where M is the number of projections. As an
application, we show that the ground state preparation algorithm recently

biophysical neuronal and synaptic properties that permit such motifs to arise
and how the different coherence states determine the communication between the
neural circuits. We analyse the emergence of phase locking within
bidirectionally delayed-coupled spiking circuits showing global gamma band
oscillations. We consider both the interneuronal (ING) and the
pyramidal-interneuronal (PING) gamma rhythms and the inter coupling targeting
the pyramidal or the inhibitory interneurons. Using a mean-field approach
together with an exact reduction method, we break down each spiking network
into a low dimensional nonlinear system and derive the macroscopic phase
resetting-curves (mPRCs) that determine how the phase of the global oscillation
responds to incoming perturbations. Depending on the type of gamma oscillation,
we show that incoming excitatory inputs can either only speed up the
oscillation (phase advance; type I PRC) or induce both an advance and a delay
the macroscopic oscillation (phase delay; type II PRC). From there we determine
the structure of macroscopic coherence states (phase locking) of two weakly
synaptically-coupled networks. To do so we derive a phase equation for the
coupled system which links the synaptic mechanisms to the coherence state of
the system. We show that the transmission delay is a necessary condition for
symmetry breaking, i.e. a non-symmetric phase lag between the macroscopic
oscillations, potentially giving an explanation to the experimentally observed

are spectral features, generally appearing in absorption, in the X-ray spectra
of objects containing highly magnetized neutron stars, allowing the direct
measurement of the magnetic field strength in these objects. Cyclotron features
are thought to be due to resonant scattering of photons by electrons in the
strong magnetic fields. The main content of this contribution focusses on
electron cyclotron lines as found in accreting X-ray binary pulsars (XRBP) with
magnetic fields on the order of several 1012 Gauss. Also, possible proton
cyclotron lines from single neutron stars with even stronger magnetic fields
are briefly discussed.With regard to electron cyclotron lines, we present an
updated list of XRBPs that show evidence of such absorption lines. The first
such line was discovered in a 1976 balloon observation of the accreting binary
pulsar Hercules X-1, it is considered to be the first direct measurement of the
magnetic field of a neutron star. As of today (mid 2018), we list 36 XRBPs
showing evidence of one ore more electron cyclotron absorption line(s). A few
have been measured only once and must be confirmed (several more objects are
listed as candidates). In addition to the Tables of objects, we summarize the
evidence of variability of the cyclotron line as a function of various
parameters (especially pulse phase, luminosity and time), and add a discussion
of the different observed phenomena and associated attempts of theoretical
modeling. We also discuss our understanding of the underlying physics of
accretion onto highly magnetized neutron stars. For proton cyclotron lines, we
present tables with seven neutron stars and discuss their nature and the
physics in these objects.

in a cavity setup via a double off-resonance stimulated Raman scattering,

greatly simplify the realistic implementation. We also show that the

find that substantial squeezing is still attainable with current laboratory

observational evidence for ongoing energy injection, which may be from magnetar
spindown due to energy released via either magnetic dipole (MD) or
gravitational wave (GW) radiation. In this paper, by systematically analyzing
the {\em Swift}/XRT light curves detected before 2018 July, we find 45 light
curves with a measured redshift that monotonically decay as a smooth broken
power law. By assuming that the central engines of these GRBs are newly born
magnetars, we measure the braking index $n$ of putative millisecond magnetars,
due to MD and GW radiations. The inferred braking indices are not close to 3 or
5, but range between them with a normal distribution ($n_{\rm c}=4.02\pm
0.11$). We define a dimensionless parameter $\Re$, which is the ratio between
the MD and GW components, and find that the energy released via magnetar
spindown in most GRBs of our sample is dominated by GW radiation for $P_0=3$ ms
and $\epsilon=0.005$ and 0.01. On the other hand, we find that $\Re$ and the
braking index $n$ seem to be anticorrelated within a large systematic error at
$t=0$, but depend on the values of the parameters $P_0$ and $\epsilon$. These
results suggest that the contribution of GW radiation cannot be ignored, and
that a larger braking index leads to GWs dominating the energy released during
magnetar spindown if indeed magnetars are operating in some long GRBs.

classifier patching on neural networks. Neural network patching is an approach
for adapting neural network models to handle concept drift in nonstationary
environments. Instead of creating or updating the existing network to
accommodate concept drift, neural network patching leverages the inner layers
of the network as well as its output to learn a patch that enhances the
classification and corrects errors caused by the drift. It learns (i) a
predictor that estimates whether the original network will misclassify an
instance, and (ii) a patching network that fixes the misclassification. Neural
network patching is based on the idea that the original network can still
classify a majority of instances well, and that the inner feature
representations encoded in the deep network aid the classifier to cope with
unseen or changed inputs. In order to apply this kind of patching, we evaluate
different engagement layers and patch architectures in this report, and find a
set of generally applicable heuristics, which aid in parametrizing the patching
procedure.

algorithms for numeric data are relatively well studied in the literature,
there are still challenges to address in case of categorical data. The main
issue is the unordered structure of categorical data, which makes the
implementation of the standard concepts of clustering algorithms difficult. For
instance, the assessment of distance between objects, the selection of
representatives for categorical data is not as straightforward as for
continuous data. Therefore, this paper presents a new framework for
partitioning categorical data, which does not use the distance measure as a key

an alternative to existing ones and can be an efficient knowledge discovery

algorithms, no theoretical analysis has been provided even for simple cases. To
address this shortfall, we start by formulating an ideal definition of
difficulty score - the loss of the optimal hypothesis at a given datapoint. We
analyze the possible contribution of curriculum learning based on this score in
two convex problems - linear regression, and binary classification by hinge
loss minimization. We show that in both cases, the expected convergence rate
decreases monotonically with the ideal difficulty score, in accordance with
earlier empirical results. We also prove that when the ideal difficulty score
is fixed, the convergence rate is monotonically increasing with respect to the
loss of the current hypothesis at each point. We discuss how these results
bring to term two apparently contradicting heuristics: curriculum learning on
the one hand, and hard data mining on the other.

public code repositories, as well as developing binaries in-house. Our results
demonstrate that ICSREF can successfully handle diverse PLC binaries from
varied industry sectors, irrespective of the programming language used.
Furthermore, we deploy ICSREF on a commercial smartphone which orchestrates and

involving glueball by using the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model. Since baryon in
this model is recognized as the D4-brane wrapped on $S^{4}$ and the glueball
field is identified as the bulk gravitational fluctuations, the interaction of
the bulk graviton and the baryon brane could be naturally interpreted as
glueball-baryon interaction through the holography which is nothing but the
close-open string interaction in string theory. In order to take account into
the heavy flavour, an extra pair of heavy-flavoured branes separated from the
other flavour branes with a heavy-light open string is embedded into the bulk.
Due to the finite separation of the flavour branes, the heavy-light string
creates massive multiplets which could be identified as the heavy-light meson
fields in this model. As the baryon brane on the other hand could be
equivalently described by the instanton configuration on the flavour brane, we
solve the equations of motion for the heavy-light fields with the
Belavin-Polyakov-Schwarz-Tyupkin (BPST) instanton solution for the $N_{f}=2$
flavoured gauge fields. Then with the solutions, we evaluate the soliton mass
by deriving the flavoured onshell action in strongly coupling limit and heavy
quark limit. After the collectivization and quantization, the quantum
mechanical system for glueball and heavy-flavoured baryon is obtained in which
the effective Hamiltonian is time-dependent. Finally we use the standard
technique for the time-dependent quantum mechanical system to analyze the decay
of heavy-flavoured baryon involving glueball and we find one of the decay
process might correspond to the decay of baryonic B-meson involving the
glueball candidate $f_{0}\left(1710\right)$. This work is a holographic
approach to study the decay of heavy-flavoured hadron in nuclear physics.

the goal is speaker prediction; we expect a performance improvement with this
joint training if the two tasks of speech recognition and speaker recognition
share a common set of underlying features. In contrast, adversarial learning is
a means to learn representations invariant to the speaker. We then expect
better performance if this learnt invariance helps generalizing to new
speakers. While the two approaches seem natural in the context of speech
recognition, they are incompatible because they correspond to opposite
gradients back-propagated to the model. In order to better understand the
effect of these approaches in terms of error rates, we compare both strategies
in controlled settings. Moreover, we explore the use of additional
untranscribed data in a semi-supervised, adversarial learning manner to improve
error rates. Our results show that deep models trained on big datasets already
develop invariant representations to speakers without any auxiliary loss. When

photometry at $3.6\,\mu m$ and high quality rotation curves. The sample has
been constructed to span very wide ranges in surface brightness, luminosity,
rotation velocity and Hubble type, thereby forming a representative sample on
galaxies in the nearby Universe. To date, the SPARC sample is the largest
collection of galaxies with both high-quality rotation curves and NIR surface
photometry.
  The neo-MOND model used here to analyse the SPARC sample recognizably
conforms to the general pattern of the classical MOND algorithm, with the
primary difference that, whereas the classical MOND model is purely
phenomonological, the neo-MOND model is a special case of a general theory
motivated by the ideas of Leibniz and Mach (not discussed here). The consequent
main results can be broadly summarized as follows:
  (1) neo-MOND provides the basis for the derivation of a complete theory of
the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation; (2) the details of the derivation provide a
means of setting absolute distance scales for disc galaxies independently of
standard candles and the photometric method; (3) subsequent determinations of
dynamical mass (computed directly from neo-MOND fits to SPARC rotation curves)
track photometric mass (estimated from SPARC surface photometry) across the
whole SPARC sample in a statistically perfect way.
  To summarize, if the input to neo-MOND is disk dynamical data, then the
output is whole-disk mass data together with absolute distance scales.

the polar region, ice sheets can be several kilometres long and subjected to
the effects of ocean waves. As its thickness to length ratio is very small, the
wave response of such a large ice sheet, known as its hydroelastic response, is
dominated by an elastic deformation rather than rigid body motions. In the past
25 years, sea ice hydroelasticity has been widely studied by theoretical
models; however, recent experiments indicate that the ideal assumptions used
for these theoretical models can cause considerable inaccuracies. This work
proposes a numerical approach based on OpenFOAM to simulate the hydroelastic
wave-ice interaction, with the Navier-Stokes equations describing the fluid
domain, the St. Venant Kirchhoff solid model governing the ice deformation and
a coupling scheme to achieve the fluid-structure interaction. Following
validation against experiments, the proposed model has been shown capable of
capturing phenomena that have not been included in current theoretical models.
In particular, the developed model shows the capability to predict overwash,
which is a ubiquitous polar phenomenon reported to be a key gap. The present
model has the potential to be used to study wave-ice behaviours and the coupled

is challenging. Vertebrae usually share similar morphological appearance.
Because of pathology and the arbitrary field-of-view of CT scans, one can
hardly rely on the existence of some anchor vertebrae or parametric methods to
model the appearance and shape. To solve the problem, we argue that one should
make use of the short-range contextual information, such as the presence of
some nearby organs (if any), to roughly estimate the target vertebrae; due to
the unique anatomic structure of the spine column, vertebrae have fixed
sequential order which provides the important long-range contextual information
to further calibrate the results.
  We propose a robust and efficient vertebrae identification and localization
system that can inherently learn to incorporate both the short-range and
long-range contextual information in a supervised manner. To this end, we
develop a multi-task 3D fully convolutional neural network (3D FCN) to
effectively extract the short-range contextual information around the target
vertebrae. For the long-range contextual information, we propose a multi-task
bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-RNN) to encode the spatial and
contextual information among the vertebrae of the visible spine column. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a challenging dataset
and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

jet associated with Herbig-Haro objects 80 and 81 (HH 80-81) is known as the
largest and best collimated protostellar jet in our Galaxy. The nature of the
molecular outflow associated with this extraordinary jet remains an unsolved
question which is of great interests to our understanding of the relationship
between jets and outflows in high-mass star formation. Here we present Atacama
Pathfinder EXperiment CO(6-5) and (7-6), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope CO(3-2),
Caltech Submillimeter Observatory CO(2-1), and Submillimeter Array CO and
$^{13}$CO(2-1) mapping observations of the outflow. We report on the detection
of a two-component outflow consisting of a collimated component along the jet
path and a wide-angle component with an opening angle of about $30^{\circ}$.
The gas velocity structure suggests that each of the two components traces part
of a primary wind. From LVG calculations of the CO lines, the outflowing gas
has a temperature around 88 K, indicating that the gas is being heated by
shocks. Based on the CO(6-5) data, the outflow mass is estimated to be a few
$M_{\odot}$, which is dominated by the wide-angle component. A comparison
between the HH 80-81 outflow and other well shaped massive outflows suggests
that the opening angle of massive outflows continues to increase over time.
Therefore, the mass loss process in the formation of early-B stars seems to be
similar to that in low-mass star formation, except that a jet component would
disappear as the central source evolves to an ultracompact HII region.

$G$ such that each edge $e$ appears on at least one cycle. The common objective
in cycle cover computation is to minimize the total lengths of all cycles.
Motivated by applications to distributed computation, we introduce the notion
of \emph{low-congestion} cycle covers, in which all cycles in the cycle
collection are both \emph{short} and nearly \emph{edge-disjoint}. Formally, a
$(d,c)$-cycle cover of a graph $G$ is a collection of cycles in $G$ in which
each cycle is of length at most $d$ and each edge participates in at least one
cycle and at most $c$ cycles. A-priori, it is not clear that cycle covers that
enjoy both a small overlap and a short cycle length even exist, nor if it is
possible to efficiently find them. Perhaps quite surprisingly, we prove the
following: Every bridgeless graph of diameter $D$ admits a $(d,c)$-cycle cover
where $d = \tilde{O}(D)$ and $c=\tilde{O}(1)$. These parameters are
existentially tight up to polylogarithmic terms. Furthermore, we show how to
extend our result to achieve universally optimal cycle covers. Let $C_e$ is the
length of the shortest cycle that covers $e$, and let $OPT(G)= \max_{e \in G}
C_e$. We show that every bridgeless graph admits a $(d,c)$-cycle cover where $d
= \tilde{O}(OPT(G))$ and $c=\tilde{O}(1)$. We demonstrate the usefulness of low
congestion cycle covers in different settings of resilient computation. For
instance, we consider a Byzantine fault model where in each round, the
adversary chooses a single message and corrupt in an arbitrarily manner. We
provide a compiler that turns any $r$-round distributed algorithm for a graph
$G$ with diameter $D$, into an equivalent fault tolerant algorithm with $r\cdot

for single particle wave function the plasmon wave function and corresponding
electrostatic potential are characterized with two different wave numbers
associated with two distinct characteristic length scales, namely, that of the

Interaction of plasmon with a rectangular potential step/well indicates
features common with that of the ordinary single quantum particle. However, the
two-tone oscillation character of the wave function and potential appear on the
transmitted amplitude over the potential barrier/well. The plasmon propagation
is found to have a distinct energy gap corresponding to the plasmon energy
value of $\epsilon_g=\mu_0+2\epsilon_p$ below which no plasmon excitations
occur. For instance, the zero-point plasmon excitation energy for Aluminium, is
around $\epsilon_0\simeq 41.7$eV at room temperature, with the Fermi energy of

seen that for plasmon energies very close to the energy gap, i.e. where the two
characteristic scales match ($k_1\simeq k_2$), the quantum beating effect takes
place. The study of plasmon tunneling through the potential barrier indicates
that the transmittivity has oscillatory behavior similar to that of a quantum
particle tunneling through the potentials, but, with a characteristic two-tone
oscillatory profiles. Current development can have a broad range of
applications in plasmon transport through diverse free electron environments

diagnosis of congenital anomalies. Knowledge of fetal gestational age is the
key to the accurate assessment of brain development. This study develops an
attention-based deep learning model to predict gestational age of the fetal
brain. The proposed model is an end-to-end framework that combines key insights
from multi-view MRI including axial, coronal, and sagittal views. The model
also uses age-activated weakly-supervised attention maps to enable
rotation-invariant localization of the fetal brain among background noise. We
evaluate our methods on the collected fetal brain MRI cohort with a large age
distribution from 125 to 273 days. Our extensive experiments show age
prediction performance with R2 = 0.94 using multi-view MRI and attention.

  detection: a sequence to sequence deep learning approach",,,,,"q-bio.QM eess.SP physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a common and powerful tool to study heart
function and diagnose several abnormal arrhythmias. While there have been
remarkable improvements in cardiac arrhythmia classification methods, they
still cannot offer acceptable performance in detecting different heart
conditions, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we
propose a solution to address this limitation of current classification
approaches by developing an automatic heartbeat classification method using
deep convolutional neural networks and sequence to sequence models. We
evaluated the proposed method on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, considering
the intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms, and the AAMI EC57 standard. The
evaluation results for both paradigms show that our method achieves the best
performance in the literature (a positive predictive value of 96.46% and
sensitivity of 100% for the category S, and a positive predictive value of
98.68% and sensitivity of 97.40% for the category F for the intra-patient

  with deep visual attention",,,,,"q-bio.QM eess.SP physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The complexity of the patterns associated with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and
the high level of noise affecting these patterns have significantly limited the
current signal processing and shallow machine learning approaches to get
accurate AF detection results. Deep neural networks have shown to be very
powerful to learn the non-linear patterns in the data. While a deep learning
approach attempts to learn complex pattern related to the presence of AF in the
ECG, they can benefit from knowing which parts of the signal is more important
to focus during learning. In this paper, we introduce a two-channel deep neural
network to more accurately detect AF presented in the ECG signal. The first
channel takes in a preprocessed ECG signal and automatically learns where to
attend for detection of AF. The second channel simultaneously takes in the
preprocessed ECG signal to consider all features of entire signals. The model
shows via visualization that what parts of the given ECG signal are important
to attend while trying to detect atrial fibrillation. In addition, this
combination significantly improves the performance of the atrial fibrillation
detection (achieved a sensitivity of 99.53%, specificity of 99.26% and accuracy
of 99.40% on the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database with 5-s ECG segments.)

ideas. For that purpose we will consider the change of the topology of the
spatial component seen as compact 3-manifold. We analyzed the topology change
by using Morse theory and handle body decomposition of manifolds. For the
general case of a topology change of a $n-$manifold, we are forced to introduce
a scalar field with quadratic potential or double well potential. Unfortunately
these cases are ruled out by the CMB results of the Planck misssion. In case of
3-manifolds there is another possibility which uses deep results in
differential topology of 4-manifolds. With the help of these results we will
show that in case of a fixed homology of the 3-manifolds one will obtain a
scalar field potential which is conformally equivalent to the Starobinsky
model. The free parameter of the Starobinsky model can be expressed by the
topological invariants of the 3-manifold. Furthermore we are able to express
the number of e-folds as well as the energy and length scale by the
Chern-Simons invariant of the final 3-manifold. We will apply these result to a
specific model which was used by us to discuss the appearance of the
cosmological constant with an experimentally confirmed value.

moisture exposure. The different crystal structures of two phases result in
distinct optoelectronic properties including optical absorption, refractive
index, and carrier transport. The perovskite photodetector array for the
non-volatile rewritable optical memory application is further investigated. A
near-infrared (NIR) laser ({\lambda} = 1064 nm) is used to selectively heat
photodetector pixels through the photothermal effect of the interfacial Ag
electrodes, resulting in an optically absorbing perovskite phase for the
photodetectors. The locations of specific laser-written pixels can be read out
by measuring their photocurrents, and the stored optical information can also
be erased by moisture exposure. Finally, a proof-of-concept optical imaging
application has been demonstrated using perovskite photodetector arrays
fabricated on flexible PET substrates. These results show promising
applications of vapor-deposited inorganic perovskite for optical memory and
image sensors, with unique potential for low-cost manufacturing of large-area

i.e., living three-dimensional tumour brain models, and demonstrate a random

computational reservoir, performs programmed optical functions and detects
