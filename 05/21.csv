inverse images of a smooth map, which is a fundamental tool in studying smooth
manifolds using generic smooth maps whose codimensions are not positive such as
Morse functions, their higher dimensional versions including fold maps and
general stable maps. A special generic map is a fold map and a generalization
of Morse functions with just 2 singular points on homotopy spheres and the Reeb
space is a compact manifold whose dimension is equal to that of the target
manifold and which can be immersed into the target manifold. In this paper, we
generalize a quotient map onto a Reeb space of a special generic map. We define
a map onto a polyhedron locally a quotient map induced from a special generic
map. Moreover, we take advantage of the generalized maps to construct lifts of
Morse functions of a certain class; the composition of the lift and the
canonical projection is the original funciton. It is an answer of an explicit
problem in the studies of lifts of smooth maps, or maps such that the
compositions of the found maps and the canonical projections are original maps,
which are fundamental and important in the studies of smooth maps and
applications to algebraic and differential topology of manifolds.

which the sparse signal of interest can be recovered from extremely quantized
measurements. Namely, only the sign of each measurement is available to us. In
many applications, the ground-truth signal is not sparse itself, but can be
represented in a redundant dictionary. A strong line of research has addressed
conventional CS in this signal model including its extension to one-bit
measurements. However, one-bit CS suffers from the extremely large number of
required measurements to achieve a predefined reconstruction error level. A
common alternative to resolve this issue is to exploit adaptive schemes.
Adaptive sampling acts on the acquired samples to trace the signal in an
efficient way. In this work, we utilize an adaptive sampling strategy to
recover dictionary-sparse signals from binary measurements. For this task, a
multi-dimensional threshold is proposed to incorporate the previous signal
estimates into the current sampling procedure. This strategy substantially
reduces the required number of measurements for exact recovery. Our proof
approach is based on the recent tools in high dimensional geometry in
particular random hyperplane tessellation and Gaussian width. We show through
rigorous and numerical analysis that the proposed algorithm considerably
outperforms state of the art approaches. Further, our algorithm reaches an
exponential error decay in terms of the number of quantized measurements.

fundamentally faster than all of the other standard algorithms that minimize
the sum of $n$ smooth functions, such as SAGA, SAG, SDCA, and SDCA without
duality. Most finite sum algorithms follow what we call the ""span assumption"":
Their updates are in the span of a sequence of component gradients chosen in a
random IID fashion. In the big data regime, where the condition number
$\kappa=\mathcal{O}(n)$, the span assumption prevents algorithms from
converging to an approximate solution of accuracy $\epsilon$ in less than
$n\ln(1/\epsilon)$ iterations. SVRG and SARAH do not follow the span assumption
since they are updated with a hybrid of full-gradient and component-gradient
information. We show that because of this, they can be up to
$\Omega(1+(\ln(n/\kappa))_+)$ times faster. In particular, to obtain an
accuracy $\epsilon = 1/n^\alpha$ for $\kappa=n^\beta$ and
$\alpha,\beta\in(0,1)$, modified SVRG requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ iterations,
whereas algorithms that follow the span assumption require
$\mathcal{O}(n\ln(n))$ iterations. Moreover, we present lower bound results
that show this speedup is optimal, and provide analysis to help explain why
this speedup exists. With the understanding that the span assumption is a point
of weakness of finite sum algorithms, future work may purposefully exploit this
to yield even faster algorithms in the big data regime.

within one navigation pass. Our approach interleaves between object analysis to
identify the next best object (NBO) for global exploration, and object-aware
information gain analysis to plan the next best view (NBV) for local scanning.
First, an objectness-based segmentation method is introduced to extract
semantic objects from the current scene surface via a multi-class graph cuts
minimization. Then, an object of interest (OOI) is identified as the NBO which
the robot aims to visit and scan. The robot then conducts fine scanning on the
OOI with views determined by the NBV strategy. When the OOI is recognized as a
full object, it can be replaced by its most similar 3D model in a shape
database. The algorithm iterates until all of the objects are recognized and
reconstructed in the scene. Various experiments and comparisons have shown the
feasibility of our proposed approach.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a policy improvement algorithm for Reinforcement Learning (RL)
which is called Rerouted Behavior Improvement (RBI). RBI is designed to take
into account the evaluation errors of the Q-function. Such errors are common in
RL when learning the $Q$-value from finite past experience data. Greedy
policies or even constrained policy optimization algorithms which ignore these
errors may suffer from an improvement penalty (i.e. a negative policy
improvement). To minimize the improvement penalty, the RBI idea is to attenuate
rapid policy changes of low probability actions which were less frequently
sampled. This approach is shown to avoid catastrophic performance degradation
and reduce regret when learning from a batch of past experience. Through a
two-armed bandit with Gaussian distributed rewards example, we show that it
also increases data efficiency when the optimal action has a high variance. We
evaluate RBI in two tasks in the Atari Learning Environment: (1) learning from
observations of multiple behavior policies and (2) iterative RL. Our results
demonstrate the advantage of RBI over greedy policies and other constrained
policy optimization algorithms as a safe learning approach and as a general
data efficient learning algorithm. An anonymous Github repository of our RBI
implementation is found at https://github.com/eladsar/rbi.

independence system and candidate objective functions, we choose an independent
set, and then an adversary chooses one objective function, knowing our choice.
Our goal is to find a randomized strategy (i.e., a probability distribution
over the independent sets) that maximizes the expected objective value. To
solve the problem, we propose two types of schemes for designing approximation
algorithms. One scheme is for the case when objective functions are linear. It
first finds an approximately optimal aggregated strategy and then retrieves a
desired solution with little loss of the objective value. The approximation
ratio depends on a relaxation of an independence system polytope. As
applications, we provide approximation algorithms for a knapsack constraint or
a matroid intersection by developing appropriate relaxations and retrievals.
The other scheme is based on the multiplicative weights update method. A key
technique is to introduce a new concept called $(\eta,\gamma)$-reductions for
objective functions with parameters $\eta, \gamma$. We show that our scheme
outputs a nearly $\alpha$-approximate solution if there exists an
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm for a subproblem defined by
$(\eta,\gamma)$-reductions. This improves approximation ratio in previous
results. Using our result, we provide approximation algorithms when the
objective functions are submodular or correspond to the cardinality robustness
for the knapsack problem.

arises as the asymptotic symmetry group of four-dimensional asymptotically flat

Firstly, we illustrate how the BMS group emerges from the analysis of the
asymptotic conditions on the gravitational field. We summarise both the
original metric-based method by Bondi, Metzner, van der Burg and Sachs, and the
geometrical approach by Penrose. Then, we analyse the Carroll Group and, in
particular, its conformal extension which, in the case of a conformal
transformation of N=2 level, is equivalent to the BMS group in four dimensions.
The motivation to study the properties of the groups related to the BMS is that
they may shed light on some open question regarding the BMS group itself, such
as its representation theory, its extension to higher dimensions and its use
for flat holography. We conclude by showing an example on how the Carroll group
arises as the symmetry group of plane gravitational waves.

simple datasets like MNIST, but break on more complicated ones like ImageNet

it does not need to incorporate any information of the desired formation.
Instead, the achieved formation pattern is totally attributed to the geometric

Given a collection of masses and a set of linear springs with a specified cost

propose a network slicing based communication model for vehicular networks. In
this paper, we have modelled a multi-lane highway scenario with vehicles having
heterogeneous traffic requirements. Autonomous driving slice (exchanges safety
messages) and infotainment slice (provides video stream) are the two logical
slices created on a common infrastructure. In addition, a relaying approach is
utilized to improve the performance of low

low SINR vehicles are served by other infotainment vehicles, which have high

teaching to improve agent learning has been investigated by prior works, but
these approaches make assumptions that prevent application of teaching to
general multiagent problems, or require domain expertise for problems they can
apply to. This learning to teach problem has inherent complexities related to
measuring long-term impacts of teaching that compound the standard multiagent
coordination challenges. In contrast to existing works, this paper presents the
first general framework and algorithm for intelligent agents to learn to teach
in a multiagent environment. Our algorithm, Learning to Coordinate and Teach
Reinforcement (LeCTR), addresses peer-to-peer teaching in cooperative
multiagent reinforcement learning. Each agent in our approach learns both when
and what to advise, then uses the received advice to improve local learning.
Importantly, these roles are not fixed; these agents learn to assume the role
of student and/or teacher at the appropriate moments, requesting and providing
advice in order to improve teamwide performance and learning. Empirical
comparisons against state-of-the-art teaching methods show that our teaching
agents not only learn significantly faster, but also learn to coordinate in

regressor can be associated to a location in a physical space, or more

statistical power, the so-called multi-task techniques were proposed, which
consist in the simultaneous estimation of several related models. Combined with
sparsity assumptions, it lead to models enforcing the active regressors to be
shared across models, thanks to, for instance L1 / Lq norms. We argue in this
paper that these techniques fail to leverage the spatial information associated
to regressors. Indeed, while sparse priors enforce that only a small subset of

tasks is overly simplistic given the spatial variability observed in real data.
In this paper, we propose a convex regularizer for multi-task regression that
encodes a more flexible geometry. Our regularizer is based on unbalanced
optimal transport (OT) theory, and can take into account a prior geometric
knowledge on the regressor variables, without necessarily requiring overlapping
supports. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a regularized formulation

coordination. A BC framework has been developed to achieve global coordination
tasks with low communication volume. The BC law uses broadcast communication,
which transmits an identical signal to all agents indiscriminately without any
agent-to-agent communication. Unfortunately, all of the agents are required to
take numerous random actions because the BC law is based on stochastic
optimization. Such random actions degrade the control performance for
coordination tasks and may invoke dangerous situations. In order to overcome
these drawbacks, the present paper proposes the pseudo-perturbation-based
broadcast control (PBC) law, which introduces multiple virtual random actions
instead of the single physical action of the BC law. The following advantages
of the PBC law are theoretically proven. The PBC law achieves coordination
tasks asymptotically with probability 1. Compared with the BC law, unavailing
actions are reduced and agents' states converge at least twice as fast.
Increasing the number of multiple actions further improves the control
performance because averaging multiple actions reduces unavailing randomness.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that the PBC improves the control performance
as compared with the BC law.

= 2.0 K. Its crystal structure consists of two layers of a buckled honeycomb
network of SnP, bound by the vdW forces and separated by Na ions, as similar to
that of NaSn2As2. Amount of Na deficiency (x) was estimated to be 0.074(18)
using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Bulk nature of superconductivity was
confirmed by the measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility, and specific heat. First-principles calculation using density
functional theory shows that Na1-xSn2P2 and NaSn2As2 have comparable electronic
structure, suggesting higher Tc of Na1-xSn2P2 is resulted from increased
density of states at the Fermi level due to Na deficiency. Because there are
various structural analogues with tin-pnictide (SnPn) conducting layers, our
results indicate that SnPn-based layered compounds can be categorized into a
novel family of vdW-type superconductors, providing a new platform for studies
on physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.

crystallisation in granular matter remains relatively poorly understood. To
investigate this behaviour further and bridge the fields of granular matter and
materials science, we simulated mono-disperse spheres confined in cylindrical
containers to study their structural dynamics during vibration. By applying
adequate vibration, disorder-to-order transitions were induced. Such
transitions were characterised at the particle scale through bond orientation
order parameters. As a result, emergent crystallisation was indicated by the
enhancement of the local order of individual particles and the number of
ordered particles. The observed heterogeneous crystallisation was characterised
by the evolution of the spatial distributions via coarse-graining the order
index. Crystalline regimes epitaxially grew from templates formed near the
container walls during vibration, here termed the wall effect. By varying the
geometrical dimensions of cylindrical containers, the obtained crystallised

However, SNNs are yet to reach the same performances of conventional deep
artificial neural networks (ANNs), a long-standing challenge due to complex
dynamics and non-differentiable spike events encountered in training. The
existing SNN error backpropagation (BP) methods are limited in terms of
scalability, lack of proper handling of spiking discontinuities, and/or
mismatch between the rate-coded loss function and computed gradient. We present
a hybrid macro/micro level backpropagation (HM2-BP) algorithm for training
multi-layer SNNs. The temporal effects are precisely captured by the proposed
spike-train level post-synaptic potential (S-PSP) at the microscopic level. The
rate-coded errors are defined at the macroscopic level, computed and
back-propagated across both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Different from
existing BP methods, HM2-BP directly computes the gradient of the rate-coded
loss function w.r.t tunable parameters. We evaluate the proposed HM2-BP
algorithm by training deep fully connected and convolutional SNNs based on the

accuracy level of 99.49% and 98.88% for MNIST and N-MNIST, respectively,
outperforming the best reported performances obtained from the existing SNN BP

different aspects of information that can be used for object grasping,
manipulation, and perception. In this paper inference of some key tactile
features, tip displacement, contact location, shear direction and magnitude, is
demonstrated by introducing a novel method of transducing a third dimension to
the sensor data via Voronoi tessellation. The inferred features are displayed
throughout the work in a new visualisation mode derived from the Voronoi
tessellation; these visualisations create easier interpretation of data from an
optical tactile sensor that measures local shear from displacement of internal
pins (the TacTip). The output values of tip displacement and shear magnitude
are calibrated to appropriate mechanical units and validate the direction of
shear inferred from the sensor. We show that these methods can infer the
direction of shear to $\sim$2.3$^{\circ}$ without the need for training a
classifier or regressor. The approach demonstrated here will increase the
versatility and generality of the sensors and thus allow sensor to be used in
more unstructured and unknown environments, as well as improve the use of these
tactile sensors in more complex systems such as robot hands.

1 to 1.9 in $\sim 8$ years. The brightest spectrum, with Eddington ratio
$L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.08$, has a typical type 1 AGN continuum, with a strong
""soft X-ray excess"" spanning between the UV and soft X-rays. The dimmest
spectrum, at $L/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.006$, is very different in shape as well as
luminosity, with the soft excess dropping by much more than the hard X-rays.
The soft X-ray excess produces most of the ionizing photons, so its dramatic
drop leads to the disappearance of the broad line region, driving the
""changing-look"" phenomena. This spectral hardening appears similar to the
soft-to-hard state transition in black hole binaries at $L/L_{\rm Edd} \sim
0.02$, where the inner disc evaporates into an advection dominated accretion
flow, while the overall drop in luminosity appears consistent with the Hydrogen
ionization disc instability. Nonetheless, both processes happen much faster in
Mrk 1018 than predicted by disc theory. We critically examine scaling from
galactic binary systems, and show that a major difference is that radiation
pressure should be much more important in AGNs, so that the sound speed is much
faster than expected from the gas temperature. Including magnetic pressure to
stabilize the disc shortens the timescales even further. We suggest that all
changing-look AGNs are similarly associated with the state transition at
$L/L_{\rm Edd} \sim$ a few percent.

shown that there exists a polynomial $F_d(G,x)$ such that the number of the
nowhere-zero $\Gamma$-flows in $G$ equals $F_d(G,x)$ evaluated at $k$ for every
Abelian group $\Gamma$ of order $k$ with $\epsilon(\Gamma)=d$, where
$\epsilon(\Gamma)$ is the largest integer $d$ for which $\Gamma$ has a subgroup
isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^d_2$. We focus on the combinatorial structure of
$\Gamma$-flows in a signed graph and the coefficients in $F_d(G,x)$. We first
define the fundamental directed circuits for a signed graph $G$ and show that
all $\Gamma$-flows (not necessarily nowhere-zero) in $G$ can be generated by
these circuits. It turns out that all $\Gamma$-flows in $G$ can be evenly
classified into $2^{\epsilon(\Gamma)}$-classes specified by the elements of
order 2 in $\Gamma$, each class of which consists of the same number of flows
depending only on the order of the group. This gives an explanation for why the
number of $\Gamma$-flows in a signed graph varies with different
$\epsilon(\Gamma)$, and also gives an answer to a problem posed by Beck and
Zaslavsky. Secondly, using an extension of Whitney's broken circuit theory we
give a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients in $F_d(G,x)$ for
$d=0$, in terms of the broken bonds. As an example, we give an analytic
expression of $F_0(G,x)$ for a class of the signed graphs that contain no

preserve all the uniprocessor optimizations while building a shared memory
multiprocessor. The efforts to formalize weak memory models of ARM and POWER
over the last decades are mostly empirical -- they try to capture empirically
observed behaviors -- and end up providing no insight into the inherent nature
of weak memory models. This paper takes a constructive approach to find a
common base for weak memory models: we explore what a weak memory would look
like if we constructed it with the explicit goal of preserving all the
uniprocessor optimizations. We will disallow some optimizations which break a
programmer's intuition in highly unexpected ways. The constructed model, which
we call General Atomic Memory Model (GAM), allows all four load/store
reorderings. We give the construction procedure of GAM, and provide insights
which are used to define its operational and axiomatic semantics. Though no
attempt is made to match GAM to any existing weak memory model, we show by
simulation that GAM has comparable performance with other models. No deep
knowledge of memory models is needed to read this paper.

finite element algorithms for linear and nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs). The main idea of these algorithms is to utilize the solutions
on the $k$-th level adaptive meshes to find the solutions on the $(k+1)$-th
level adaptive meshes which are constructed by performing adaptive element
bisections on the $k$-th level adaptive meshes. These algorithms transform
non-symmetric positive definite (non-SPD) PDEs (resp., nonlinear PDEs) into
symmetric positive definite (SPD) PDEs (resp., linear PDEs). The proposed
algorithms are both accurate and efficient due to the following advantages:
they do not need to solve the non-symmetric or nonlinear systems; the degrees
of freedom (d.o.f.) are very small; they are easily implemented; the
interpolation errors are very small. Next, this paper constructs residue-type
{\em a posteriori} error estimators, which are shown to be reliable and
efficient. The key ingredient in proving the efficiency is to establish an
upper bound of the oscillation terms, which may not be higher-order terms
(h.o.t.) due to the low regularity of the numerical solution. Furthermore, the
convergence of the algorithms is proved when bisection is used for the mesh
refinements. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to verify the accuracy
and efficiency of the ATG finite element algorithms, compared to regular
adaptive finite element algorithms and two-grid finite element algorithms [27].

Recently, the basic multi-kernel approach has been proposed to solve the OCC

weights. This paper proposes a Localized Multiple Kernel learning approach for
Anomaly Detection (LMKAD) using OCC, where the weight for each kernel is

against existing Multi Kernel Anomaly Detection (MKAD) algorithm, and four

adversarial examples, a new threat model where the attackers are not restricted
to small norm-bounded perturbations. Different from perturbation-based attacks,
we propose to synthesize unrestricted adversarial examples entirely from
scratch using conditional generative models. Specifically, we first train an
Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) to model the
class-conditional distribution over data samples. Then, conditioned on a
desired class, we search over the AC-GAN latent space to find images that are
likely under the generative model and are misclassified by a target classifier.
We demonstrate through human evaluation that unrestricted adversarial examples
generated this way are legitimate and belong to the desired class. Our
empirical results on the MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA datasets show that
unrestricted adversarial examples can bypass strong adversarial training and
certified defense methods designed for traditional adversarial attacks.

training method because of its efficiency; however, recently, a problem in SGD
gains research interest: sharp minima in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have poor
generalization; especially, large-batch SGD tends to converge to sharp minima.
It becomes an open question whether escaping sharp minima can improve the
generalization. To answer this question, we propose SmoothOut framework to
smooth out sharp minima in DNNs and thereby improve generalization. In a
nutshell, SmoothOut perturbs multiple copies of the DNN by noise injection and
averages these copies. Injecting noises to SGD is widely used in the
literature, but SmoothOut differs in lots of ways: (1) a de-noising process is
applied before parameter updating; (2) noise strength is adapted to filter
norm; (3) an alternative interpretation on the advantage of noise injection,
from the perspective of sharpness and generalization; (4) usage of uniform
noise instead of Gaussian noise. We prove that SmoothOut can eliminate sharp
minima. Training multiple DNN copies is inefficient, we further propose an
unbiased stochastic SmoothOut which only introduces the overhead of noise
injecting and de-noising per batch. An adaptive variant of SmoothOut,
AdaSmoothOut, is also proposed to improve generalization. In a variety of
experiments, SmoothOut and AdaSmoothOut consistently improve generalization in
both small-batch and large-batch training on the top of state-of-the-art
solutions.

simultaneously and can be more precise than estimating them individually. Our
interest here is to determine fundamental quantum limits to the achievable
multiparameter estimation precision in the presence of noise. We present a
lower bound to the estimation error covariance for a noisy initial probe state
evolving via a noiseless quantum channel. We then present a lower bound to the
estimation error covariance in the most general form for a noisy initial probe
state evolving via a noisy quantum channel. We show conditions and accordingly
measurements to attain these estimation precision limits for noisy systems. We
see that the Heisenberg precision scaling of $1/N$ can be achieved with a probe
comprising $N$ particles even in the presence of noise. In fact, some noise in
the initial probe state or the quantum channel can serve as a feature rather
than a bug, since the estimation precision scaling achievable in the presence
of noise in the initial state or the channel in some situations is impossible
in the absence of noise in the initial state or the channel. However, a lot of
noise harms the quantum advantage achievable with $N$ parallel resources, and
allows for a best precision scaling of $1/\sqrt{N}$. Moreover, the Heisenberg
precision limit can be beaten with noise in the channel, and we present a
super-Heisenberg precision limit with scaling of $1/N^2$ for optimal amount of
noise in the channel, characterized by one-particle evolution operators.
Further, using $\gamma$-particle evolution operators for the noisy channel,
where $\gamma>1$, the best precision scaling attainable is $1/N^{2\gamma}$,

approach involves introducing the theory of ""spectral interpolation of triple

provides a dichotomy on discrete elementary amenable groups: either they are
non quasi-Hermitian or they have subexponential growth. Finally, for a

work, we propose a high-order, implicit-explicit numerical scheme that combines
Multi-Level Spectral Deferred Corrections (MLSDC) and the Spherical Harmonics
(SH) transform to solve the wave-propagation problems arising from the
shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere.
  The iterative temporal integration is based on a sequence of corrections
distributed on coupled space-time levels to perform a significant portion of
the calculations on a coarse representation of the problem and hence to reduce
the time-to-solution while preserving accuracy. In our scheme, referred to as
MLSDC-SH, the spatial discretization plays a key role in the efficiency of
MLSDC, since the SH basis allows for consistent transfer functions between
space-time levels that preserve important physical properties of the solution.
  We study the performance of the MLSDC-SH scheme with shallow-water test cases
commonly used in numerical atmospheric modeling. We use this suite of test
cases, which gradually adds more complexity to the nonlinear system of
governing partial differential equations, to perform a detailed analysis of the
convergence rate of MLSDC-SH upon refinement in time. We illustrate the good
stability properties of MLSDC-SH and show that the proposed scheme achieves up
to eighth-order accuracy in time. Finally, we study the conditions in which
MLSDC-SH achieves its theoretical speedup, and we show that it can
significantly reduce the computational cost compared to single-level Spectral
Deferred Corrections (SDC).

description of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter.By
assuming the electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium and the
interaction in the linear response regime, the theorem interrelates the
spontaneous fluctuations of microscopic variables with the kinetic coefficients
that are responsible for energy dissipation.In the quantum form provided by
Callen and Welton in their pioneer paper of 1951 for the case of conductors,
electrical noise detected at the terminals of a conductor was given in terms of
the spectral density of voltage fluctuations, $S_V({\omega})$, and was related
to the real part of its impedance, $Re[Z({\omega})]$, by a simple relation.The
drawbacks of this relation concern with: (I) the appearance of a zero point
contribution which implies a divergence of the spectrum at increasing
frequencies; (ii) the lack of detailing the appropriate equivalent-circuit of
the impedance, (iii) the neglect of the Casimir effect associated with the
quantum interaction between zero-point energy and boundaries of the considered
physical system; (iv) the lack of identification of the microscopic noise
sources beyond the temperature model. These drawbacks do not allow to validate
the relation with experiments. By revisiting the FDT within a brief historical
survey, we shed new light on the existing drawbacks by providing further
properties of the theorem, focusing on the electrical noise of a two-terminal
sample under equilibrium conditions. Accordingly, we will discuss the duality
and reciprocity properties of the theorem, its applications to the ballistic
transport regime, to the case of vacuum and to the case of a photon gas.

quantities due to time translation invariance, and, if the volume in phase
space, defined by their intersection, is compact, microcanonical averages can
be defined and there isn't any instability, in the sense of Ostrogradsky, even
though each Hamiltonian, individually, may define a non-compact (hyper)surface.
  We provide as concrete example of these statements the Pais--Uhlenbeck
oscillator and show that it can describe a system that makes sense in the
microcanonical ensemble. It describes two oscillators that are coupled by
imposing a fixed phase difference, that thereby describes a non--local
interaction between them. The consistent quantum dynamics can straightforwardly
be expressed using two pairs of creation and annihilation operators, with the
phase difference describing a flux, that describes the interaction.
  The properties of the action imply that particular solutions, that would
describe independent oscillators, are, in general, not admissible.The reason is
that the coordinate transformation, that would decouple the oscillators isn't a
symmetry of the action--unless a ""BPS bound"" is saturated. Only then do they
decouple. But, in these cases, the action does describe one, not two,
oscillators, anyway and the higher derivative term is a coordinate artifact.

roughly measure the saliency of image regions with a baseline LRMR model that
integrates a $\ell_1$-norm sparsity constraint and a Laplacian regularization

merger of two white dwarfs (double-degenerate scenario) has been frequently
denoted to be more promising than a single-degenerate white dwarf. Recently the
importance of observing the MeV gamma-ray band to conclusively determine the
origin has been remarked. MeV gamma-rays are unique probes directly emitted
from the exploding or merging region. It is evident that statistical analysis
based on imaging spectroscopic observations of ~100 SNe Ia with MeV gamma-rays
is necessary to obtain a definite answer. To achieve this, a telescope with a
sensitivity that is 100 times that of COMPTEL is necessary. Proper imaging
spectroscopy for the MeV gamma-ray band has been established by an
electron-tracking Compton camera; hence, a concrete design of a MeV gamma-ray
telescope has been proposed in our previous work. We have studied the details
of the spectroscopic feature of SNe Ia based on the performance of a proposed
telescope and found that statistical analysis can considerably suppress
fluctuations of the individual properties of SNe and reveal their intrinsic
differences in averaged light curves of SNe up to 60 Mpc. Our answer for the

versatility and ability to approach or exceed human-level accuracy. These
computational models have seemingly insatiable appetites for computational
resources not only while training, but also when deployed at scales ranging
from data centers all the way down to embedded devices. As such, increasing
consideration is being made to maximize the computational efficiency given
limited hardware and energy resources and, as a result, inferencing with
reduced precision has emerged as a viable alternative to the IEEE 754 Standard
for Floating-Point Arithmetic. We propose a quantization scheme that allows
inferencing to be carried out using arithmetic that is fundamentally more
efficient when compared to even half-precision floating-point. Our quantization
procedure is significant in that we determine our quantization scheme
parameters by calibrating against its reference floating-point model using a
single inference batch rather than (re)training and achieve end-to-end post
quantization accuracies comparable to the reference model.

properties of the first stars. In this study we pay special attention to
tracing the time evolution of the ionizing photons' escape fraction, which
affects the distribution of neutral hydrogen, by performing radiation
hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations resolving dense gas in a halo. We find that the
radial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive
to the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape
fraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape
from its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm
absorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time. Whereas photons
from a massive star well working to heat the ambient intergalactic medium turn
out to cause a spatially extended 21-cm emission signature. Although individual
signals are found to be undetectable with the Square Kilometre Array, our
analysis using the results from the RHD simulations indicates that the
properties of the first stars are imprinted on the 21-cm global signal: its
amplitude depends not only on the cosmic star formation rate density, but also
on the typical mass of the first stars due to the stellar-mass-dependent
heating rate. Thus, we suggest that the initial mass function of the first
stars is an essential factor in understanding the global signal.

odd-frequency nor spin-triplet correlations are induced, but only
even-frequency spin-singlet pairing. In the superconducting regions of NS
junctions, the interface-induced amplitudes decay into the bulk, with the
odd-frequency components being generally much larger than the even-frequency

silence in synchronous settings, in which processes can fail. We formalize
sufficient conditions for information transfer using silence, as well as
necessary conditions for particular cases of interest. This allows us to
identify message patterns that enable communication through silence. In

noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate) in a double-well potential with
periodically varying depths of the potential wells. The suppression of
tunneling is possible for a single state and for superposition of two states,
i.e. for a qbit. By varying spin-orbit coupling one can drastically increase
the range of modulation frequencies in which an atom remains localized in one
of the potential wells, the effect connected with crossing of energy levels.
This range of frequencies is limited because temporal modulation may also
excite resonant transitions between lower and upper states in different wells.
The resonant transitions enhance tunneling and are accompanied by pseudo-spin
switching. Since the frequencies of the resonant transitions are independent of
potential modulation depth, in contrast to frequencies at which suppression of
tunneling occurs, by varying this depth one can dynamically control both
spatial localization and pseudo-spin of the final state.

galaxies. In analogy with the standard theory of accretion discs, our theory is
based on shear viscous forces among nested annuli of gas. However, the fact
that gas follows non circular orbits in an external barred potential has
profound consequences: it creates a region of reverse shear in which it is
energetically favourable to form a stable ring which does not spread despite
dissipation. Our theory allows us to approximately predict the size of the ring
given the underlying gravitational potential. The size of the ring is loosely
related to the location of the Inner Lindblad Resonance in the epicyclic
approximation, but the predicted location is more accurate and is also valid
for strongly barred potentials. By comparing analytical predictions with the
results of hydrodynamical simulations, we find that our theory provides a
viable mechanism for ring formation if the effective sound speed of the gas is
low ($\cs\lesssim1\kms$), but that nuclear spirals/shocks created by pressure
destroy the ring when the sound speed is high ($\cs\simeq10\kms$). We conclude
that whether this mechanism for ring formation is relevant for real galaxies
ultimately depends on the effective equation of state of the ISM. Promising
confirmation comes from simulations in which the ISM is modelled using
state-of-the-art cooling functions coupled to live chemical networks, but more
tests are needed regarding the role of turbulence driven by stellar feedback.
If the mechanism is relevant in real galaxies, it could provide a powerful tool
to constrain the gravitational potential, in particular the bar pattern speed.

exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we
tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus
on the training phase of a machine learning model. We generate adversarial

taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that
the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data

efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our
experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly
drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are
transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node
classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful
even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.

windowed by a tapered cosine function is applied. The mechanical response of
the gel is then analyzed in the Fourier domain. We show that i) OWCh leads to
an accurate computation of the full frequency spectrum at a rate significantly
faster than with the traditional discrete frequency sweeps, and with a
reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio, and ii) the bulk viscoelastic response

mechanical model corresponding to a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model with a single
Scott-Blair (or springpot) element and a spring in parallel. By varying the
viscous damping and the particle mass used in the microscopic simulations over
a wide range of values, we demonstrate the existence of a single master curve
for the frequency dependence of the viscoelastic response of the gel that is
fully predicted by the constitutive model. By developing a fast and robust
protocol for evaluating the linear viscoelastic spectrum of these soft solids,
we open the path towards novel multiscale insight into the rheological response

Hausdorff measure $H^{n-2}(S_\epsilon^{n-2})<C(n,v)$, such that $X^n\setminus

This improves the regularity results of \cite{ChCoI}. Additionally, we will see
that tangent cones are unique of a subset of Hausdorff $(n-2)$ dimensional

by adding X-ray ionization and heating. We study the metallicity dependence of
the disk photoevaporation rate and examine the importance of X-ray radiation.
In the fiducial case with solar metallicity, including the X-ray effects does
not significantly increase the photoevaporation rate when compared to the case
with ultra-violet (UV) radiation only. At sub-solar metallicities in the range
of $Z \gtrsim 10^{-1.5} \, Z_\odot $, the photoevaporation rate increases as
metallicity decreases owing to the reduced opacity of the disk medium. The
result is consistent with the observational trend that disk lifetimes are
shorter in low metallicity environments. Contrastingly, the photoevaporation
rate decreases at even lower metallicities of $Z \lesssim 10^{-1.5} \, Z_\odot
$, because dust-gas collisional cooling remains efficient compared to far UV
photoelectric heating whose efficiency depends on metallicity. The net cooling
in the interior of the disk suppresses the photoevaporation. However, adding
X-ray radiation significantly increases the photoevaporation rate, especially
at $Z \sim 10^{-2}\, Z_\odot$. Although the X-ray radiation itself does not
drive strong photoevaporative flows, X-rays penetrate deep into the neutral
region in the disk, increase the ionization degree there, and reduce positive
charges of grains. Consequently, the effect of photoelectric heating by far UV
radiation is strengthened by the X-rays and enhances the disk photoevaporation.

the splitting and merging of clusters should be considered differently,
according to the operationalization of the stability of clusters. The Rand
Index is symmetric in the sense that both the splitting and merging of clusters
lower the value of the index. In such a non-symmetric case, one of the Wallace
indexes (Wallace, 1983) can be used. Further, there are several cases when one
wants to compare two partitions obtained on different sets of units, where the

solution for high-speed indoor connectivity for fixed and mobile optical
communications. Unlike conventional radio frequency wireless systems, the OWC
channel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects the
channel gain significantly, particularly for mobile users. However, due to the
lack of a proper model for device orientation, many studies have assumed that
the receiver is vertically upward and fixed. In this paper, a novel model for
device orientation based on experimental measurements of forty participants has
been proposed. It is shown that the probability density function (PDF) of the
polar angle can be modeled either based on a Laplace (for static users) or a
Gaussian (for mobile users) distribution. In addition, a closed-form expression
is obtained for the PDF of the cosine of the incidence angle based on which
line-of-sight (LOS) channel gain is described in OWC channels. An approximation
of this PDF based on the truncated Laplace is proposed and the accuracy of this
approximation is confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KSD). Moreover,
the statistics of the LOS channel gain are calculated and the random
orientation of a user equipment (UE) is modeled as a random process. The
influence of the random orientation on signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) performance
of OWC systems has been evaluated. Finally, an orientation-based random
waypoint (ORWP) mobility model is proposed by considering the random
orientation of the UE during the user's movement. The performance of ORWP is

  Behavior","Accepted at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2018",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inferring intent from observed behavior has been studied extensively within
the frameworks of Bayesian inverse planning and inverse reinforcement learning.
These methods infer a goal or reward function that best explains the actions of
the observed agent, typically a human demonstrator. Another agent can use this
inferred intent to predict, imitate, or assist the human user. However, a
central assumption in inverse reinforcement learning is that the demonstrator
is close to optimal. While models of suboptimal behavior exist, they typically
assume that suboptimal actions are the result of some type of random noise or a
known cognitive bias, like temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we take an
alternative approach, and model suboptimal behavior as the result of internal
model misspecification: the reason that user actions might deviate from
near-optimal actions is that the user has an incorrect set of beliefs about the
rules -- the dynamics -- governing how actions affect the environment. Our
insight is that while demonstrated actions may be suboptimal in the real world,
they may actually be near-optimal with respect to the user's internal model of
the dynamics. By estimating these internal beliefs from observed behavior, we
arrive at a new method for inferring intent. We demonstrate in simulation and
in a user study with 12 participants that this approach enables us to more
accurately model human intent, and can be used in a variety of applications,
including offering assistance in a shared autonomy framework and inferring
human preferences.

domain to an unsupervised target domain. A number of effective domain
adaptation approaches rely on the ability to extract discriminative, yet
domain-invariant, latent factors which are common to both domains. Extracting
latent commonality is also useful for disentanglement analysis, enabling
separation between the common and the domain-specific features of both domains.
In this paper, we present a method for boosting domain adaptation performance

synthesize more target domain data with supervision, thereby boosting the
domain adaptation performance. Better common feature extraction, in turn, helps
further improve the disentanglement analysis and disentangled synthesis. We

extreme singular values of the associated Gaussian ensemble nor on the use of
mutual incoherence arguments. A relevant consequence of our analysis, compared
to prior work, is that a significantly sharper restricted eigenvalue constant
can be obtained under weaker assumptions. In particular, the sparsity of the
unknown parameter and the number of outliers are allowed to be completely
independent of each other.

current observing facilities to their limits. The next generation of
high-resolution spectrographs mounted on large telescopes -- such as
ESPRESSO@VLT and HIRES@ELT -- will allow us to probe and characterize
exoplanetary atmospheres in greater detail than possible to this point. We
present a method that permits the recovery of the colour-dependent reflectivity
of exoplanets from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Determining the
wavelength-dependent albedo will provide insight into the chemical properties
and weather of the exoplanet atmospheres.
  For this work, we simulated ESPRESSO@VLT and HIRES@ELT high-resolution
observations of known planetary systems with several albedo configurations. We
demonstrate how the cross correlation technique applied to theses simulated
observations can be used to successfully recover the geometric albedo of
exoplanets over a range of wavelengths. In all cases, we were able to recover
the wavelength dependent albedo of the simulated exoplanets and distinguish
between several atmospheric models representing different atmospheric
configurations.
  In brief, we demonstrate that the cross correlation technique allows for the
recovery of exoplanetary albedo functions from optical observations with the
next generation of high-resolution spectrographs that will be mounted on large
telescopes with reasonable exposure times. Its recovery will permit the
characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres in terms of composition and
dynamics and consolidates the cross correlation technique as a powerful tool
for exoplanet characterization.

dissipative model can lead the system to be overdamped in some (or all) modes.
In the domain of the damping parameters, the thresholds between induced
oscillatory and non--oscillatory motion are called critical damping surfaces

method to obtain critical damping surfaces for nonviscously damped systems is

of a stellar object. By measuring the astrometric shift of a background source
star in combination with precise predictions of its unlensed position and of
the lens position, gravitational lensing allows to determine the mass of the
lensing star with a precision of 1 percent, independent of any prior knowledge.
  Aims. Making use of the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) we
predict astrometric microlensing events by foreground stars of high proper
motion passing by a background star in the coming years.
  Methods. We compile a list of ~148.000 high-proper-motion stars within Gaia
DR2 with $\mu_{tot}$ > 150 mas/yr. We then search for background stars close to
their paths and calculate the dates and separations of the closest approaches.
Using color and absolute magnitude, we determine approximate masses of the
lenses. Finally, we calculate the expected astrometric shifts and
magnifications of the predicted events.
  Results . We detect two ongoing microlensing events by the high proper motion
stars Luyten 143-23 and Ross 322 and predict closest separations of (108.5
$\pm$ 1.4) mas in July 2018 and (125.3 $\pm$ 3.4) mas in August 2018,
respectively. The respective expected astrometric shifts are (1.74 $\pm$ 0.12)
mas and (0.76 $\pm$ 0.06) mas. Furthermore, Luyten 143-23 will pass by another
star in March 2021 with a closest separation of (280.1 $\pm$ 1.1) mas, which
results in an expected shift of (0.69 $\pm$ 0.05) mas.

making any attempt at debunking inefficient. Such a configuration occurs even
in the consumption of news online, and considering that 63% of users access

allows for further spreading of misinformation. Along this path, we focus on
the polarization of users around news outlets on Facebook in different European
countries (Italy, France, Spain and Germany). First, we compare the pages'
posting behavior and the users' interacting patterns across countries and
observe different posting, liking and commenting rates. Second, we explore the
tendency of users to interact with different pages (i.e., selective exposure)

Then, we introduce a new metric -- i.e., polarization rank -- to measure
polarization of communities for each country. We find that Italy is the most
polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain. Finally, we
present a variation of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence
of these communities by considering the users' engagement and trust on the

context of neural networks, it alleviates the need for back propagation and
reduces the memory consumption dramatically. However, the method is not a pure

structure of typical learning problems. Promising first results of the EnKF for
training deep neural networks have been presented recently by Kovachki and

therefore, complex robotic manipulation will require artificial tactile
sensing. Typically tactile sensor arrays are used in robotics, implying that a
straightforward way of interpreting multidimensional data is required. In this
paper we present a simple visualisation approach based on applying principal
component analysis (PCA) to systematically collected sets of tactile data. We
apply the visualisation approach to 4 different types of tactile sensor,
encompassing fingertips and vibrissal arrays. The results show that PCA can
reveal structure and regularities in the tactile data, which also permits the
use of simple classifiers such as $k$-NN to achieve good inference.
Additionally, the Euclidean distance in principal component space gives a
measure of sensitivity, which can aid visualisation and also be used to find
regions in the tactile input space where the sensor is able to perceive with
higher accuracy. We expect that these observations will generalise, and thus
offer the potential for novel control methods based on touch.

an easy to configure and maintain resource publisher conformant to VO standards
proved to be too optimistic. For this reason it has been necessary to re-think
the architecture with a modular system built around the messaging concept,
where each modular component speaks to the other interested parties through a
system of broker-managed queues. The first implemented protocol, the Simple
Cone Search, shows the messaging task architecture connecting the parametric
HTTP interface to the database backend access module, the logging module, and
allows multiple cone search resources to be managed together through a
configuration manager module. Even if relatively young, it already proved the
flexibility required by the overall system when the database backend changed
from MySQL to PostgreSQL+PgSphere. Another implementation test has been made to
leverage task distribution over multiple servers to serve simultaneously: FITS
cubes direct linking, cubes cutout and cubes positional merging. Currently the
implementation of the SIA-2.0 standard protocol is ongoing while for TAP we
will be adapting the TAPlib library. Alongside these tools a first
administration tool (TASMAN) has been developed to ease the build up and
maintenance of TAP_SCHEMA-ta including also ObsCore maintenance capability.
Future work will be devoted at widening the range of VO protocols covered by
the set of available modules, improve the configuration management and develop
specific purpose modules common to all the service components.

However, previous work has shown that a massive, stable disc undergoing an

We compare the spiral morphology of smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations
modelling both cases. The gravitationally unstable disc produces symmetric,
tightly wound spiral arms with constant pitch angle, as predicted by the
literature. The companion disc's arms are asymmetric, with pitch angles that
increase with radius. However, these arms are not well-fitted by standard
analytic expressions, due to the high disc mass and relatively low companion
mass. We note that differences (or indeed similarities) in morphology between
pairs of spirals is a crucial discriminant between scenarios for Elias 2-27,
and hence future studies must fit spiral arms individually. If Elias 2-27
continues to show symmetric tightly wound spiral arms in future observations,
then we posit that it is the first observed example of a gravitationally
unstable protostellar disc.

density functions, which are not supported by general solutions or systematic
analysis frameworks; this significantly limits the rigour and the power of EMMs
in applications. To this end, we propose a novel general framework for
estimating and analysing the EMMs, achieved through Riemannian manifold

between the original manifold and a reformulated one indicates a mismatch
between those manifolds, the major cause of failure of the existing
optimisation for solving general EMMs. We next propose a universal solver which
is based on the optimisation of a re-designed cost and prove the existence of
the same optimum as in the original problem; this is achieved in a simple, fast
and stable way. We further calculate the influence functions of the EMM as
theoretical bounds to quantify robustness to outliers. Comprehensive numerical
results demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to accommodate EMMs
with different properties of individual functions in a stable way and with fast
convergence speed. Finally, the enhanced robustness and flexibility of the
proposed framework over the standard GMM are demonstrated both analytically and

that averages predictions from multiple other algorithms, such as generalized

develop super learning in the SAS software system using a new macro, and
demonstrate its performance relative to the R package.
  Methods: Following previous work using the R SuperLearner package we assess
the performance of super learning in a number of domains. We compare the R
package with the new SAS macro in a small set of simulations assessing curve
fitting in a predictive model as well in a set of 14 publicly available
datasets to assess cross-validated accuracy.
  Results: Across the simulated data and the publicly available data, the SAS
macro performed similarly to the R package, despite a different set of
potential algorithms available natively in R and SAS.
  Conclusions: Our super learner macro performs as well as the R package at a
number of tasks. Further, by extending the macro to include the use of R
packages, the macro can leverage both the robust, enterprise oriented
procedures in SAS and the nimble, cutting edge packages in R. In the spirit of
ensemble learning, this macro extends the potential library of algorithms
beyond a single software system and provides a simple avenue into machine

computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software
products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software,
verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs
in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other
hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving
are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive
theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties
about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq
code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona
has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona
finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell
functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell
programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with
a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a
partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work
in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the
transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination
checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey
through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like
free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof
assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their
interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally
proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona
starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell
functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the
original idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific
monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead
of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is
able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a
container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her
confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach
in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share
the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a
literate Coq file. If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming

region should only depend on the viscous scales, analogous to the Prandtl's
law-of-the-wall for the mean flow. This allows us to examine the lower bound
for the high frequency regime where law-of-the-wall in spectra would hold.
Observations in high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer data indicate
that a conservative estimate for the start of this high frequency regime is
$f^+$ = 0.005 (which corresponds to 200 viscous time-units) across a range of
wall-normal positions and Reynolds numbers. This is sufficient to capture the
energetic viscous-scaled motions such as the near-wall streaks, which has a
time scale of approximately 100 viscous units. This scaling relation and the
spectral collapse is consistent with the observations in internal flows at
lower Reynolds numbers \cite{Zamalloa2014}.

a challenge problem to accurately discriminate noise types and levels for each

parameters, and then the algorithm can automatically classify the noise
according to the different statistical parameters. The proposed variational
problem can be separated into regularization, synthesis, parameter estimation
and noise classification four steps with the operator splitting scheme. Each
step is related to an optimization subproblem. To enforce the regularization,
the deep learning method is employed to learn the natural images priori.
Compared with some model based regularizations, the CNN regularizer can
significantly improve the quality of the restored images. Compared with some
learning based methods, the synthesis step can produce better reconstructions
by analyzing the recognized noise types and levels. In our method, the

further facilitates a theoretical understanding for SPCL, instead of only

  Signals",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel kernel-based optimization scheme to handle tasks
in the analysis, e.g., signal spectral estimation and single-channel source
separation of 1D non-stationary oscillatory data. The key insight of our
optimization scheme for reconstructing the time-frequency information is that
when a nonparametric regression is applied on some input values, the output
regressed points would lie near the oscillatory pattern of the oscillatory 1D
signal only if these input values are a good approximation of the ground-truth
phase function. In this work, Gaussian Process (GP) is chosen to conduct this
nonparametric regression: the oscillatory pattern is encoded as the
Pattern-inducing Points (PiPs) which act as the training data points in the GP
regression; while the targeted phase function is fed in to compute the
correlation kernels, acting as the testing input. Better approximated phase
function generates more precise kernels, thus resulting in smaller optimization
loss error when comparing the kernel-based regression output with the original
signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that can
satisfactorily handle fully non-stationary oscillatory data, close and
crossover frequencies, and general oscillatory patterns. Even in the example of
a signal {produced by slow variation in the parameters of a trigonometric
expansion}, we show that PiPs admits competitive or better performance in terms
of accuracy and robustness than existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

detrimental to performance. But in the context of mobile robot (MR) wireless
communications, we can take advantage of the fading using a mobility diversity
algorithm (MDA) to deliberately locate the MR at a point where the channel gain
is high. There are two classes of MDAs. In the first class, the MR explores
various points, stops at each one to collect channel measurements and then
locates the best position to establish communications. In the second class the
MR moves, without stopping, along a continuous path while collecting channel
measurements and then stops at the end of the path. It determines the best
point to establish communications. Until now, the shape of the continuous path
for such MDAs has been arbitrarily selected and currently there is no method to
optimize it. In this paper, we propose a method to optimize such a path.
Simulation results show that such optimized paths provide the MDAs with an
increased performance, enabling them to experience higher channel gains while
using less mechanical energy for the MR motion.

However, we lack a fundamental understanding of its microscopic nature.
Moreover, the apparent disagreement between CDM predictions and
subgalactic-structure observations has prompted the debate about its behaviour
at small scales. These problems could be alleviated if the dark matter is
composed of ultralight fields $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$, usually known as
fuzzy dark matter (FDM). Some specific models, with axion-like potentials, have
been thoroughly studied and are collectively referred to as ultralight axions
(ULAs) or axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we consider anharmonic
corrections to the mass term coming from a repulsive quartic self-interaction.
Whenever this anharmonic term dominates, the field behaves as radiation instead
of cold matter, modifying the time of matter-radiation equality. Additionally,
even for high masses, i.e. masses that reproduce the cold matter behaviour, the
presence of anharmonic terms introduce a cut-off in the matter power spectrum
through its contribution to the sound speed. We analyze the model and derive
constraints using a modified version of CLASS and comparing with CMB and
large-scale structure data.

semantic features to progressively guide the visual features to generate an
attention map for weighting the importance of different local regions. Feeding
both the integrated visual features and the class semantic features into a

theoretically analyze in the convex and non-convex settings a generalized

stepsizes to achieve almost sure asymptotic convergence of the gradients to
zero, proving the first guarantee for generalized AdaGrad stepsizes in the
non-convex setting. Moreover, we show that these stepsizes allow to
automatically adapt to the level of noise of the stochastic gradients in both
the convex and non-convex settings, interpolating between $O(1/T)$ and
$O(1/\sqrt{T})$, up to logarithmic terms.

demonstrate the realization of well-separated Majorana zero modes. However, we
find that creating effective potential wells in the uncovered regions traps
pairs of nearby partially overlapping Majorana bound states, which become less

matching mechanism to efficiently buy and sell training data for Machine
Learning tasks. While the monetization of data and pre-trained models is an
essential focus of industry today, there does not exist a market mechanism to
price training data and match buyers to sellers while still addressing the
associated (computational and other) complexity. The challenge in creating such
a market stems from the very nature of data as an asset: (i) it is freely
replicable; (ii) its value is inherently combinatorial due to correlation with
signal in other data; (iii) prediction tasks and the value of accuracy vary
widely; (iv) usefulness of training data is difficult to verify a priori
without first applying it to a prediction task. As our main contributions we:
(i) propose a mathematical model for a two-sided data market and formally
define the key associated challenges; (ii) construct algorithms for such a
market to function and analyze how they meet the challenges defined. We
highlight two technical contributions: (i) a new notion of 'fairness' required
for cooperative games with freely replicable goods; (ii) a truthful, zero
regret mechanism to auction a class of combinatorial goods based on utilizing
Myerson's payment function and the Multiplicative Weights algorithm. These
might be of independent interest.

general, even cold reactions have many possible final product states$^{5-15}$
and reaction channels are therefore hard to track individually$^{16}$. In
special cases, however, only a single reaction channel is essentially
participating, as observed e.g. in the recombination of two atoms forming a

gradients (centres more metal-rich than their outskirts). Whereas, it is not
uncommon to observe positive metallicity gradients in higher-redshift galaxies
($z \gtrsim 0.6$). Bridging these epochs, we present gas-phase metallicity
gradients of 84 star-forming galaxies between $0.08 < z < 0.84$. Using the
galaxies with reliably determined metallicity gradients, we measure the median
metallicity gradient to be negative ($-0.039^{+0.007}_{-0.009}$ dex/kpc).
Underlying this, however, is significant scatter: $(8\pm3)\%\ [7]$ of galaxies
have significantly positive metallicity gradients, $(38 \pm 5)\%\ [32]$ have
significantly negative gradients, $(31\pm5)\%\ [26]$ have gradients consistent
with being flat. (The remaining $(23\pm5)\%\ [19]$ have unreliable gradient
estimates.) We notice a slight trend for a more negative metallicity gradient
with both increasing stellar mass and increasing star formation rate (SFR).
However, given the potential redshift and size selection effects, we do not
consider these trends to be significant. Indeed, once we normalize the SFR
relative to that of the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the
metallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This is contrary to recent studies
of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do, however, identify a novel
trend between the metallicity gradient of a galaxy and its size. Small galaxies
($r_d < 3$ kpc) present a large spread in observed metallicity gradients (both
negative and positive gradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies ($r_d
> 3$ kpc) with positive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less
scatter in the metallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. These large
(well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of present-day galaxies, which also
show a common negative metallicity gradient.

the machine learning literature contains a wealth of methods that learn
non-deep models very efficiently. In this paper, we propose to use these fast
convergent methods as the main adaptation mechanism for few-shot learning. The

solver steps. While normally the cost of the matrix operations involved in such
a process would be significant, by using the Woodbury identity we can make the
small number of examples work to our advantage. We propose both closed-form and

societies throughout the years, especially for duties related to the judicial
system, as a firewall designated to prevent illegitimate interference between
parties in a legal case and agents of the legal system. In judicial systems of
modern western countries, random procedures are mainly employed to select the
jury, the court and/or the judge in charge of judging a legal case, so that
they have a significant role in the course of a case. Therefore, these random
procedures must comply with some principles, as statistical soundness; complete
auditability; open-source programming; and procedural, cryptographical and
computational security. Nevertheless, some of these principles are neglected by
some random procedures in judicial systems, that are, in some cases, performed
in secrecy and are not auditable by the involved parts. The assignment of cases
in the Brazilian Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal) is an example of such
procedures, for it is performed by a closed-source algorithm, unknown to the
public and to the parts involved in the judicial cases, that allegedly assign
the cases randomly to the justice chairs based on their caseload.
  In this context, this article presents a review of how sortition has been
employed historically by societies, and discusses how Mathematical Statistics
may be applied to random procedures of the judicial system, as it has been
applied for almost a century on clinical trials, for example. Based on this
discussion, a statistical model for assessing randomness in case assignment is
proposed and applied to the Brazilian Supreme Court in order to shed light on
how this assignment process is performed by the closed-source algorithm.
Guidelines for random procedures are outlined and topics for further researches
presented.

physical effect in its interaction with light? Here we answer this problem by
analyzing a QED model, considering both spontaneous and stimulated emission of
quantized radiation field. For coherent radiation (Glauber state), we confirm
that stimulated emission/absorption of photons has a dependence on wavepacket
size that decays when it exceeds the interacting radiation wavelength,
consistently and complementarily with Schrodinger equation analysis of
wavepacket acceleration in classical electromagnetic field. Furthermore, the
stimulated emission of modulated electron wavepacket with coherently-bunched
profiles has characteristic harmonic emission spectrum that is also wavepacket
size dependent but beyond the frequency cut-off. In either case, there is no
wavepacket dependent emission of Fock state radiation, and particularly the
vacuum state spontaneous emission is wavepacket-independent. The transition of
radiation emission from the classical point-particle limit to the quantum
electron wavefunction limit is demonstrated in electron wavepacket
representation. It indicates a way for measuring the wavepacket size of single
electron wavefunction, and suggests a new direction for exploring light-matter
interaction fundamentally.

at signalized intersections and real-time traffic, signal timing, and weather
characteristics based on 23 signalized intersections in Central Florida. The
intersection and intersection-related crashes were collected and then divided
into two types, i.e., within intersection crashes and intersection entrance
crashes. Bayesian conditional logistic models were developed for these two
kinds of crashes, respectively. For the within intersection models, the model
results showed that the through volume from ""A"" approach (the traveling
approach of at-fault vehicle), the left turn volume from ""B"" approach
(near-side crossing approach), and the overall average flow ratio (OAFR) from
""D"" approach (far-side crossing approach), were found to have significant
positive effects on the odds of crash occurrence. Moreover, the increased
adaptability for the left turn signal timing of ""B"" approach and more priority
for ""A"" approach could significantly decrease the odds of crash occurrence. For
the intersection entrance models, average speed was found to have significant
negative effect on the odds of crash occurrence. The longer average green time
and longer average waiting time for the left turn phase, higher green ratio for
the through phase, and higher adaptability for the through phase can
significantly improve the safety performance of intersection entrance area. In
addition, the average queue length on the through lanes was found to have
positive effect on the odds of crash occurrence. These results are important in
real-time safety applications at signalized intersections in the context of
proactive traffic management.

  Online Mechanism Design","This manuscript serves as the online technical report for the paper
  published in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adaptive bitrate streaming enables video users to adapt their playing
bitrates to the real-time network conditions, hence achieving the desirable
quality-of-experience (QoE). In a multi-user wireless scenario, however,
existing single-user based bitrate adaptation methods may fail to provide the
desirable QoE, due to lack of consideration of multi-user interactions (such as
the multi-user interferences and network congestion). In this work, we propose
a novel user cooperation framework based on user-provided networking for
multi-user mobile video streaming over wireless cellular networks. The
framework enables nearby mobile video users to crowdsource their cellular links
and resources for cooperative video streaming. We first analyze the social
welfare performance bound of the proposed cooperative streaming system by
introducing a virtual time-slotted system. Then, we design a low complexity
Lyapunov-based online algorithm, which can be implemented in an online and
distributed manner without the complete future and global network information.
Numerical results show that the proposed online algorithm achieves an average
97% of the theoretical maximum social welfare. We further conduct experiments
with real data traces, to compare our proposed online algorithm with the
existing online algorithms in the literature. Experiment results show that our
algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of both the achievable
bitrate (with an average gain of 20% - 30%) and social welfare (with an average
gain of 10% - 50%).

  reduction of the latter to only Barbara, Darapti, Darii and Disamis. To the
  memory of my sister Cristina Popa, 1948-2018","31 pages, 1 figure. There are now 15 Sections",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One presents a simple Set Theory Model (STM) of the valid categorical
arguments (VCAs) - a proper superset of the valid (categorical) syllogisms
(VS). The main STM initiator was George Boole, who worked with a universe of
discourse, U, which contains the pairwise complementary sets, or categorical
terms, S, non-S, P, non-P, M, non-M, and is thus partitioned into eight
subsets: SPM, SP(non-M),...,(non-S)(non-P)(non-M), where the intersection was
denoted by adjacency. In STM all superfluous syllogistic figures are
disregarded, and both the positive terms, S, P, M, and the negative terms,
non-S, non-P, non-M, are allowed to appear in the pairs of categorical premises
(PCPs) and their entailed logical consequences (LCs). This increases the number
of distinct P (resp. S) premises from the six formulable via only positive
terms, to eight, and the number of distinct PCPs from the 36 appearing in the
Classical Categorical Syllogistic (CCS), to the 64 appearing in the STM. Out of
the latter 64 PCPs, only 32 PCPs entail LCs and thus generate VCAs. These VCAs,
(and the VS), split into four types. Each type contains eight VCAs. Any VCA can
be re-written as any other VCA of the same type, via a group G of eight
re-labelings. Thus the VCAs Barbara, Darapti, Darii, Disamis, can be chosen as
type representatives for both VCAs and VS, and via a term relabeling, any VCA
or VS can be re-written, without changing their PCP or LC contents, as either a
Barbara, Darapti, Darii, or Disamis. One discusses the VCAs and their LCs,
simple/biliteral VCA sorites, empty set constraints (ESC), VCA distribution
conservation, and other Rules of Valid Categorical Arguments (RofVCA) which are
VCA generalized versions of some of the Rules of Valid Syllogisms (RofVS). Note
that CCS restricts the VS to only LCs of the formats A(S,P), E(S,P), I(S,P),
O(S,P).

of general relativity. In the absence of fermions the spinless theory of
gravity and the theories in the standard model of particle physics are the same
Yang-Mills theories with different gauge groups. Therefore, every theorem of a
pure Yang-Mills theory is valid for the spinless theory of gravity in vacuum,
i.e. it is unitary and renormalizable to all orders. When fermions are present
the spinless theory of gravity has an extra constraint due to the tetrad
postulate. A path integral quantization of this theory and all the Feynman
rules are presented.

of electrodynamics, the maximal effective acceleration reachable by a
consistent bunch of point charged particles being accelerated by the wakefield
is damped for bunches containing large number of charged particles. We argue
that such prediction of the theory is falsifiable. In the case of Born-Infeld
kinematics, laser-plasma acceleration phenomenology provides an upper bound for
the Born-Infeld parameter $b$. Improvements in the beam qualities will imply
stronger constraints on $b$.

approach based on Gaussian Process regression which enforces equilibrium in the
method. This extension incorporates knowledge of boundary conditions, primarily
boundary tractions, into the reconstruction process. This is shown to increase
the rate of convergence and is more tolerant of systematic errors that may be
present in experimental measurements. An exact expression for a central
calculation in this method is also provided which avoids the need for the
approximation scheme that was previously used. Convergence of this method for
simulated data is compared to existing approaches and a reconstruction from
experimental data is provided. Validation of the results to conventional
constant wavelength strain measurements and comparison to prior methods shows a
significant improvement.

describing recent global fit neutrino mixing data with normal and inverted
hierarchy. The corrections to unperturbed mixing are parameterized in terms of
small orthogonal rotations (R) with modified PMNS matrix of the forms
\big($R_{\alpha\beta}^l\cdot V_{HG},~V_{HG}\cdot R_{\alpha\beta}^r,~V_{HG}\cdot
R_{\alpha\beta}^r \cdot R_{\gamma\delta}^r,~R_{\alpha\beta}^l \cdot
R_{\gamma\delta}^l \cdot V_{HG}$,~$R_{\alpha\beta}^l\cdot V_{HG}\cdot
R_{\gamma\delta}^r$\big ). Here $R_{\alpha\beta}^{l, r}$ is rotation in ij
sector and $V_{HG}$ is unperturbed Hexagonal mixing matrix. The detailed
numerical investigation of all possible cases is performed with scanning of
parameter space using $\chi^2$ approach. We found that the perturbative schemes
governed by single rotation are unable to fit the mixing angle data even at
$3\sigma$ level. The mixing schemes which involves two rotation matrices, only
\big($R_{12}^l \cdot R_{13}^l \cdot V_{HG}$, ~$R_{13}^l \cdot R_{12}^l \cdot
V_{HG}$,~$R_{13}^l \cdot V_{HG} \cdot R_{12}^r$,~$R_{12}^l \cdot V_{HG} \cdot
R_{12}^r$, ~$R_{13}^l \cdot V_{HG} \cdot R_{13}^r$\big ) are successful in
fitting all neutrino mixing angles within $1\sigma$ range for normal
hierarchy(NH). However for inverted hierarchy(IH), only $R_{13}^l \cdot V_{HG}
\cdot R_{13}^r$ is most preferable as it can fit all mixing angles at $1\sigma$
level. The remaining perturbative cases are either excluded at 3$\sigma$ level
or successful in producing mixing angles only at $2-3\sigma$ level. To study
the impact of phase parameter, we also looked into CP violating effects for
single rotation case. The predicted value of $\delta_{CP}$ lies in the range
$39.0^\circ(40.4^\circ) \le |\delta_{CP}| \le 78.7^\circ(79.2^\circ)$ for
$U_{12}^l\cdot V_{HM}$ and $U_{13}^l\cdot V_{HM}$ case with Normal(Inverted)
Hierarchy.

The channel has 3 arms and consists of nodes of the network and edges that

of the flow of the substance in the channel is discussed and statistical
distributions for the amount of substance in the nodes of the channel are
obtained. These distributions for each of the three arms of the channel contain
as particular case famous long-tail distributions such as Waring distribution,
Yule-Simon distribution and Zipf distribution. The obtained results are
discussed from the point of view of technological applications of the model
(e.g., the motion of the substance is considered to happen in a complex
technological system and the obtained analytical relationships for the
distribution of the substance in the nodes of the channel represents the
distribution of the substance in the corresponding cells of the technological
chains). A possible application of the obtained results for description of
human migration in migration channels is discussed too.
