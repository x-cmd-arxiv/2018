promising solution-processable materials for photovoltaic (PV) and other
optoelectronic devices. HOIPs represent a broad family of materials with
properties highly tuneable by the ions that make up the perovskite structure as
well as their multiple combinations. Interestingly, recent high-efficiency PV
devices using HOIPs with substantially improved long-term stability have used
combinations of different ionic compositions. The structural dynamics of these
systems are unique for semiconducting materials and are currently argued to be
central to HOIPs stability and charge-transport properties. Here, we studied
the impact of ionic composition on phonon speeds of HOIPs from Brillouin
spectroscopy experiments and density functional theory calculations for
FAPbBr$_3$, MAPbBr$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, and the mixed halide
MAPbBr$_{1.25}$Cl$_{1.75}$. Our results show that the acoustic phonon speeds
can be strongly modified by ionic composition, which we explain by analysing
the lead-halide sublattice in detail. The vibrational properties of HOIPs are
therefore tuneable by using targeted ionic compositions in the perovskite
structure. This tuning can be rationalized with non-trivial effects, for
example, considering the influence of the shape and dipole moment of organic
cations. This has an important implication to further improvements in the
stability and charge-transport properties of these systems.

$K$-band light variation into two parts originating from the temperature and
the radius changes using synthetic data of atmosphere-model grids. The
amplitudes of the temperature and the radius variations derived from the method
for non-Blazhko RRab stars are in very good agreement with the results of the
Baade-Wesselink analysis of RRab stars in the M3 globular cluster confirming
the applicability and correctness of the method. It has been found that the
Blazhko modulation is primarily driven by the change in the temperature
variation. The radius variation plays a marginal part, moreover it has an
opposite sign as if the Blazhko effect was caused by the radii variations. This
result reinforces the previous finding based on the Baade-Wesselink analysis of
M3 (NGC 5272) RR Lyrae, that significant modulation of the radius variations
can only be detected in radial-velocity measurements, which relies on spectral

Spaces provide a mathematically compelling and practically competitive
framework for learning from data.
  In this paper we take the approximation theory point of view to explore
various aspects of smooth kernels related to their inferential properties. We
analyze eigenvalue decay of kernels operators and matrices, properties of
eigenfunctions/eigenvectors and ""Fourier"" coefficients of functions in the
kernel space restricted to a discrete set of data points. We also investigate
the fitting capacity of kernels, giving explicit bounds on the fat shattering
dimension of the balls in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces. Interestingly, the
same properties that make kernels very effective approximators for functions in
their ""native"" kernel space, also limit their capacity to represent arbitrary
functions. We discuss various implications, including those for gradient
descent type methods.
  It is important to note that most of our bounds are measure independent.
Moreover, at least in moderate dimension, the bounds for eigenvalues are much
tighter than the bounds which can be obtained from the usual matrix
concentration results. For example, we see that the eigenvalues of kernel
matrices show nearly exponential decay with constants depending only on the
kernel and the domain. We call this ""approximation beats concentration""
phenomenon as even when the data are sampled from a probability distribution,
some of their aspects are better understood in terms of approximation theory.

Considerable enhancement of the electron-electron interaction may be expected
in such metamaterial scenarios as in epsilon near zero (ENZ) and hyperbolic
metamaterials. In both cases dielectric function may become small and negative
in substantial portions of the relevant four-momentum space, leading to
enhancement of the electron pairing interaction. This approach has been
verified in experiments with aluminium-based metamaterials. Metamaterial
superconductor with Tc = 3.9 K have been fabricated, that is three times that
of pure aluminium (Tc = 1.2 K), which opens up new possibilities to
considerably improve Tc of other simple superconductors. Taking advantage of
the demonstrated success of this approach, the critical temperature of
hypothetic niobium, MgB2 and H2S-based metamaterial superconductors is
evaluated. The MgB2-based metamaterial superconductors are projected to reach

promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes. Their topological
properties are controlled by the band alignment of the two materials, as well
as the electrostatic environment, which are currently not well understood.
Here, we pursue to fill in this gap and address the role of band bending and
superconductor-semiconductor hybridization in such devices by analyzing a gated
single Al-InAs interface using a self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson approach.
Our numerical analysis shows that the band bending leads to an interface
quantum well, which localizes the charge in the system near the
superconductor-semiconductor interface. We investigate the hybrid band
structure and analyze its response to varying the gate voltage and thickness of
the Al layer. This is done by studying the hybridization degrees of the
individual subbands, which determine the induced pairing and effective
$g$-factors. The numerical results are backed by approximate analytical
expressions which further clarify key aspects of the band structure. We find
that one can obtain states with strong superconductor-semiconductor
hybridization at the Fermi energy, but this requires a fine balance of
parameters, with the most important constraint being on the width of the Al
layer. In fact, in the regime of interest, we find an almost periodic
dependence of the hybridization degree on the Al width, with a period roughly
equal to the thickness of an Al monolayer. This implies that disorder and shape
irregularities, present in realistic devices, may play an important role for
averaging out this sensitivity and, thus, may be necessary for stabilizing the
topological phase.

formation theories. However, confirmed DAGN are rare and finding these systems
has proved to be challenging. Recent systematic searches for DAGN using
double-peaked emission lines have yielded several new detections. As have the
studies of samples of merging galaxies. In this paper, we present an updated
list of DAGN compiled from published data. We also present preliminary results
from our ongoing Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) radio study of eight double-
peaked emission-line AGN (DPAGN). One of the sample galaxy shows an S-shaped
radio jet. Using new and archival data, we have successfully fitted a
precessing jet model to this radio source. We find that the jet precession
could be due to a binary AGN with a super-massive black-hole (SMBH) separation
of 0.02 pc or a single AGN with a tilted accretion disk. We have found that
another sample galaxy, which is undergoing a merger, has two radio cores with a
projected separation of 5.6 kpc. We discuss the preliminary results from our
radio study.

  preparation and sensing","11 pages, 6 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A quantum metrology protocol for parameter estimation is typically comprised
of three stages: probe state preparation, sensing and then readout, where the
time required for the first and last stages is usually neglected. In the
present work we consider non-negligible state preparation and readout times,
and the tradeoffs in sensitivity that come when a limited time resource $\tau$
must be divided between the three stages. To investigate this, we focus on the
problem of magnetic field sensing with spins in one-axis twisted or two-axis
twisted states. We find that (accounting for the time necessary to prepare a
twisted state) by including entanglement, which is introduced via the twisting,
no advantage is gained unless the time $\tau$ is sufficiently long or the
twisting sufficiently strong. However, we also find that the limited time
resource is used more effectively if we allow the twisting and the magnetic
field to be applied concurrently which is representative of a more realistic
sensing scenario. We extend this result into the optical regime by utilizing
the exact correspondence between a spin system and a bosonic field mode as
given by the Holstein-Primakoff transformation.

conjunction. In order to investigate this idea while enabling systematic
visualization and quantification of multiple filter responses, we introduce the
Net2Vec framework, in which semantic concepts are mapped to vectorial
embeddings based on corresponding filter responses. By studying such
embeddings, we are able to show that 1., in most cases, multiple filters are
required to code for a concept, that 2., often filters are not concept specific
and help encode multiple concepts, and that 3., compared to single filter
activations, filter embeddings are able to better characterize the meaning of a
representation and its relationship to other concepts.

the millimeter windows between 72 and 272 GHz permitted the detection of

protostellar shock region). In the shock, analysis of the line profiles shows
that the emission arises from the outflow cavities associated with L1157-B1 and
L1157-B2. Molecular abundances and excitation conditions were obtained from
analysis of the Spectral Line Energy Distributions under the assumption of
Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium or using a radiative transfer code in the
Large Velocity Gradient approximation. Towards L1157mm, the HC$_3$N emission
arises from the cold envelope ($T_{rot}=10$ K) and a higher-excitation region
($T_{rot}$= $31$ K) of smaller extent around the protostar. We did not find any
evidence of $^{13}$C or D fractionation enrichment towards L1157-B1. We obtain
a relative abundance ratio HC$_3$N/HC$_5$N of 3.3 in the shocked gas. We find
an increase by a factor of 30 of the HC$_3$N abundance between the envelope of

with a scenario in which the bulk of HC$_3$N was produced by means of gas phase
reactions in the passage of the shock. This scenario is supported by the
predictions of a parametric shock code coupled with the chemical model

to include an edge into the matching or to exclude it, under the restriction
that at most $k$ such actions per edge take place, where $k$ is typically a

general online packing problems with recourse by Avitabile et al. [Information

  In the first part of this paper we consider the edge arrival model, in which
an arriving edge never disappears from the graph. Here, we first show an
improved analysis on the performance of the algorithm AMP of Avitabile et al.,
by exploiting the structure of the matching problem. In addition, we show that
the greedy algorithm has competitive ratio $3/2$ for every even $k$ and ratio
$2$ for every odd $k$. Moreover, we present and analyze an improvement of the
greedy algorithm which we call $L$-Greedy, and we show that for small values of
$k$ it outperforms the algorithm AMP. In terms of lower bounds, we show that no
deterministic algorithm better than $1+1/(k-1)$ exists, improving upon the
known lower bound of $1+1/k$.
  The second part of the paper is devoted to the edge arrival/departure model,
which is the fully dynamic variant of online matching with recourse. The
analysis of $L$-Greedy and AMP carry through in this model; moreover we show a
lower bound of $(k^2-3k+6) / (k^2-4k+7)$ for all even $k \ge 4$. For
$k\in\{2,3\}$, the competitive ratio is $3/2$.

allowing some nilpotent (or, more precisely: solvable) internal symmetries in
addition. Due to the presence of this nilpotent part, the prohibitive argument
of the well known Coleman-Mandula and McGlinn no-go theorems do not go through.
In contrast to SUSY or extended SUSY, in our construction the symmetries
extending the Poincar\'e group will be all internal, i.e. they do not act on
the spacetime, merely on some internal degrees of freedom -- hence the name:
conservative extensions of the Poincar\'e group. Using the Levi decomposition
and O'Raifeartaigh theorem, the general structure of all possible conservative
extensions of the Poincar\'e group is outlined, and a concrete example group is
presented with U(1) being the compact gauge group component. It is argued that
such nilpotent internal symmetries may be inapparent symmetries of some more
fundamental field variables, and therefore do not carry an ab initio
contradiction with the present experimental understanding in particle physics.
The construction is compared to (extended) SUSY, since SUSY is somewhat
analogous to the proposed mechanism. It is pointed out, however, that the
proposed mechanism is less irregular in comparison to SUSY, in certain aspects.
The only exoticity needed in comparison to a traditional gauge theory setting
is that the full group of internal symmetries is not purely compact, but is a
semi-direct product of a nilpotent and of a compact part.

been used in numerical modeling and remote sensing retrieval studies of clouds
and precipitation, including exponential, gamma, lognormal, and Weibull
distributions. However, there is no satisfying physical explanation as to why
certain distribution forms preferentially occur instead of others.
Theoretically, the analytical form of a PSD can be derived by directly solving
the general dynamic equation, but no analytical solutions have been found yet.
Instead of a process level approach, the use of the principle of maximum
entropy (MaxEnt) for determining the analytical form of PSDs from the
perspective of system is examined here. MaxEnt theory states that the
probability density function with the largest information entropy among a group
satisfying the given properties of the variable should be chosen. Here, the
issue of variability under coordinate transformations that arises using the
Gibbs/Shannon definition of entropy is identified, and the use of the concept
of relative entropy to avoid these problems is discussed. Focusing on cloud
physics, the four-parameter generalized gamma distribution is proposed as the

radius. Schlieren imaging is proposed to determine the plasma radius on both

column of excited rubidium atoms. A tunable, narrow bandwidth laser is split
into a beam for the excitation of the rubidium vapor and for the visualization
using Schlieren imaging. With a laser wavelength very close to the D2

understanding many key features of disk evolution and planet formation, from
disk chemistry and dynamics, to planetesimal formation. This paper explores the
techniques available to determine temperatures from observations of single,
optically thick molecular emission lines. Specific attention is given to issues
such as inclusion of optically thin emission, problems resulting from continuum
subtraction, and complications of real observations. Effort is also made to
detail the exact nature and morphology of the region emitting a given line. To
properly study and quantify these effects, this paper considers a range of disk
models, from simple pedagogical models, to very detailed models including full
radiative transfer. Finally, we show how use of the wrong methods can lead to
potentially severe misinterpretations of data, leading to incorrect
measurements of disk temperature profiles. We show that the best way to
estimate the temperature of emitting gas is to analyze the line peak emission
map without subtracting continuum emission. Continuum subtraction, which is
commonly applied to observations of line emission, systematically leads to
underestimation of the gas temperature. We further show that once observational
effects such as beam dilution and noise are accounted for, the line brightness
temperature derived from the peak emission is reliably within 10-15% of the
physical temperature of the emitting region, assuming optically thick emission.
The methodology described in this paper will be applied in future works to
constrain the temperature, and related physical quantities, in protoplanetary
disks observed with ALMA.

materials: called miamagnetism. As we know, we have several forms of
magnetization: the diamagnetism, the paramagnetism, the ferromagnetism etc. The
main character of the diamagnetism is that its magnetic susceptibility is
negative (from -1e-9 for gas and -1e-6 for liquid and solid to -1 for
superconducting materials of type I) and it is not less than -1 unless for
special materials like metamaterials at high frequencies. The miamagnetism has
the character that the magnetic susceptibility can reach at low frequencies a
negative value of -155 of magnitude leading to a negative permeability. We can
not see it because it is hidden by the ferromagnetic character which has a high
positive magnetic susceptibility. We use the discrete Fourier transform to
illustrate this hidden character and the hysteresis model can be represented
only by harmonics of (2n+1)f0 of magnitude. This magnetization follows a
Boltzmann distribution for the modulus of theses harmonics.

as a set. In decisions in the field or in the lab, however, agents do not have
access to the set of alternatives at once. Instead, alternatives are
represented by the outside world in a structured way. Online search results are
lists of items, wine menus are often lists of lists (grouped by type or
country), and online shopping often involves filtering items which can be
viewed as navigating a tree. Representations constrain how an agent can choose.
At the same time, an agent can also leverage representations when choosing,
simplifying his/her choice process. For instance, in the case of a list he or
she can use the order in which alternatives are represented to make his/her
choice.
  In this paper, we model representations and decision procedures operating on
them. We show that choice procedures are related to classical choice functions
by a canonical mapping. Using this mapping, we can ask whether properties of
choice functions can be lifted onto the choice procedures which induce them. We
focus on the obvious benchmark: rational choice. We fully characterize choice
procedures which can be rationalized by a strict preference relation for
general representations including lists, list of lists, trees and others. Our
framework can thereby be used as the basis for new tests of rational behavior.
  Classical choice theory operates on very limited information, typically
budgets or menus and final choices. This is in stark contrast to the vast
amount of data that specifically web companies collect about their users'
choice process. Our framework offers a way to integrate such data into economic
choice models.

flares can provide important information regarding the flare triggering and
back reaction processes. However, such studies on the flow field are rare due
to the paucity of high-resolution observations covering the entire flaring
period. Here we study the structural evolution of penumbra and shear flows
associated with the 2015 June 22 M6.5 flare in NOAA AR 12371, using
high-resolution imaging observation in the TiO band taken by the 1.6~m Goode
Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory, with the aid of the differential
affine velocity estimator method for flow tracking. The accompanied
photospheric vector magnetic field changes are also analyzed using data from
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. As a result, we found, for a penumbral
segment in the negative field adjacent to the magnetic polarity inversion line
(PIL), an enhancement of penumbral flows (up to an unusually high value of
\sm2~\kms) and extension of penumbral fibrils after the first peak of the flare
hard X-ray (HXR) emission. We also found an area at the PIL, which is
co-spatial with a precursor brightening kernel, exhibits a gradual increase of
shear flow velocity (up to \sm0.9~\kms) after the flare. The enhancing
penumbral and shear flow regions are also accompanied by an increase of
horizontal field and decrease of magnetic inclination angle(measured from the
solar surface). These results are discussed in the context of the theory of
back reaction of coronal restructuring on the photosphere as a result of flare
energy release.

essential for understanding how solar eruptions affect the radiation
environment of near-Earth space. SEP propagation is influenced by turbulent
magnetic fields in the solar wind, resulting in stochastic transport of SEPs to
Earth. Multi-spacecraft observations suggest that the cross-field propagation
shapes the SEP fluxes at Earth strongly. However, modelling SEP cross-field
transport as spatial diffusion has been shown to be insufficient without use of
unrealistically large cross-field diffusion coefficients. Recent work has shown
that the early-time propagation of energetic particles across the mean field
direction in turbulent fields is not diffusive, as the particles propagating
along meandering field lines. This early-time transport mode results in fast
access of the particles across the mean field direction, in agreement with the
SEP observations. In this work, we demonstrate the significance of turbulence
strength on evolution of the SEP radiation environment near Earth. We calculate
the transport parameters with a turbulence transport model, parametrised by the
SEP parallel scattering mean free path at 1~AU, $\lambda_{\parallel}^{*}$, and
show that the parallel and cross-field transport are connected, with conditions
resulting in slow parallel transport corresponding to wider events. We find a
scaling $\sigma_{\phi,\, \mathrm{max}}\propto
(1/\lambda_{\parallel}^{*})^{1/4}$ for the Gaussian fitting of the longitudinal
distribution of maximum intensities. The longitudes with highest intensities
are shifted towards the west for strong scattering conditions. Our results
emphasise the importance of understanding both the SEP transport and the
interplanetary turbulence conditions for modelling and predicting the SEP

challenging due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of

transmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial noises, and repeats
such transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter
uses delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net
interference and artificial noises (generated in previous phase), which is
simultaneously useful for all receivers. These phases are designed to ensure
the decodability of the desired messages while satisfying the secrecy
constraints. We present our achievable scheme for three models, namely: 1)

Astrophysics code. We show that most stars develop enhancements in nitrogen
($^{14}$N) and depletions in carbon ($^{12}$C) and oxygen ($^{16}$O) over their
lifetimes, and that these features are more pronounced for higher mass stars.
We find that, in an accretion-powered tidal disruption flare, these features
become prominent only after the time of peak of the fallback rate and appear at
earlier times for stars of increasing mass. We postulate that no severe
compositional changes resulting from the fallback material should be expected
near peak for a wide range of stellar masses and, as such, are unable to
explain the extreme helium-to-hydrogen line ratios observed in some TDEs. On
the other hand, the resulting compositional changes could help explain the
presence of nitrogen-rich features, which are currently only detected after
peak. When combined with the shape of the light curve, the time evolution of
the composition of the fallback material provides a clear method to help
constrain the nature of the disrupted star. This will enable a better
characterization of the event by helping break the degeneracy between the mass
of the star and the mass of the black hole when fitting tidal disruption light

galaxies which will fall into a cluster by z=0 show a ~0.05 dex enhancement in
the MZR compared to field galaxies at z<0.5. Based on the inflow rate of gas
into cluster galaxies and its metallicity, we identify that the accretion of

particularly in the stellar mass range (10^9< M_star<10^10 M_sun). We see
signatures of an environmental dependence of the ambient/inflowing gas

correction factors to account for the inclination dependence of the parameters

wavelengths at both redshifts and that the FIR and radio emission is also
transparent as expected. However, reduced sensitivity at these wavelengths
limits our analysis; we cannot rule out opacity in the FIR or radio.
Ultra-violet attenuation has increased between $z\sim0$ and $z\sim0.7$, with
the $z\sim0.7$ sample being a factor of $\sim$3.4 more attenuated. The larger
UV attenuation at $z\sim0.7$ can be explained by more clumpy dust around

shorter than one day. Their origin is still unknown, with photo-evaporation of
mini-Neptunes and in-situ formation being the most credited hypotheses.
Formation scenarios differ radically in the predicted composition of USP
planets, it is therefore extremely important to increase the still limited
sample of USP planets with precise and accurate mass and density measurements.
We report here the characterization of an USP planet with a period of 0.28 days
around K2-141 (EPIC 246393474), and the validation of an outer planet with a
period of 7.7 days in a grazing transit configuration. We derived the radii of
the planets from the K2 light curve and used high-precision radial velocities
gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph for mass measurements. For K2-141b we
thus inferred a radius of $1.51\pm0.05~R_\oplus$ and a mass of
$5.08\pm0.41~M_\oplus$, consistent with a rocky composition and lack of a thick
atmosphere. K2-141c is likely a Neptune-like planet, although due to the
grazing transits and the non-detection in the RV dataset, we were not able to
put a strong constraint on its density. We also report the detection of
secondary eclipses and phase curve variations for K2-141b. The phase variation
can be modeled either by a planet with a geometric albedo of $0.30 \pm 0.06$ in
the Kepler bandpass, or by thermal emission from the surface of the planet at
$\sim$3000K. Only follow-up observations at longer wavelengths will allow us to
distinguish between these two scenarios.

landscape of string vacua and the (likely) very large underlying string scale
imply that they may never be tested directly. Nevertheless, concrete
constructions consistent with the observed world frequently lead to observable
remnants, i.e., new particles or features that are apparently accidental
consequences of the ultraviolet theory and that are typically not motivated by
specific shortcomings of the standard models of particle physics or cosmology.
For example, moduli, axions, large extended gauge sectors, additional $Z'$
gauge bosons, extended Higgs/Higgsino sectors, and quasi-chiral exotics are
extremely common. They motivate alternative cosmological paradigms and could
lead to observable signatures at the LHC. Similar features can emerge in other
standard model extensions, but in the stringy case they are more likely to
occur in isolation and not as part of a more complete TeV-scale structure.
Conversely, some common aspects of the infinite ""landscape"" of field theories,
such as large representations, are expected to be very rare in the string
landscape, and observation of features definitively in the swampland could lead
to falsification. In this article, common stringy remnants and their
phenomenology are surveyed, and implications for indirectly supporting or
casting doubt on string theory are discussed.

wide compact object binaries are most affected by the third object, resulting
in a strong increase (by more than a factor of 2) in the fraction of fast
coalescences. If instead the distribution preferentially populates very close
compact binaries, general relativistic precession prevents the third body from
increasing the inner binary eccentricity to very high values. In this last
case, the fraction of coalescing binaries is increased much less by tertiaries,

this correspondence with a suite of numerical test problems in 1D, 2D, and 3D

density field of the superfluid always shows order unity oscillations as
$\hbar/m\to 0$ due to interference and the uncertainty principle, the potential

coupled to the superfluid potential is expected to recover the classical
collisionless limit as $\hbar/m\to 0$. The quantum superfluid is able to
capture rich phenomena such as multiple phase-sheets, shell-crossings, and warm
distributions. Additionally, the quantum pressure tensor acts as a regularizer
of caustics and singularities in classical solutions. This suggests the
exciting prospect of using the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations as a low-memory

the evolution of surrounding protoplanetary discs (PPDs) due to either
photoevaporation or tidal truncation. Consequently, the development of planets
depends on formation environment. Here we present the first thorough
investigation of tidally induced angular momentum loss in PPDs in the distant
regime, partly motivated by claims in the literature for the importance of
distant encounters in disc evolution. We employ both theoretical predictions
and dynamical/hydrodynamical simulations in 2D and 3D. Our theoretical analysis
is based on that of Ostriker (1994) and leads us to conclude that in the limit
that the closest approach distance $x_{min} \gg r$, the radius of a particle
ring, the fractional change in angular momentum scales as $(x_{min}/r)^{-5}$.
This asymptotic limit ensures that the cumulative effect of distant encounters
is minor in terms of its influence on disc evolution. The angular momentum
transfer is dominated by the $m=2$ Lindblad resonance for closer encounters and
by the $m=1$, $\omega = 0$ Lindblad resonance at large $x_{min}/r$. We
contextualise these results by comparing expected angular momentum loss for the
outer edge of a PPD due to distant and close encounters. Contrary to the
suggestions of previous works we do not find that distant encounters contribute
significantly to angular momentum loss in PPDs. We define an upper limit for
closest approach distance where interactions are significant as a function of
arbitrary host to perturber mass ratio $M_2/M_1$.

15 kpc of the galaxy is distributed in a complex warped disk. In the outer
parts of this disk, the CO gas follows the rotation of the dust lane and of the
stellar body of the galaxy hosting the radio source. In the innermost
kiloparsec, the gas abruptly changes orientation and forms a circumnuclear disk
($r\lesssim700$ pc) with its major axis perpendicular to that of the outer
disk. Against the compact radio emission of PKS B1718-649 ($r\sim 2$ pc), we
detect an absorption line at red-shifted velocities with respect to the
systemic velocity ($\Delta v = +365\pm22$\kms). This absorbing CO gas could
trace molecular clouds falling onto the central super-massive black hole. A
comparison with the near-infra red H$_{\,2}$ 1-0 S(1) observations shows that
the clouds must be close to the black hole ($r\lesssim 75$ pc). The physical
conditions of these clouds are different from the gas at larger radii, and are
in good agreement with the predictions for the conditions of the gas when cold
chaotic accretion triggers an active galactic nucleus. These observations on

dispersion of the GC system scale up weakly with galaxy mass. The metallicity
of massive, metal-poor (""blue"") clusters increases with cluster mass, while
that of metal-rich (""red"") clusters does not. A significant age-metallicity
relation emerges from analysis of resolved stellar populations in Galactic GCs
and unresolved populations in nearby galaxies. Remarkably, all these trends can
be explained by a simple merger-based model developed in previous work and
updated here using recent observations of galaxy scaling relations at high
redshift. We show that the increasing dispersion of GC metallicity
distributions with galaxy mass is a robust prediction of the model. It arises
from more massive galaxies having more mergers that combine satellite GC
systems. The average metallicity also increases by 0.6~dex over 3~dex in halo
mass. The models show a non-linear trend between the GC system mass and host
galaxy mass which is consistent with the data. The model does not consider GC
self-enrichment, yet predicts a correlation between cluster mass and
metallicity for massive blue clusters. The age-metallicity relation is another
robust prediction of the model. Half of all clusters are predicted to form
within the redshift range $5<z<2.3$, corresponding to ages of $10.8-12.5$~Gyr,

factorization of the Hilbert space. We reproduce the answer expected from an
effective field theory point of view, namely a sum over the one-loop
entanglement entropies corresponding to all the particle-excitations of the

divergences in the entanglement entropy. We then revisit the question of
factorization of the Hilbert space by analyzing the covariant phase-space

that the pure gauge (i.e., BRST exact) modes in the string field become
dynamical at the entanglement cut. Thus, a proper definition of the entropy

structure of molecular gas at high resolution and low metallicity. We present
results from the Herschel Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (HS$^{3}$), which
mapped the key far-IR cooling lines [CII], [OI], [NII], and [OIII] in five
star-forming regions, and new ALMA 7m-array maps of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO
$(2-1)$ with coverage overlapping four of the five HS$^{3}$ regions. We detect
[CII] and [OI] throughout all of the regions mapped. The data allow us to
compare the structure of the molecular clouds and surrounding photodissociation
regions using $^{13}$CO, CO, [CII], and [OI] emission at $<10$"" ($<3$ pc)
scales. We estimate Av using far-IR thermal continuum emission from dust and
find the CO/[CII] ratios reach the Milky Way value at high A$_{V}$ in the
centers of the clouds and fall to $\sim{1/5-1/10}\times$ the Milky Way value in
the outskirts, indicating the presence of translucent molecular gas not traced
by bright CO emission. We estimate the amount of molecular gas traced by bright
[CII] emission at low A$_{V}$ and bright CO emission at high A$_{V}$. We find
that most of the molecular gas is at low A$_{V}$ and traced by bright [CII]
emission, but that faint CO emission appears to extend to where we estimate the
H$_{2}$-to-HI transition occurs. By converting our H$_{2}$ gas estimates to a
CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor ($X_{CO}$), we show that $X_{CO}$ is primarily
a function of A$_{V}$, consistent with simulations and models of low
metallicity molecular clouds.

different radio morphologies, with F-NLS1s being more compact, and RQNLS1s
often showing diffuse emission on kpc scales. We also find that F-NLS1s might
be low-luminosity and possibly young blazars, and that S-NLS1s are part of the

while minimizing costs and capturing their dependencies on the associated

introduces the Optimal Resilient Design Problem for Distribution and Communi-

two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program that captures the physical laws of
distribution systems, the communication connec- tivity of the smart grid
components, and a set of scenarios which specifies which components are
affected by potential disasters. The paper proposes an exact branch-and-price
algorithm for the ORDPDC which features a strong lower bound and a variety of
acceleration schemes to address degeneracy. The ORDPDC model and
branch-and-price algorithm were evaluated on a variety of test cases with
varying disaster inten- sities and network topologies. The results demonstrate
the significant impact of the network topologies on the expansion plans and
costs, as well as the computational benefits of the proposed approach.

possibility of jet chemical enrichement by the wind, and the characteristic
signatures of such a configuration. We have constructed an analytic model of a
jet bow shock driven into a surrounding slower disk wind in the thin shell
approximation. The refilling of the post bow shock cavity from below by the
disk wind is also studied. An extension of the model to the case of two or more
successive internal working surfaces (IWS) is made. We then compared this
analytic model with numerical simulations with and without a surrounding disk
wind. We find that at early times (of order the variability period), jet bow
shocks travel in refilled pristine disk-wind material, before interacting with
the cocoon of older bow shocks. This opens the possibility of bow shock
chemical enrichment (if the disk wind is molecular and dusty) and of probing
the unperturbed disk wind structure near the jet base. Several distinctive
signatures of the presence of a surrounding disk wind are identified, in the
bow shock morphology and kinematics. Numerical simulations validate our
analytical approach and further show that at large scale, the passage of many
jet IWS inside a disk wind produces a stationary V-shaped cavity, closing down
onto the axis at a finite distance from the source.

most straightforward approach to this algorithmic step estimates each component

several techniques to accelerate and improve practical applications for quantum

tensor imaging (CDTI) by integrating low-rankness and compressed sensing.
Methods: Diffusion-weighted images exhibit both transform sparsity and
low-rankness. These properties can jointly be exploited to accelerate CDTI,
especially when a phase map is applied to correct for the phase inconsistency
across diffusion directions, thereby enhancing low-rankness. The proposed
method is evaluated both ex vivo and in vivo, and is compared to methods using
either a low-rank or sparsity constraint alone. Results: Compared to using a
low-rank or sparsity constraint alone, the proposed method preserves more
accurate helix angle features, the transmural continuum across the myocardium
wall, and mean diffusivity at higher acceleration, while yielding significantly
lower bias and higher intraclass correlation coefficient. Conclusion:
Low-rankness and compressed sensing together facilitate acceleration for both
ex vivo and in vivo CDTI, improving reconstruction accuracy compared to
employing either constraint alone. Significance: Compared to previous methods
for accelerating CDTI, the proposed method has the potential to reach higher
acceleration while preserving myofiber architecture features which may allow
more spatial coverage, higher spatial resolution and shorter temporal footprint
in the future.

the cooling frequency $\nu_c$ is above the X-ray band and the synchrotron

extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise
measurement of the index $p$ of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic
electrons $N(\gamma)\propto \gamma^{-p}$ accelerated by a shock launched by a
NS-NS merger to date. We find $p=2.17\pm0.01$, which indicates that radiation
from ejecta with $\Gamma\sim3-10$ dominates the observed emission. While
constraining the nature of the emission process, these observations do
\emph{not} constrain the nature of the relativistic ejecta. We employ
simulations of explosive outflows launched in NS ejecta clouds to show that the
spectral and temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission from GW170817 is
consistent with both emission from radially stratified quasi-spherical ejecta
traveling at mildly relativistic speeds, \emph{and} emission from off-axis
collimated ejecta characterized by a narrow cone of ultra-relativistic material

harbored a normal SGRB directed away from our line of sight. Observations at

uncertainty. Another four sources, two disks and two protostars, show
moderately-enhanced standard deviations in brightness, as expected for
stochastic variables. For the two protostars, this apparent variability is the
result of single epochs that are much brighter than the mean. In our search for
secular brightness variations that are linear in time, we measure the
fractional brightness change per year for 150 bright peaks, fifty of which are
protostellar. The ensemble distribution of slopes is well fit by a normal
distribution with sigma ~ 0.023. Most sources are not rapidly brightening or
fading in the sub-mm. Comparison against time-randomized realizations shows
that the width of the distribution is dominated by the uncertainty in the
individual brightness measurements of the sources. A toy model for secular
variability reveals that an underlying Gaussian distribution of linear
fractional brightness change sigma = 0.005 would be unobservable in the present
sample, whereas an underlying distribution with sigma = 0.02 is ruled out. Five

hollow jet in M87 with a forked morphology. The detailed analysis presented
here indicates that the spectral luminosity of the central spine of the jet in
M87 is a few percent of that of the surrounding hollow jet $200 -400
\mu\rm{as}$ from the central black hole. Furthermore, recent jet models in
indicate that a hollow ""tubular"" jet can explain a wide range of plausible
broadband spectra originating from jetted plasma located within $\sim
30\mu\rm{as}$ of the central black hole, including the 230 GHz correlated flux
detected by the Event Horizon Telescope. Most importantly, these hollow jets
from the inner accretion flow have an intrinsic power capable of energizing the
global jet out to kiloparsec scales. Thus motivated, this paper considers new
models of the event horizon magnetosphere (EHM) in low luminosity accretion
systems. Contrary to some models, the spine is not an invisible powerful jet.
It is an intrinsically weak jet. In the new EHM solution, the accreted poloidal
magnetic flux is weak and the background photon field is weak. It is shown how
this accretion scenario naturally results in the dissipation of the accreted
poloidal magnetic flux in the EHM not the accumulation of poloidal flux

Initially
defined via an interactive protocol, quantum colorings can also be viewed as a
natural operator relaxation of graph coloring. Since there is no known
algorithm for producing nontrivial quantum colorings, the existing examples
rely on ad hoc constructions. Almost all of the known constructions of quantum
$d$-colorings start from $d$-dimensional orthogonal representations. We show
the limitations of this method by exhibiting, for the first time, a graph with
a 3-dimensional orthogonal representation which cannot be quantum 3-colored,
and a graph that can be quantum 3-colored but has no 3-dimensional orthogonal
representation. Together these examples show that the quantum chromatic number
and orthogonal rank are not directly comparable as graph parameters. The former
graph also provides an example of several interesting, and previously unknown,
properties of quantum colorings. The most striking of these is that adding a
new vertex adjacent to all other vertices does not necessarily increase the
quantum chromatic number of a graph. This is in stark contrast to the chromatic
number and many of its variants. This graph also provides the smallest known
example (14 vertices) exhibiting a separation between chromatic number and its
quantum analog.

SPLITFACE, a deep convolutional neural network-based method that is explicitly
designed to perform attribute detection in partially occluded faces. Taking
several facial segments and the full face as input, the proposed method takes a
data driven approach to determine which attributes are localized in which
facial segments. The unique architecture of the network allows each attribute
to be predicted by multiple segments, which permits the implementation of
committee machine techniques for combining local and global decisions to boost
performance. With access to segment-based predictions, SPLITFACE can predict
well those attributes which are localized in the visible parts of the face,
without having to rely on the presence of the whole face. We use the CelebA and
LFWA facial attribute datasets for standard evaluations. We also modify both
datasets, to occlude the faces, so that we can evaluate the performance of
attribute detection algorithms on partial faces. Our evaluation shows that
SPLITFACE significantly outperforms other recent methods especially for partial

interest in the design of random multiple access schemes for networks with

are enhancements to slotted ALOHA. One of the popular schemes, irregular
repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA), is based on an analogy between multiple access
with successive interference cancellation and message-passing decoding on
bipartite graphs. Most of the results on IRSA and its variants focus on the
collision channel and they ignore physical limitations such as transmit power
constraints and additive Gaussian noise at the physical layer. As such, naive
extensions of IRSA to the Gaussian multiple access channel are not power

novel paradigm whereby devices adapt their rates and/or transmit powers based

substantial improvements in terms of power efficiency and average rate over

model components from a range of options giving users substantial flexibility,
including: accelerated failure time or proportional hazards regression models;
parametric or non-parametric specifications for baseline survival functions;
parametric or non-parametric specifications for random effects distributions
when the data are cluster-correlated; and, a Markov or semi-Markov
specification for terminal event following non-terminal event. While estimation
is mainly performed within the Bayesian paradigm, the package also provides the
maximum likelihood estimation for select parametric models. The package also
includes functions for univariate survival analysis as complementary analysis
tools.

luminous sources in the universe. But the standard MRI under a purely vertical
magnetic field has heretofore never been directly measured despite numerous

motion of a spring-tethered ball within different rotating flows. The
experiment corroborates the theory: efficient outward angular momentum
transport manifests only for cases with a weak spring in quasi-Keperian flow.
Our experimental method accomplishes this in a new way, thereby connecting

interpolation, but the compressed image data after interpolation has some
redundancy because the interpolated data are computed from the captured raw

multispectral data before interpolation. We also propose a new spectral
transform method for the compression of mosaicked multispectral images. This
transform is designed by considering the filter arrangement and the spectral
sensitivities of a multispectral filter array. The experimental results show
that the proposed method achieves a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio at higher
bit rates than a conventional compression method that encodes a multispectral
image after interpolation, e.g., 3-dB gain over conventional compression when
coding at rates of over 0.1 bit/pixel/bands.

analysis, enabling researchers to rapidly locate many particles to within a few
pixels in a microscope image. The vast majority of these algorithms operate
through heuristic approaches inspired by computer vision, such as identifying
particles with a blob detection. While rapid, these algorithms are plagued by
biases [4, 15, 24], and many researchers still frequently ignore or understate
these biases. In this paper, we examine sources of biases in particle
localization. Rather than exhaustively examine all possible sources of bias, we
illustrate their scale, the large number of sources, and the difficulty of
correcting the biases with a heuristic method. We do this by generating a
series of simple images, introducing sources of bias one at a time. Using these
images, we examine the performance of two heuristic algorithms throughout the
process: a centroid algorithm and a Gaussian fitting algorithm. We contrast the
two heuristic methods with a new approach based on reconstructing an image with
a generative model to fit the data (Parameter Extraction from Reconstructing
Images, or PERI). While the heuristic approaches produce considerable biases
even on unrealistically simple images, the reconstruction-based approach
accurately measures particle positions even in complex, highly realistic
images. We close by reiterating the fundamental reason that a
reconstruction-based approach accurately extracts particle positions -- any
imperfections in the fit both demonstrate which sources of systematic error are
still present and provide a roadmap to incorporating them.

provide tighter constraints on their sky-signal. We outline the physical
properties of zero metallicity Population III stars from MESA stellar evolution
models through helium-depletion and of BH accretion disks at z$\gtrsim$7. We
assume that second-generation non-zero metallicity stars can form at higher
multiplicity, so that BH accretion disks may be fed by Roche-lobe overflow from
lower-mass companions. We use these near-infrared SB constraints to calculate
the number of caustic transits behind lensing clusters that the James Webb
Space Telescope and the next generation ground-based telescopes may observe for
both Population III stars and their BH accretion disks. Typical caustic
magnifications can be $\mu$$\simeq$10$^4$-10$^5$, with rise times of hours and
decline times of $\lesssim$1 year for cluster transverse velocities of
$v_{T}$$\lesssim$1000 km s$^{-1}$. Microlensing by intracluster medium objects
can modify transit magnifications, but lengthen visibility times. Depending on
BH masses, accretion-disk radii and feeding efficiencies, stellar-mass BH
accretion-disk caustic transits could outnumber those from Population III
stars. To observe Population III caustic transits directly may require to
monitor 3-30 lensing clusters to AB$\lesssim$29 mag over a decade.

signal associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star inspiral. This evidence
derives from a laboratory experiment simultaneously measuring the $\beta$-decay
rates of Si-32 and Cl-36 in a common detector. Whereas the Si-32 and Cl-36
decay rates show no statistical correlation before or after the inspiral, they
are highly correlated ($\sim 95\%$) in the 5 hour time interval immediately
following the inspiral. If we interpret this correlation as arising from the
influence of particles emitted during the inspiral, then we can estimate the
mass $m_{x}$ of these particles from the time delay between the gravity-wave
signal and a peak in the $\beta$-decay data. We find for particles of energy 10
MeV, $m_{x}$ $\lesssim$ 16 eV which includes the neutrino mass region $m_{\nu}$
$\lesssim$ 2 eV. The latter is based on existing limits for the masses $m_{i}$
of the three known neutrino flavors. Additionally, we find that the correlation
is even stronger if we include data in the 80 minute period before the arrival
of the gravity wave signal. Given the large number of radionuclides whose
decays are being monitored at any given time, we conjecture that other groups
may also be in a position to search for statistically suggestive fluctuations
of radionuclide decay rates associated with the GW170817 inspiral, and possibly
with other future inspirals.

uncertainty in the conductivity coefficient, we treat the unknown conductivity
as a nuisance parameter and carry out approximative premarginalization over it,
and invert for the Robin coefficient field only. We approximate the related
modelling errors via the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach. The
uncertainty analysis presented here relies on a local linearization of the
parameter-to-observable map at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates, which
leads to a normal (Gaussian) approximation of the parameter posterior density.
To compute the MAP point we apply an inexact Newton conjugate gradient approach
based on the adjoint methodology. The construction of the covariance is made
tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the data misfit component of
the Hessian. Two numerical experiments are considered: one where the prior
covariance on the conductivity is isotropic, and one where the prior covariance
on the conductivity is anisotropic. Results are compared to those based on
standard error models, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of the
posterior uncertainty estimates. We show that the BAE approach is a feasible
one in the sense that the predicted posterior uncertainty is consistent with
the actual estimation errors, while neglecting the related modelling error
yields infeasible estimates for the Robin coefficient. In addition, we
demonstrate that the BAE approach is approximately as computationally expensive
(measured in the number of PDE solves) as the conventional error approach.

$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ distributions. We find that bimodal
$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ distributions arise in galaxies whose gas accretion
histories exhibit episodes of significant infall at both early and late times,
with the former fostering more intense star formation than the latter. The
shorter characteristic consumption timescale of gas accreted in the earlier
episode suppresses its enrichment with iron synthesised by Type Ia SNe,
resulting in the formation of a high-$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ sequence. We find
that bimodality in $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ similar to that seen in the Galaxy is
rare, appearing in approximately 5 percent of galaxies in our sample. We posit
that this is a consequence of an early gas accretion episode requiring the mass
accretion history of a galaxy's dark matter halo to exhibit a phase of
atypically-rapid growth at early epochs. The scarcity of EAGLE galaxies
exhibiting distinct sequences in the $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$

ongoing and/or recent HI stripping. 26% of A1367 LTGs have an Aflux ratio, more
asymmetrical than 3 times the 1{\sigma} spread in the Aflux ratio distribution

interactions could be making a significant contribution to the LTGs displaying
such Aflux ratios. The study also demonstrates that the definition of the HI
offset from the optical centre of LTGs is resolution dependent, suggesting that
unresolved AGES HI offsets that are significantly larger than the pointing
uncertainties (> 2 {\sigma}) reflect interactions which have asymmetrically
displaced significant masses of lower density HI, while having minimal impact
on the location of the highest density HI in resolved maps. The distribution of
Aflux from a comparable sample of Virgo galaxies provides a clear indication

in the area of social conversation as well as free-form conversation over a
broad range of domains and topics. To advance the state of the art in
conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million-dollar
university competition where sixteen selected university teams were challenged
to build conversational agents, known as socialbots, to converse coherently and
engagingly with humans on popular topics such as Sports, Politics,
Entertainment, Fashion and Technology for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize offers
the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research with a live
system used by millions of users. The competition provided university teams
with real user conversational data at scale, along with the user-provided
ratings and feedback augmented with annotations by the Alexa team. This enabled
teams to effectively iterate and make improvements throughout the competition
while being evaluated in real-time through live user interactions. To build
their socialbots, university teams combined state-of-the-art techniques with
novel strategies in the areas of Natural Language Understanding, Context
Modeling, Dialog Management, Response Generation, and Knowledge Acquisition. To
support the efforts of participating teams, the Alexa Prize team made
significant scientific and engineering investments to build and improve
Conversational Speech Recognition, Topic Tracking, Dialog Evaluation, Voice
User Experience, and tools for traffic management and scalability. This paper
outlines the advances created by the university teams as well as the Alexa
Prize team to achieve the common goal of solving the problem of Conversational
AI.

spin relaxation mechanisms in graphene and in heterostructures of
two-dimensional materials. We generalize the diffusive spin transport equations
of oblique spin precession in a lateral spin valve with finite contact
resistance. This yields a method to determine the spin lifetime anisotropy
ratio {\xi}={\tau}$_{\perp}$/{\tau}$_{\parallel}$, which is the ratio between
lifetimes of spin polarized perpendicular and parallel to the graphene surface.
By solving the steady-state Bloch equations, we show that the line-shape of the
oblique spin precession signal can be described with six dimensionless
parameters, which can be solved analytically. We demonstrate that the
anisotropic spin precession characteristics can be strongly suppressed by
contact induced spin relaxation originating from conductance mismatch between
the channel material and electrodes. To extract the spin lifetime anisotropy
ratio accurately, we develop a closed form equation that includes the effect of
finite contact resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the high contact
resistance regime, the minimum channel length required for accurately
determining the spin lifetime anisotropy for a sufficiently low external
magnetic field is only determined by the diffusion coefficient of the channel
material, as opposed to the spin diffusion length. Our work provides an
accurate model to extract the spin lifetime anisotropy ratio from the oblique
spin precession measurement, and can be used to guide the device design for
such measurements.

  original form 2017 August 17",,"10.1093/mnras/sty120",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new method for embedding a stellar disc in a cosmological dark
matter halo and provide a worked example from a {\Lambda}CDM zoom-in
simulation. The disc is inserted into the halo at a redshift z = 3 as a
zero-mass rigid body. Its mass and size are then increased adiabatically while
its position, velocity, and orientation are determined from rigid-body
dynamics. At z = 1, the rigid disc is replaced by an N-body disc whose
particles sample a three-integral distribution function (DF). The simulation
then proceeds to z = 0 with live disc and halo particles. By comparison, other
methods assume one or more of the following: the centre of the rigid disc
during the growth phase is pinned to the minimum of the halo potential, the
orientation of the rigid disc is fixed, or the live N-body disc is constructed
from a two rather than three-integral DF. In general, the presence of a disc
makes the halo rounder, more centrally concentrated, and smoother, especially
in the innermost regions. We find that methods in which the disc is pinned to
the minimum of the halo potential tend to overestimate the amount of adiabatic
contraction. Additionally, the effect of the disc on the subhalo distribution
appears to be rather insensitive to the disc insertion method. The live disc in
our simulation develops a bar that is consistent with the bars seen in
late-type spiral galaxies. In addition, particles from the disc are launched or
""kicked up"" to high galactic latitudes.

  Redundancy",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new vulnerability of cyber-physical systems to
malicious attack. It arises when the physical plant, that is modeled as a
continuous-time LTI system, is controlled by a digital controller. In the
sampled-data framework, most anomaly detectors monitor the plant's output only
at discrete time instants, and thus, nothing abnormal can be detected as long
as the sampled output behaves normal. This implies that if an actuator attack
drives the plant's state to pass through the kernel of the output matrix at
each sensing time, then the attack compromises the system while remaining
stealthy. We show that this type of attack always exists when the sampled-data
system has an input redundancy, i.e., the number of inputs being larger than
that of the outputs or the sampling rate of the actuators being higher than
that of the sensors. Simulation results for the X-38 vehicle and for the other
numerical examples illustrate this new attack strategy possibly brings
disastrous consequences.

However, human interpretation of brain signals is subjective and prone to
misdiagnosis. Automating this process, especially seizure detection relying on
scalp-based Electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, has been the
focus of research over recent decades. Nevertheless, its numerous challenges
have inhibited a definitive solution. Inspired by recent advances in deep
learning, we propose a new classification approach for EEG time series based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) via the use of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
networks. The proposed deep network effectively learns and models
discriminative temporal patterns from EEG sequential data. Especially, the
features are automatically discovered from the raw EEG data without any
pre-processing step, eliminating humans from laborious feature design task. We
also show that, in the epilepsy scenario, simple architectures can achieve
competitive performance. Using simple architectures significantly benefits in
the practical scenario considering their low computation complexity and reduced
requirement for large training datasets. Using a public dataset, a multi-fold
cross-validation scheme exhibited an average validation accuracy of 95.54\% and
an average AUC of 0.9582 of the ROC curve among all sets defined in the
experiment. This work reinforces the benefits of deep learning to be further

shortens the lifetimes of the sensor networks. Although flooding attack
prevention techniques have been proposed, if a continuous flooding attack

the sensor node, energy balancing of the sensor node is controlled by
determining the number of pathways using fuzzy logic. By adjusting the energy
balancing of the sensor nodes, the number of energy-exhausting sensor nodes can
be reduced. As a result, when a flooding attack occurs, the energy efficiency
of the sensor node is increased by determining the number of pathways.

generic proposals. Handcrafted proposals that rely on user knowledge about the
posterior distribution can be efficient, but are difficult to derive and

programming languages. One strategy for writing good proposal programs is to
combine domain-specific heuristic algorithms with neural network models. The
heuristics identify high probability regions, and the neural networks model the
posterior uncertainty around the outputs of the algorithm. Proposal programs
can be used as proposal distributions in importance sampling and
Metropolis-Hastings samplers without sacrificing asymptotic consistency, and
can be optimized offline using inference compilation. Support for optimizing
and using proposal programs is easily implemented in a sampling-based
probabilistic programming runtime. The paper illustrates the proposed technique
with a proposal program that combines RANSAC and neural networks to accelerate
inference in a Bayesian linear regression with outliers model.

be forbidden, at a critical magnetic field. The conductivity is determined
solely by the backscattering between the two states, leading to a resistance

importantly, this forbidden backscattering mechanism for the resistance dip is
irrelevant to details of disorder scattering. Our theory can be applied to

optimal locally repairable codes can be $q+1$ in \cite{JMX17}. Surprisingly,
\cite{BHHMV16} presented a few examples of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable
codes of small distance and locality with code length achieving roughly $q^2$.
Very recently, it was further shown in \cite{LMX17} that there exist $q$-ary
optimal locally repairable codes with length bigger than $q+1$ and distance
propositional to $n$.
  Thus, it becomes an interesting and challenging problem to construct new
families of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes of length bigger than
$q+1$.
  In this paper, we construct a class of optimal locally repairable codes of
distance $3$ and $4$ with unbounded length (i.e., length of the codes is
independent of the code alphabet size). Our technique is through cyclic codes
with particular generator and parity-check polynomials that are carefully
chosen.

Alexa Prize provided the academic community with the unique opportunity to

be used as a reasonable proxy for human judgment. We provide a mechanism to
unify the metrics for selecting the top performing agents, which has also been
applied throughout the Alexa Prize competition. To our knowledge, to date it is
the largest setting for evaluating agents with millions of conversations and
hundreds of thousands of ratings from users. We believe that this work is a

approximate their surface temperature distributions and compare the measured
thermal-infrared flux with model-dependent predictions. The most commonly used
thermal model is the Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM), which is

thermal-infrared observations of Near-Earth Objects using synthetic asteroids

the NEATM to provide more accurate diameters and albedos than the FRM in most

physical properties of the objects, but we find a large impact of the solar
phase angle on the modeling results. We conclude that the NEATM provides
statistically more robust diameter estimates for NEAs observed at solar phase
angles less than ~65{\deg}, while the FRM provides more robust diameter
estimates for solar phase angles greater than ~65{\deg}. We estimate that <5%

effects that are of the same order of magnitude as the typical thermal model
uncertainties. We provide statistical correction functions for diameters and

Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory as well as the EUV
Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode. The high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic
observations show that the current sheet is mainly visible in high temperature
(>10 MK) passbands, particularly in the Fe XXIV 192.03 line with a formation
temperature of ~18 MK. The hot Fe XXIV 192.03 line exhibits very large
nonthermal velocities up to 200 km/s in the current sheet, suggesting that
turbulent motions exist there. The largest turbulent velocity occurs at the
edge of the current sheet, with some offset with the strongest line intensity.
At the central part of the current sheet, the turbulent velocity is negatively
correlated with the line intensity. From the line emission and turbulent
features we obtain a thickness in the range of 7--11 Mm for the current sheet.
These results suggest that the current sheet has internal fine and dynamic
structures that may help the magnetic reconnection within it proceeds
efficiently.

spreading has received little study. We propose a model that couples epidemic
spreading and resource diffusion in multiplex networks. The spread of disease
in a physical contact layer and the recovery of the infected nodes are both
strongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social
layer. The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in
turn strongly dependent upon the state of the nodes in the physical contact
layer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly in this model. To quantify
the degree of preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls the
resource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that
the preferential resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the
fraction of infected nodes. When the degree of interlayer correlation is below
a critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes the phase transition
from double continuous to single continuous. When the degree of interlayer
correlation is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from
multiple continuous to first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find
hysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also find that there is an optimal
resource strategy at each fixed degree of interlayer correlation where the
threshold reaches a maximum and under which the disease can be maximally
suppressed. In addition, the optimal controlling parameter increases as the
degree of inter-layer correlation increases.

covariates, and captures how well one can identify compliers and obtain tight
bounds on identifiable subgroup effects. We develop an estimator of sharpness,
and show that it is asymptotically efficient under weak conditions. Finally we
explore finite-sample properties via simulation, and apply the methods to study

under which conditions a relay should be deployed and where to deploy it if
necessary in terms of the energy and delay performance in linear underwater
acoustic networks. To address these two problems, we first accurately
approximate the complicated effective bandwidth and transmit power in the
logarithm domain to formulate an energy minimization problem. By analyzing the
formulation, we discover a critical transmission distance, defined as open
distance, and explicitly show that a relay should not be deployed if the
transmission distance is less than the open distance and should be otherwise.
Most importantly, we derive a closed-form and easy-to-calculate expression for
the open distance and also strictly prove that the optimal placing position is
at the middle point of the link when a relay should be introduced. Moreover,
although this paper considers a linear two-hop relay network as the first step,
our derived results can be applied to construct energy-efficient and
delay-friendly multi-hop networks. Simulation results validate our theoretical
analysis and show that properly introducing a relay can dramatically reduce the
network energy consumption almost without increasing the end-to-end delay.

plays a significant role in their biophysical functions, but most previous
methods for characterizing their mechanical properties have neglected the
effects of surface stress. In this work, we investigate the micropipette
aspiration to measure the mechanical properties of cells and soft tissues with
surface effects. The neo-Hookean constitutive model is adopted to describe the
hyperelasticity of the measured biological material, and the surface effect is
considered through the finite element method. It is found that when the pipette
radius or aspiration length is comparable to the elastocapillary length,
surface energy may distinctly alter the aspiration response. Generally, both
the aspiration length and the bulk normal stress decreases as surface energy
increases, and thus neglecting the surface energy will lead to an
overestimation of elastic modulus. Through dimensional analysis and numerical
simulations, we provide an explicit relation between the imposed pressure and
the aspiration length. This method can be applied to accurately determine the
mechanical properties of soft biological tissues and organs, e.g., tumors and
embryos.

workloads in many applications. Their execution may be accelerated by using
multidimensional index structures (MDIS), such as kd-trees or R-trees. As for
most index structures, the usefulness of this approach depends on the
selectivity of the queries, and common wisdom told that a simple scan beats
MDIS for queries accessing more than 15%-20% of a dataset. However, this wisdom
is largely based on evaluations that are almost two decades old, performed on
data being held on disks, applying IO-optimized data structures, and using
single-core systems. The question is whether this rule of thumb still holds
when multidimensional range queries (MDRQ) are performed on modern
architectures with large main memories holding all data, multi-core CPUs and
data-parallel instruction sets. In this paper, we study the question whether
and how much modern hardware influences the performance ratio between index
structures and scans for MDRQ. To this end, we conservatively adapted three
popular MDIS, namely the R*-tree, the kd-tree, and the VA-file, to exploit
features of modern servers and compared their performance to different flavors
of parallel scans using multiple (synthetic and real-world) analytical
workloads over multiple (synthetic and real-world) datasets of varying size,
dimensionality, and skew. We find that all approaches benefit considerably from
using main memory and parallelization, yet to varying degrees. Our evaluation
indicates that, on current machines, scanning should be favored over parallel
versions of classical MDIS even for very selective queries.

products. A database benchmark must have a dataset D. To be
application-specific, this dataset D should be empirical. However, D may be too
small, or too large, for the benchmarking experiments. D must, therefore, be
scaled to the desired size.
  To ensure the scaled D' is similar to D, previous work typically specifies or
extracts a fixed set of features F = {F_1, F_2, . . . , F_n} from D, then uses
F to generate synthetic data for D'. However, this approach (D -> F -> D')
becomes increasingly intractable as F gets larger, so a new solution is
necessary.
  Different from existing approaches, this paper proposes ASPECT to scale D to
enforce similarity. ASPECT first uses a size-scaler (S0) to scale D to D'. Then
the user selects a set of desired features F'_1, . . . , F'_n. For each desired
feature F'_k, there is a tweaking tool T_k that tweaks D' to make sure D' has
the required feature F'_k. ASPECT coordinates the tweaking of T_1,...,T_n to
D', so T_n(...(T_1(D'))...) has the required features F'_1,...,F'_n.
  By shifting from D -> F -> D' to D -> D' -> F', data scaling becomes
flexible. The user can customise the scaled dataset with their own interested
features. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that ASPECT can enforce
similarity in the dataset effectively and efficiently.

source of coherent surface plasmons (SPASER). The possibility of spasing in
single SiQD is investigated theoretically utilizing full quantum mechanical
treatment. We show that spasing can take place in doped SiQDs whenever Quality
factor of a plasmon mode exceeds some minimum value. The minimum value depends
on size and doping concentration of SiQDs. It can be used to design an optimum
structure as SPASER in silicon technologies. The condition on Quality factor is
translated to a condition for radius and it is shown that for a given Localized
Surface Plasmon (LSP) mode, the radius should be less than some critical value.
This value only depends on mode index. The required relations for design
purposes are derived and, as an example of feasibility of the approach, a
SPASER is designed for mid infrared. Moreover, we propose a more applicable
device by arranging an array of doped SiQDs on top of a graphene layer.
Coupling the Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) modes of graphene with LSP modes
of SiQDs causes outcoupling of an intense ultra narrow beam of coherent SPPs to
be used in real probable applications.

relaxation rate~$\lambda$ exhibits power-law divergences in temperature and
magnetic field, the latter for fields that are too weak to affect the

$\lambda(\omega_\mu,T)$ to the dynamic structure factor~$S(\omega_\mu,T)$,
where $\omega_\mu \approx 10^5$--$10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is the muon Zeeman

approach where the constraints are fulfilled for a set of realizations and
provide probabilistic generalization guarantees as a function of the number of
considered realizations. We use separate chance constraints for the
satisfaction of the specification and operational constraints. This allows us
to quantify their violation probabilities independently. We compute disturbance
feedback policies as solutions of mixed-integer linear or quadratic

realizations and provide feasibility for a wider range of situations compared
to static input sequences. We demonstrate the proposed method on two robust

enhancing mobiles' computation capabilities and prolonging their battery lives,
by offloading intensive computation from mobiles to nearby servers such as base
stations. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient resource-management
policy for the asynchronous MECO system, where the mobiles have heterogeneous
input-data arrival time instants and computation deadlines. First, we consider
the general case with arbitrary arrival-deadline orders. Based on the monomial
energy-consumption model for data transmission, an optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the total mobile-energy consumption under the
time-sharing and computation-deadline constraints. The optimal
resource-management policy for data partitioning (for offloading and local
computing) and time division (for transmissions) is shown to be computed by
using the block coordinate decent method. To gain further insights, we study
the optimal resource-management design for two special cases. First, consider
the case of identical arrival-deadline orders, i.e., a mobile with input data
arriving earlier also needs to complete computation earlier. The optimization
problem is reduced to two sequential problems corresponding to the optimal
scheduling order and joint data-partitioning and time-division given the
optimal order. It is found that the optimal time-division policy tends to
balance the defined effective computing power among offloading mobiles via time
sharing. Furthermore, this solution approach is extended to the case of reverse
arrival-deadline orders. The corresponding time-division policy is derived by a
proposed transformation-and-scheduling approach, which first determines the
total offloading duration and data size for each mobile in the transformation
phase and then specifies the offloading intervals for each mobile in the
scheduling phase.

degree of strengthening. In the limit when one partner of the pair is placed
very close to the Neumann boundary, the interaction potential is larger when
the pair is parallel with the boundary than when it is perpendicular to, which
is just opposite to the case when the boundary is Dirichlet where the latter is
larger than the former. In addition, we find that the pair-boundary separation

partitioning algorithms in our approach to the problem. It finds such a safe
construction, when one exists, provided the algebraic connectivity of the graph
components is stronger than all the spatially local instabilities in the
respective components. The dynamics of the populations on the spatially
discrete patches (graph nodes) and their spatial communication with other
patches is modeled as a reaction-diffusion system. By reversing the
Turing-instability idea the stability conditions of the partitioned system are
found to depend on local dynamics of the metapopulations and the Fiedler value
of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. This leads to the necessary and
sufficient conditions for removal of the graph edges subject to the stability
of the partitioned graph networks. An heuristic bisection graph partitioning
algorithm has been proposed and examples illustrate the theoretical result.

system and two continuous-mode photons. Two scenarios are investigated: Case 1,
how a two-level system changes the pulse shapes of two input photons
propagating in a single input channel; and Case 2, how a two-level system
responds to two counter-propagating photons. By means of a transfer function
approach, the steady-state output field states for both cases are derived
analytically. In Example 1, a two-photon input state of Gaussian pulse shape is
used to excite a two-level atom. The simulation demonstrates that in the time
domain the atom tends to stretch out the two photons. Moreover, the striking
difference between the joint probability distribution of the output two-photon
state and that of the input two-photon state occurs exactly under the setting
when the two-level atom is most efficiently excited. In Example 2, a two-photon
input state of rising exponential pulse shape is used to excite a two-level
atom. Strong anti-correlation of the output two-photon state is observed, which
is absent in Example 1 for the Gaussian pulse shape. Such difference indicates
that different pulse shapes give rise to drastically different frequency
entanglement of the output two-photon state. Example 3 is used to illustrate
Case 2, where two counter-propagating single photons of rising exponential
pulse shapes are input to a two-level atom. The frequency-dependent
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference phenomenon is observed. The simulation
results base on the analytic forms of output two-photon states are consistent
with those based on quantum master or filter equations [43,11]. Similar
physical phenomena have been observed in physical settings such as cavity

rearrangements of their amino acids, which exhibit large-scale dynamical modes.
Long-range correlations have also been revealed in protein sequences, and this
has motivated the search for physical links between the observed genetic and
dynamic cooperativity. We outline here a simplified theory of protein, which
relates sequence correlations to physical interactions and to the emergence of
mechanical function. Our protein is modeled as a strongly-coupled amino acid
network whose interactions and motions are captured by the mechanical
propagator, the Green function. The propagator describes how the gene
determines the connectivity of the amino acids, and thereby the transmission of
forces. Mutations introduce localized perturbations to the propagator which
scatter the force field. The emergence of function is manifested by a
topological transition when a band of such perturbations divides the protein
into subdomains. We find that epistasis -- the interaction among mutations in

counting process, also called a binomial counting process under regime
switching. Such a process naturally appears in the context of credit risk when
multiple obligors are present. Markov-modulation takes place when the
failure/default rate of each individual obligor depends on an underlying Markov
chain. The limit behavior under consideration occurs when the number of

process, called rapid switching. We establish diffusion approximations,
obtained by application of (semi)martingale central limit theorems. Depending

problems based on the variational level-set method of (Zhao et al., J Comput
Phys 127, 1996) which has been widely used in many partitioning problems such
as image segmentation and shape optimization. Here, the variational model and
its level-set formulation have been simplified that only one single level-set
function is evolved. Thus, the numerical implementation becomes simple, and the
computational and memory overhead are significantly alleviated, making this
method suitable for solving realistic block-structured mesh partitioning
problems where a large number of regions is required. We start to verify this
method by a range of two-dimensional and three-dimensional uniform mesh
partitioning cases. The results agree with the theoretical solutions very well
and converge rapidly. More complex cases, including block-structured adaptive
mesh partitioning for single-phase and multi-phase multi-resolution
simulations, confirm the accuracy, robustness and good convergence property.
The measured CPU time shows that this method is efficient for both
two-dimensional and three-dimensional realistic partitioning problems in
parallel computing. The proposed method has the potential to be extended to
solve other partitioning problems by replacing the energy functional.

using high-spatial resolution imaging as well as imaging spectroscopy and
near-infrared (NIR) spectropolarimetry. Horizontal proper motions were
estimated with LCT, whereas LOS velocities were computed with spectral line
fitting methods. The magnetic field properties were inferred with the SIR code
for the Si I and Ca I NIR lines. At the time of the GREGOR observations, the
leading sunspot had two light-bridges indicating the onset of its decay. One of
the light-bridges disappeared, and an elongated, dark umbral core at its edge
appeared in a decaying penumbral sector facing the newly emerging flux. The
flow and magnetic field properties of this penumbral sector exhibited weak
Evershed flow, moat flow, and horizontal magnetic field. The penumbral gap
adjacent to the elongated umbral core and the penumbra in that penumbral sector
displayed LOS velocities similar to granulation. The separating polarities of a
new flux system interacted with the leading and central part of the already
established active region. As a consequence, the leading spot rotated 55-degree
in clockwise direction over 12 hours. In the high-resolution observations of a
decaying sunspot, the penumbral filaments facing flux emergence site contained
a darkened area resembling an umbral core filled with umbral dots. This umbral
core had velocity and magnetic field properties similar to the sunspot umbra.
This implies that the horizontal magnetic fields in the decaying penumbra
became vertical as observed in flare-induced rapid penumbral decay, but on a
very different time-scale.

integration of a network of controllers within the structure of the

convection are key to many geophysical problems. An essential question related
to these phenomena concerns the estimation of the (time-evolving) melting rate,
which is tightly connected to the turbulent convective dynamics in the bulk of
the melt fluid and the heat transfer at the liquid-solid interface. In this
work, we consider a convective-melting model, constructed as a generalization
of the Rayleigh-B\'enard system, accounting for the basal melting of a solid.
As the change of phase proceeds, a fluid layer grows at the heated bottom of
the system and eventually reaches a turbulent convection state. By means of
extensive Lattice-Boltzmann numerical simulations employing an enthalpy
formulation of the governing equations, we explore the model dynamics in two
and three-dimensional configurations. The focus of the analysis is on the
scaling of global quantities like the heat flux and the kinetic energy with the
Rayleigh number, as well as on the interface morphology and the effects of
space dimensionality. Independently of dimensionality, we find that the
convective-melting system behavior shares strong resemblances with that of the
Rayleigh-B\'enard one, and that the heat flux is only weakly enhanced with
respect to that case. Such similarities are understood, at least to some
extent, considering the resulting slow motion of the melting front (with
respect to the turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations) and its generally little
roughness (compared to the height of the fluid layer). Varying the Stefan
number, accounting for the thermodynamical properties of the material, also
seems to have only a mild effect, which implies the possibility to extrapolate
results in numerically delicate low-Stefan setups from more convenient

so-called Stackelberg strategic game: A Subset Sum setting is addressed with a
set $N$ of items with given integer weights. One distinguished player, the
leader, may alter the weights of the items in a given subset $L\subset N$, and
a second player, the follower, selects a solution $A\subseteq N$ in order to
utilize a bounded resource in the best possible way. Finally, the leader
receives a payoff from those items of its subset $L$ that were included in the
overall solution $A$, chosen by the follower. We assume that the follower
applies a publicly known, simple, heuristic algorithm to determine its solution
set, which avoids having to solve NP-hard problems.
  Two variants of the problem are considered, depending on whether the leader
is able to control (i.e., change) the weights of its items (i) in the objective
function or (ii) in the bounded resource constraint. The leader's objective is
the maximization of the overall weight reduction, for the first variant, or the
maximization of the weight increase for the latter one. In both variants there
is a trade-off for each item between the contribution value to the leader's
objective and the chance of being included in the follower's solution set.
  We analyze the leader's pricing problem for a natural greedy strategy of the
follower and discuss the complexity of the corresponding problems. We show that
setting the optimal weight values for the leader is, in general, NP-hard. It is
even NP-hard to provide a solution within a constant factor of the best
possible solution. Exact algorithms, based on dynamic programming and running
in pseudopolynomial time, are provided. The additional cases, in which the
follower faces a continuous (linear relaxation) version of the above problems,
are shown to be straightforward to solve.

  Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the problem of multi-band (frequency-variant)
covariance interpolation with a particular emphasis towards massive MIMO
applications. In a massive MIMO system, the communication between each BS with
$M \gg 1$ antennas and each single-antenna user occurs through a collection of
scatterers in the environment, where the channel vector of each user at BS
antennas consists in a weighted linear combination of the array responses of
the scatterers, where each scatterer has its own angle of arrival (AoA) and
complex channel gain. The array response at a given AoA depends on the
wavelength of the incoming planar wave and is naturally frequency dependent.
This results in a frequency-dependent distortion where the second order
statistics, i.e., the covariance matrix, of the channel vectors varies with
frequency. In this paper, we show that although this effect is generally
negligible for a small number of antennas $M$, it results in a considerable
distortion of the covariance matrix and especially its dominant signal subspace
in the massive MIMO regime where $M \to \infty$, and can generally incur a
serious degradation of the performance especially in frequency division
duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems where the uplink (UL) and the downlink
(DL) communication occur over different frequency bands. We propose a novel
UL-DL covariance interpolation technique that is able to recover the covariance
matrix in the DL from an estimate of the covariance matrix in the UL under a
mild reciprocity condition on the angular power spread function (PSF) of the
users. We analyze the performance of our proposed scheme mathematically and
prove its robustness under a sufficiently large spatial oversampling of the
array. We also propose several simple off-the-shelf algorithms for UL-DL
covariance interpolation and evaluate their performance via numerical
simulations.

presents the approach to calculate the first-passage time distribution in

employ multiple antennas at the base station or user equipment. To this end,
networks that employ current radios usually deal with self-interference and
multi-user interference by beamforming techniques. Although previous works
investigated beamforming design to improve spectral efficiency, the fundamental
question of how to split the antennas at a base station between uplink and
downlink in full-duplex networks has not been investigated rigorously. This
paper addresses this question by posing antenna splitting as a binary nonlinear
optimization problem to minimize the sum mean squared error of the received
data symbols. It is shown that this is an NP-hard problem. This combinatorial
problem is dealt with by equivalent formulations, iterative convex
approximations, and a binary relaxation. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed
to converge to a stationary solution of the relaxed problem with much smaller
complexity than exhaustive search. Numerical results indicate that the proposed
solution is close to the optimal in both high and low self-interference capable
scenarios, while the usually assumed antenna splitting is far from optimal. For
large number of antennas, a simple antenna splitting is close to the proposed
solution. This reveals that the importance of antenna splitting is inversely
proportional with the number of antennas.

$$\sup_{\pi}J(\pi)= J(\pi^{*}), \text {where } J(\pi)=
\mathbb{E}[\log(X^{\pi}(T))].$$ The insider market is called \emph{viable} if
this value is finite. We study under what inside information flow $\mathbb{H}$
the insider market is viable or not. For example, assume that for all $t<T$ the
insider knows the value of $B(t+\epsilon_t)$, where $t + \epsilon_t \geq T$
converges monotonically to $T$ from above as $t$ goes to $T$ from below. Then
(assuming that the insider has a perfect memory) at time $t$ she has the inside
information $\mathcal{H}_t$, consisting of the history $\mathcal{F}_t$ of
$B(s); 0 \leq s \leq t$ plus all the values of Brownian motion in the interval
$[t+\epsilon_t, \epsilon_0]$, i.e. we have the enlarged filtration
\begin{equation}\label{eq0.2} \mathbb{H}=\{\mathcal{H}_t\}_{t\in[0.T]},\quad
\mathcal{H}_t=\mathcal{F}_t\vee\sigma(B(t+\epsilon_t+r),0\leq r \leq
\epsilon_0-t-\epsilon_t), \forall t\in [0,T]. \end{equation} Using forward
integrals, Hida-Malliavin calculus and Donsker delta functionals we show that
if $$\int_0^T\frac{1}{\varepsilon_t}dt=\infty,$$ then the insider market is not
viable.

while a run state (straight motion) entails all the flagellar motors spinning
in counterclockwise mode, a tumble is caused by a shift in the state of one or
more motors to clockwise spinning mode. In the presence of an attractant
gradient in the environment, runs in the favourable direction are extended, and
this results in a net drift of the organism in the direction of the gradient.
The underlying signal transduction mechanism produces directed motion through a
bi-lobed response function which relates the clockwise bias of the flagellar
motor to temporal changes in the attractant concentration. The two lobes
(positive and negative) of the response function are separated by a time
interval of $\sim 1$s, such that the bacterium effectively compares the
concentration at two different positions in space and responds accordingly. We
present here a novel path-integral method which allows us to address this
problem in the most general way possible, including multi-step CW-CCW
transitions, directional persistence and power-law waiting time distributions.
The method allows us to calculate quantities such as the effective diffusion
coefficient and drift velocity, in a power series expansion in the attractant
gradient. Explicit results in the lowest order in the expansion are presented
for specific models, which, wherever applicable, agree with the known results.
New results for gamma-distributed run interval distributions are also
presented.

display a clear ring-like extended structure for the carrier of the broad 9-13

the dust continuum emission at 20.5 {\mu}m. This residual C60 emission, if
real, might have several interpretations; the most exciting being perhaps that
other fullerene-based species like hydrogenated fullerenes with very low
H-content may contribute to the observed 17.4 {\mu}m emission. We conclude that
higher sensitivity mid-IR images and spatially resolved spectroscopic

Later, we consider a more general multi-user multi-relay scenario. Under high
SNR approximation for end to end secrecy rate, an optimization problem is
formulated to jointly optimize power allocation at the BS, the relay selection,
sub-carrier assignment to users and the power loading at each of the relaying
node. The target is to maximize the overall security of the system subject to
independent power budget limits at each transmitting node and the OFDMA based
exclusive sub-carrier allocation constraints. A joint optimization solution is
obtained through duality theory. Dual decomposition allows to exploit convex
optimization techniques to find the power loading at the source and relay
nodes. Further, an optimization for power loading at relaying nodes along with
relay selection and sub carrier assignment for the fixed power allocation at

unveil the coupled electron-lattice dynamics of a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal
upon intense photoexcitation through a unique combination of ultrafast electron
diffraction, time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, and time-dependent ab

phonon avalanche mechanism responsible for breaking the bottleneck. The
avalanche involves a collective emission of low-energy phonons - mainly
associated with the organic sub-lattice - that proceeds in a regenerative
manner and correlates with the accumulation and confinement of photocarriers at

topological materials, and this new viewpoint of topology has opened a new
horizon in material science. In this paper we find that electrides are suitable
for achieving various topological phases, including topological insulating and
topological semimetal phases. In the electrides, in which electrons serve as
anions, the bands occupied by the anionic electrons lie near the Fermi level,
because the anionic electrons are weakly bound by the lattice. This property of
the electrides is favorable for achieving band inversions needed for
topological phases, and thus the electrides are prone to topological phases.
From such a point of view, we find many topological electrides, Y$_2$C
(nodal-line semimetal (NLS)), Sc$_2$C (insulator with $\pi$ Zak phase),
Sr$_2$Bi (NLS), HfBr (quantum spin Hall system), and LaBr (quantum anomalous

the electrides and the topological materials is useful in material science in
both fields.

or enterprise environments with bring-your-own-device policy, require central
coordination by a leader node. In the past it has been proven that distributed
leader election in dynamic environments with constant changes and asynchronous
communication is not possible. Thus, state-of-the-art leader election
algorithms are not applicable in asynchronous environments with constant
network changes. Some algorithms converge only after the network stabilizes (an
unrealistic requirement in many dynamic environments). Other algorithms reach
consensus in the presence of network changes but require a global clock or some
level of communication synchronization.
  Determining the weakest assumptions, under which leader election is possible,
remains an unresolved problem. In this study we present a leader election
algorithm that operates in the presence of changes and under weak (realistic)

accurate sound source localization using a single microphone embedded in an
arbitrary scattering structure. The structure modifies the frequency response

inverse problem which we regularize by prior knowledge in the form of learned

algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization that does not depend on
sophisticated, designed scatterers. In fact, we show experimental results with

due to the introduction of delay and inconsistency in inherently sequential

unrealistic assumptions. Through a novel perspective, we revisit and clarify a
subtle but important technical issue present in a large fraction of the recent
convergence rate proofs for asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms, and
propose a simplification of the recently introduced ""perturbed iterate""

by analyzing three distinct asynchronous parallel incremental optimization
algorithms: Hogwild (asynchronous SGD), KROMAGNON (asynchronous SVRG) and
ASAGA, a novel asynchronous parallel version of the incremental gradient
algorithm SAGA that enjoys fast linear convergence rates. We are able to both
remove problematic assumptions and obtain better theoretical results. Notably,
we prove that ASAGA and KROMAGNON can obtain a theoretical linear speedup on
multi-core systems even without sparsity assumptions. We present results of an
implementation on a 40-core architecture illustrating the practical speedups as
well as the hardware overhead. Finally, we investigate the overlap constant, an
ill-understood but central quantity for the theoretical analysis of

task in many disciplines. Calibration is traditionally accomplished by imaging
the spectrum of a light source containing features that are known to appear at
certain wavelengths and mapping them to their location on the sensor. This is
typically required in conjunction with each scientific observation to account
for mechanical and optical variations of the instrument over time, which may
span years for certain projects. The method presented here investigates the
usage of color itself instead of spectral features to calibrate a spectrograph.
The primary advantage of such a calibration is that any broad-spectrum light
source such as the sky or an incandescent bulb is suitable. This method allows
for calibration using the full optical pathway of the instrument instead of
incorporating separate calibration equipment that may introduce errors. This
paper focuses on the potential for color calibration in the field of radial
velocity astronomy, in which instruments must be finely calibrated for long
periods of time to detect tiny Doppler wavelength shifts. This method is not
restricted to radial velocity, however, and may find application in any field
requiring calibrated spectrometers such as sea water analysis, cellular
biology, chemistry, atmospheric studies, and so on. This paper demonstrates
that color sensors have the potential to provide calibration with greatly
reduced complexity.

  In this paper, we study $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}$. Vaguely speaking, this theory
categorifies the theory of D-modules, in the same way as Gaitsgory's original
$ShvCat$ categorifies the theory of quasi-coherent sheaves. We develop the
functoriality of $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}$, its descent properties and, most
importantly, the notion of $\mathbb H$-affineness. We then prove the $\mathbb

conditions, the $\infty$-category $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}(Y)$ is equivalent to the
$\infty$-category of modules for $\mathbb H(Y)$, the monoidal DG category

semiconductor spin qubits. Our methods are designed to target the tuning
procedures of semiconductor double quantum dot in GaAs heterostructures, but
can easily be adapted to other quantum-dot-like qubit systems. These tuning
procedures include the characterization of the inter-dot tunnel coupling, the
tunnel coupling to the surrounding leads and the identification of the various
fast initialization points for the operation of the qubit. Since
semiconductor-based spin qubits are compatible with standard semiconductor
process technology and hence promise good prospects of scalability, the
challenge of efficiently tuning the dot's parameters will only grow in the near
future, once the multi-qubit stage is reached. With the anticipation of being
used as the basis for future automated tuning protocols, all measurements
presented here are fast-to-execute and easy-to-analyze characterization
methods. They result in quantitative measures of the relevant qubit parameters
within a couple of seconds, and require almost no human interference.

remains unclear. Some basin-forming impacts occurred 3.9-3.7Gy ago. Many other
basins formed before, but their exact ages are not precisely known. There are
two possible interpretations of the data: in the cataclysm scenario there was a
surge in the impact rate approximately 3.9Gy ago, while in the accretion tail
scenario the lunar bombardment declined since the era of planet formation and
the latest basins formed in its tail-end. Here, we revisit the work of
Morbidelli et al.(2012) that examined which scenario could be compatible with
both the lunar crater record in the 3-4Gy period and the abundance of highly
siderophile elements (HSE) in the lunar mantle. We use updated numerical
simulations of the fluxes of impactors. Under the traditional assumption that
the HSEs track the total amount of material accreted by the Moon since its
formation, we conclude that only the cataclysm scenario can explain the data.
The cataclysm should have started ~3.95Gy ago. However we show that HSEs could
have been sequestered from the lunar mantle due to iron sulfide exsolution
during magma ocean crystallization, followed by mantle overturn. Based on the
hypothesis that the lunar magma ocean crystallized about 100-150My after Moon
formation, and therefore that HSEs accumulated in the lunar mantle only after
this time, we show that the bombardment in the 3-4Gy period can be explained in
the accretion tail scenario. This hypothesis would also explain why the Moon
appears so depleted in HSEs relative to the Earth. We also extend our analysis
of the cataclysm and accretion tail scenarios to the case of Mars. The
accretion tail scenario requires a global resurfacing event on Mars ~4.4Gy ago,
possibly associated with the formation of the Borealis basin, and it is
consistent with the HSE budget of the planet.

dominated by radiation or non-relativistic matter in several eras of its

precise treatment, quantum field theory in curved spacetime is needed. This
paper aims to fill this gap by presenting decay rates for matter and radiation
dominated universes in this more precise treatment. We provide a study of the
average decay rates for a process where a conformally coupled massive scalar
field decays into massless scalar particles. It is found that the presence of a
curved spacetime modifies the Minkowskian result considerably for early times
but asymptotically only by an additive term proportional to the inverse of mass
and interaction time. Thus, the correction is small for large time scales, but
on the time scales of the order of $m\sim t$, the relative correction term may
be of importance.

absorption lines, from the He and H-like transitions of N, O and Ne, as well as
from L-shell Fe. The strongest absorption lines are all systematically
blue-shifted by $-0.06c$, originating in two absorption zones, from low and
high ionization gas. Both zones are variable on timescales of days, with the
variations in absorber opacity effectively explained by either column density
changes or by the absorber ionization responding directly to the continuum
flux. We find that the soft X-ray absorbers probably exist in a two-phase wind,
at a radial distance of $10^{17}-10^{18}$ cm from the black hole, with the
lower ionization gas as denser clumps embedded within a higher ionization
outflow. The overall mass outflow rate of the soft X-ray wind may be as high as
$2{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, close to the Eddington rate for PG 1211+143 and

power delivered to the load is less than the power drawn from the battery. The
users consume a constant power for the circuit operation during transmission
but do not consume any power when not transmitting. In this setting, we obtain
the maximum sum-rates and achievable rate regions under various cases. We show
that, unlike in the ideal battery case, the TDMA (time-division multiple

always achieve the maximum sum-rate when the internal resistance is non-zero.
The users may need to adopt a hybrid NOMA-TDMA strategy which combines the
features of NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) and TDMA, wherein a set of

implies that stable configurations appear at lower energies with swap dynamics,
and thus at lower temperatures when the liquid is cooled. \maa{ The magnitude
of this effect is proportional to the width of the radii distribution, and
decreases with compression for finite-range purely repulsive interaction
potentials.} We test these predictions numerically and discuss the implications
of these findings for the glass transition.We extend these results to the case
of hard spheres where swap is argued to destroy meta-stable states of the free
energy coarse-grained on vibrational time scales. Our analysis unravels the
soft elastic modes responsible for the speed up swap induces, and allows us to
predict the structure and the vibrational properties of glass configurations
reachable with swap. In particular for continuously poly-disperse systems we
predict the jamming transition to be dramatically altered, as we confirm

and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) mounted on the top. The time distribution of
the photons collected by the PMT in the water Cherenkov detector have an
approximately exponential distribution, and their decay factor is determined by
the photon absorption length in the water, the reflectivity of the inner Tyvek
surface, the mean reflecting step length of photons reflected by the inner
surface, and the ratio of reflectional Tyvek area to the total inner surface
area. By considering the principles of photon propagation in the water
Cherenkov detector, we have developed novel methods to measure the water

The step length of photons can be determined by measuring the time distribution
of the reflected photons hitting the PMT after multiple photons with single
wavelength are generated in the tank, with slightly different ratios of the
inner Tyvek to the total inner area. The water absorption length and Tyvek
reflectivity can be measured simultaneously by the PMT by changing the height

measured simultaneously. The proposed novel methods are supported by deduction
of formulae and verified by GEANT4 simulations and the prototype experiment.

capillary interactions [2], to their dispersibility [3] and use as emulsion
stabilizers [4]. It also impacts particle-particle frictional contacts, which
have recently emerged as being responsible for the discontinuous shear
thickening (DST) of dense suspensions [5-17]. Tribological properties of these
contacts have been rarely experimentally accessed [6, 15, 17, 18], especially
for non-spherical particles. Here, we systematically tackle the effect of
nanoscale surface roughness by producing a library of all-silica,
raspberry-like colloids [19] and linking their rheology to their tribology.
Rougher surfaces lead to a significant anticipation of DST onset, both in terms
of shear rate and solid loading. Strikingly, they also eliminate continuous
thickening. DST is here due to the interlocking of asperities, which we have
identified as ""stick-slip"" frictional contacts by measuring the sliding of the
same particles via lateral force microscopy (LFM). Direct measurements of
particle-particle friction therefore highlight the value of an
engineering-tribology approach to tuning the thickening of suspensions.

The disk in HH 212 has a radius of ~ 60 au. The emission is mainly detected
from the nearside of the disk. The polarization orientations are almost
perpendicular to the disk major axis, consistent with either self-scattering or
emission by grains aligned with a poloidal field around the outer edge of the
disk because of optical depth effect and temperature gradient; the presence of
a poloidal field would facilitate the launching of a disk wind, for which there
is already tentative evidence in the same source. The disk of HH 111 VLA 1 has
a larger radius of ~ 220 au and is thus more resolved. The polarization
orientations are almost perpendicular to the disk major axis in the nearside,
but more along the major axis in the farside, forming roughly half of an

may explain the polarization on the near and far side of the disk,

of frictionless particles follow a Newtonian Trouton's ratio for $\phi$ all the
way up to $\phi_0$, a universal jamming point that is independent of
deformation type. In contrast, frictional particles lead to a
deformation-type-dependent jamming fraction $\phi_m$, which is largest for
shear flows. Trouton's ratio consequently starts off Newtonian but diverges as
$\phi\to\phi_m$. We explain this discrepancy in suspensions of frictional
particles by considering the particle arrangements at jamming. While
frictionless particle suspensions have a nearly isotropic microstructure at
jamming, friction permits more anisotropic contact chains that allow jamming at
lower $\phi$ but introduce protocol dependence. Finally, we provide evidence
that viscous number rheology can be extended from shear to extensional
deformations, with a particularly successful collapse for frictionless
particles. Extensional deformations are an important class of rheometric flow
in suspensions, relevant to paste processing, granulation and high performance
materials.

transitions are still not fully understood. This includes in particular the
role of the acid dopant and the defect dynamics that it creates within the
ices. Here we investigate the effects of several acid and base dopants on the
hydrogen ordering of ices V and VI with calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. HCl
is found to be most effective for both phases which is attributed to a
favourable combination of high solubility and strong acid properties which
create mobile H3O+ defects that enable the hydrogen-ordering processes.
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is the second most effective dopant highlighting that
the acid strengths of HCl and HF are much more similar in ice than they are in
liquid water. Surprisingly, hydrobromic acid doping facilitates hydrogen
ordering in ice VI whereas only a very small effect is observed for ice V.
Conversely, lithium hydroxide (LiOH) doping achieves a performance comparable
to HF-doping in ice V but it is ineffective in the case of ice VI. Sodium
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide (as previously shown) and perchloric acid doping
are ineffective for both phases. These findings highlight the need for future
computational studies but also raise the question why LiOH-doping achieves
hydrogen-ordering of ice V whereas potassium hydroxide doping is most effective

discharged. This motivates the cycle constraint which says that a battery must
be charged (discharged) only after it is sufficiently discharged (charged). We
also assume Bernoulli energy arrivals, and a half-duplex constraint due to
which the batteries are not charged and discharged simultaneously. In this
context, we study EH communication systems with: (a) a single-battery with
capacity 2B units and (b) dual-batteries, each having capacity of B units. The
aim is to obtain the best possible long-term average throughputs and throughput
regions in point-to-point (P2P) channels and multiple access channels (MAC),
respectively. For the P2P channel, we obtain an analytical optimal solution in
the single-battery case, and propose optimal and sub-optimal power allocation
policies for the dual-battery case. We extend these policies to obtain
achievable throughput regions in MACs by jointly allocating rates and powers.
From numerical simulations, we find that the optimal throughput in the

although the total storage capacity in both cases is 2B units. Further, in the
proposed policies, the largest throughput region in the single-battery case is

when no such strategy succeeds with probability larger than 1/2. This proves
the ""games quantum PCP conjecture"" of Fitzsimons and the second author
(ITCS'15), albeit under randomized reductions. The core component in our
reduction is a construction of a family of two-player games for testing
$n$-qubit maximally entangled states. For any integer $n\geq2$, we give a test
in which questions from the verifier are $O(\log n)$ bits long, and answers are
$\mathrm{poly}(\log\log n)$ bits long. We show that for any constant
$\varepsilon\geq0$, any strategy that succeeds with probability at least
$1-\varepsilon$ in the test must use a state that is within distance
$O(\varepsilon^c)$ from a state that is locally equivalent to a maximally
entangled state on $n$ qubits, for some universal constant $c>0$. The
construction is based on the classical plane-vs-point test for multivariate
low-degree polynomials of Raz and Safra (STOC'97). We extend the classical test
to the quantum regime by executing independent copies of the test in the
generalized Pauli $X$ and $Z$ bases over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q$ is a
sufficiently large prime power, and combine the two through a test for the
Pauli twisted commutation relations. Our main complexity-theoretic result is
obtained by combining this family of games with constructions of PCPs of
proximity introduced by Ben-Sasson et al. (CCC'05), and crucially relies on a
linear property of such PCPs. Another consequence of our results is a
deterministic reduction from the games quantum PCP conjecture to a suitable
formulation of the Hamiltonian quantum PCP conjecture.

points connected to the boundary by a path on which the values of the GFF
remain in $[-a,b]$. For specific choices of the parameters $a, b$ the
two-valued sets have the law of the CLE$_4$ carpet, the law of the union of
level lines between all pairs of boundary points, or, conjecturally, the law of
the interfaces of the scaling limit of XOR-Ising model.
  Two-valued sets are the closure of the union of countably many SLE$_4$ type
of loops, where each loop comes with a label equal to either $-a$ or $b$. One
of the main results of this paper describes the connectivity properties of
these loops. Roughly, we show that all the loops are disjoint if $a+b \geq
4\lambda$, and that their intersection graph is connected if $a + b <
4\lambda$. This also allows us to study the labels (the heights) of the loops.
We prove that the labels of the loops are a function of the set
$\mathbb{A}_{-a,b}$ if and only if $a\neq b$ and $2\lambda \leq a+b < 4\lambda$
and that the labels are independent given the set if and only if $a = b =

2D continuum GFF is $-2\lambda$.
  Finally, we discuss the coupling of the labelled CLE$_4$ with the GFF. We
characterise this coupling as a specific local set coupling, and show how to
approximate these local sets. We further see how in these approximations the

only of fundamental quantum optics and applications in quantum information
processing and sensing but also of demonstrations of quantum computational
supremacy in boson sampling experiments relying only on linear optical
interferometers. However, scalable boson sampling experiments with either
photon-number states or squeezed states are challenged by the need to generate
a large number of photons with fixed temporal and frequency spectra from one
experimental run to another. Unfortunately, even the well established standard
multiplexing techniques employed to generate photons with fixed spectral
properties are affected by the detrimental effects of losses, spectral
distorsions and reduction in purity. Here, we employ sampling correlation
measurements in the photonic inner modes, time and frequency, at the
interferometer input and output to ensure the occurrence of multiphoton
interference even with pure states of input photons with random spectral
overlap from one sample to another. Indeed, by introducing a random
multiplexing technique where photons are generated with random inner-mode
parameters, it is possible to substantially enhance the probability to
successfully generate samples and overcome the typical drawbacks in standard
multiplexing. Remarkably, we demonstrate the classical hardness of the
resulting problem of scattershot multiboson correlation sampling based on this
technique. Therefore, these results not only shed new light in the
computational complexity of multiboson interference but also allow us to
enhance the experimental scalability of boson sampling schemes with the
potential of future applications in quantum information processing and sensing
even beyond boson sampling.

difficult, often involving complex spatial integrations, even after performing
the necessary full space solutions to Maxwell's equations. The formal solutions
are termed quasinormal modes which are known to diverge in space, and
additional techniques are frequently required to obtain more accurate field

networks. Our proposed algorithm uses a Maximal Expected Model Change (MEMC)
criterion for querying network nodes label assignments. MEMC detects nodes that
maximally change the community assignment likelihood model following a query.
Our method is inspired by detection in the benchmark Stochastic Block Model
(SBM), where we provide sample complexity analysis and empirical study with SBM
and real network data for binary as well as for the multi-class settings. The
analysis also covers the most challenging case of sparse degree and
below-detection-threshold SBMs, where we observe a super-linear error
reduction. MEMC is shown to be superior to the random selection baseline and
other state-of-the-art active learners.

topology as well as the frequency/power allocation on the wireless links, where
nodes are capable of full-duplex (FD) operation. The proposed joint design
enables the coexistence of multiple wireless links at the same channel,
resulting in an enhanced spectral efficiency. Moreover, it enables the usage of
FD capability when/where it is gainful. In this regard, a
mixed-integer-linear-program (MILP) is proposed, aiming at a minimum cost
design for the wireless backhaul network, considering the required rate demand
at each base station. Moreover, a re-tunning algorithm is proposed which reacts
to the slight changes in the network condition, e.g., channel attenuation or
rate demand, by adjusting the transmit power at the wireless links. In this
regard, a successive inner approximation (SIA)- based design is proposed, where
in each step a convex subproblem is solved. Numerical simulations show a
reduction in the overall network cost via the utilization of the proposed
designs, thanks to the coexistence of multiple wireless links on the same
channel due to the FD capability.

opportunistically access the primary users (PUs) spectrum to improve the
spectrum utilization; however, this increases the interference levels at the
PUs. In this paper, we consider an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
OFDM-based CR network and investigate the tradeoff between increasing the SU
transmission rate (hence improving the spectrum utilization) and reducing the
interference levels at the PUs. We formulate a new multiobjective optimization
(MOOP) problem that jointly maximizes the SU transmission rate and minimizes
its transmit power, while imposing interference thresholds to the PUs. Further,
we propose an algorithm to strike a balance between the SU transmission rate
and the interference levels to the PUs. The proposed algorithm considers the
practical scenario of knowing partial channel state information (CSI) of the
links between the SU transmitter and the PUs receivers. Simulation results
illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and its superiority when
compared to the work in the literature.

results, several series involving hyperbolic functions are evaluated and
expressed in terms of $z={}_2F_1(1/2,1/2;1;x)$ and $z'=dz/dx$. When a certain
parameter in these series is equal to $\pi$ the series are expressed in closed
form in terms of some special values of the Gamma function. Moreover, many new
illustrative examples are presented.

solvers and Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM). In the DDM framework, the
boundary conditions can be chosen to be primal, dual or mixed. The mixed
approach presents the advantage to be eligible for the research of an optimal
interface parameter (often called impedance) which can increase the convergence
rate. The optimal value for this parameter is often too expensive to be
computed exactly in practice: an approximate version has to be sought for,
along with a compromise between efficiency and computational cost. In the
context of parallel algorithms for solving nonlinear structural mechanical
problems, we propose a new heuristic for the impedance which combines short and
long range effects at a low computational cost.
