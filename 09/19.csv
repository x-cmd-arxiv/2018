  thermal component for hydrogen-helium envelopes","10 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stz738",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Systems of close-in super-Earths display striking diversity in planetary bulk
density and composition. Giant impacts are expected to play a role in the
formation of many of these worlds. Previous works, focused on the mechanical
shock caused by a giant impact, have shown that these impacts can eject large
fractions of the planetary envelope, offering a partial explanation for the
observed spread in exoplanet compositions. Here, we examine the thermal
consequences of giant impacts, and show that the atmospheric loss caused by
these effects can significantly exceed that caused by mechanical shocks for
hydrogen-helium (H/He) envelopes. When a giant impact occurs, part of the
impact energy is converted into thermal energy, heating the rocky core and the
envelope. We find that the ensuing thermal expansion of the envelope can lead
to a period of sustained, rapid mass loss through a Parker wind, resulting in
the partial or complete erosion of the H/He envelope. The fraction of the
envelope lost depends on the planet's orbital distance from its host star and
its initial thermal state, and hence age. Planets closer to their host stars
are more susceptible to thermal atmospheric loss triggered by impacts than ones
on wider orbits. Similarly, younger planets, with rocky cores which are still
hot and molten from formation, suffer greater atmospheric loss. This is
especially interesting because giant impacts are expected to occur
$10{-}100~\mathrm{Myr}$ after formation. For planets where the thermal energy
of the core is much greater than the envelope energy, the impactor mass
required for significant atmospheric removal is $M_\mathrm{imp} / M_p \sim \mu
/ \mu_c \sim 0.1$, approximately the ratio of the heat capacities of the
envelope and core. When the envelope energy dominates the total energy budget,
complete loss can occur when the impactor mass is comparable to the envelope
mass.

with twist function. The main examples of such models are integrable non-linear
sigma models, such as the Principal Chiral Model, and their deformations. A
first obtained result is the proof that the so-called Bi-Yang-Baxter model,
which is a two-parameter deformation of the Principal Chiral Model, is also a
model with twist function. It is then shown that inhomogeneous Yang-Baxter type
deformations modify certain global symmetries of the undeformed model into
Poisson-Lie symmetries. Another chapter concerns the construction of an
infinite number of local charges in involution for all integrable sigma models
and their deformations : this result is based on the general formalism shared
by all these models as field theories with twist function.
  The second part of the thesis concerns Gaudin models. These are integrable
models associated with Lie algebras. In particular, field theories with twist
function are related to Gaudin models associated with affine Lie algebras. A
standard approach for studying the spectrum of quantum Gaudin models over
finite algebras is the one of Feigin-Frenkel-Reshetikhin. In this thesis,
generalisations of this approach are conjectured, motivated and tested. One of
them deals with the so-called cyclotomic finite Gaudin models. The second one
concerns the Gaudin models associated with affine Lie algebras.

conditional independence tests on the covariance structure meant to
progressively reduce the space of possible causal models. We propose a novel
efficient Bayesian method for discovering the local causal relationships among
triplets of (normally distributed) variables. In our approach, we score the
patterns in the covariance matrix in one go and we incorporate the available
background knowledge in the form of priors over causal structures. Our method
is flexible in the sense that it allows for different types of causal
structures and assumptions. We apply the approach to the task of inferring gene
regulatory networks by learning regulatory relationships between gene
expression levels. We show that our algorithm produces stable and conservative
posterior probability estimates over local causal structures that can be used
to derive an honest ranking of the most meaningful regulatory relationships. We

FCC energies. By computing the leading-order diagrams of the Higgs-parton
scattering cross sections in perturbative QCD, and by embedding the produced
Higgs bosons in an expanding quark-gluon medium modeled with 2D+1 viscous
hydrodynamics with various QCD equations of state, we presented estimates of
the expected scalar boson yields as functions of transverse momentum $p_{\rm

scalar boson yields was predicted due to medium-enhanced $H\to gg,q\bar{q}$
decays, in detriment of the $H\to\gamma\gamma, 4\ell$ channels that are
typically used to observe the Higgs particle. After our work appeared, J.
Ghiglieri and U. Wiedemann \cite{Ghiglieri:2019lzz} have presented

revisit our calculations and to realize of the quantitative importance of

the real ones and of opposite sign. Such virtual corrections significantly
reduce the Higgs-parton ""absorption"" cross sections originally computed in Ref.

performance. Past strategies to address this challenge have considered model
adaptation, accent classification with a model selection, alternate
pronunciation lexicon, etc. In this study, we consider a recurrent neural
network (RNN) with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) cost function
trained on multi-accent English data including US (Native), Indian and Hispanic
accents. We exploit dark knowledge from a model trained with the multi-accent
data to train student models under the guidance of both a teacher model and CTC
cost of target transcription. We show that transferring knowledge from a single
RNN-CTC trained model toward a student model, yields better performance than
the stand-alone teacher model. Since the outputs of different trained CTC
models are not necessarily aligned, it is not possible to simply use an
ensemble of CTC teacher models. To address this problem, we train accent
specific models under the guidance of a single multi-accent teacher, which
results in having multiple aligned and trained CTC models. Furthermore, we
train a student model under the supervision of the accent-specific teachers,
resulting in an even further complementary model, which achieves +20.1%
relative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction compared to the baseline trained
without any teacher. Having this effective multi-accent model, we can achieve
further improvement for each accent by adapting the model to each accent. Using
the accent specific model's outputs to regularize the adapting process (i.e., a
knowledge distillation version of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) results in
even superior performance compared to the conventional approach using general
teacher models.

breaks the large spin degeneracy in the hard-core limit, and induces a
Heisenberg exchange term in the spin chain that is much more sensitive to the
local density than that induced by the bare coupling. With an external harmonic
trap, this leads to a very rich magnetic pattern where the anti-ferromagnetic
(AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) correlations can coexist and distribute in highly
tunable regions across the trap. Finally, we propose to detect the
range-induced magnetic order in the tunneling experiment. Our results can be
directly tested in 1D Fermi gases across narrow resonance, and suggest a
convenient route towards the local manipulation of quantum magnetism in cold

merger GW170817 has raised a heated debate concerning the post-merger outflow
structure. Both a relativistic structured jet viewed off-axis and a mildly
relativistic quasi-spherical outflow can explain the observational data of
GW170817 up to ~260 days. We utilize a physically motivated analytic
two-parameter model called the ""boosted fireball"" for the outflow structure
after it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar
coasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure
varying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an
isotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with ""boosted
fireball"" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh
relativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the
afterglow phase. We compute nearly 2,000,000 synchrotron spectra from the
hydrodynamic simulations using the standard synchrotron radiation model. By
making use of scaling relations in the hydrodynamic and radiation equations, we
develop a synthetic light curve generator with an efficient sampling speed.
This allows us to fit the observational data by performing Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) analysis in a 8-dimensional parameter space, consisting of
hydrodynamic parameters, radiation parameters and observational parameters. Our
results favor the relativistic structured jet, with a jet opening angle ~5 deg
and Lorentz factor ~175, viewed from an off-axis angle of 27(+9-3) deg. Due to
parameter degeneracies, we find broad distributions for the explosion energy
E_0, the circumburst density n_0, epsilon_e and epsilon_B. The combination of a
high n_0 and a low epsilon_B can also produce a good fit, indicating that an
extremely low n_0 may not be required for GW170817.

require that a user must not have access to files it did not request, i.e.,
secure caching. First, a centralized coded caching scheme is provided by
jointly optimizing the cache placement and delivery policies. Next, a
decentralized coded caching scheme is developed that does not require the
knowledge of the number of active users during the caching phase. Both schemes
utilize non-perfect secret sharing and one-time pad keying, to guarantee secure
caching. Furthermore, the proposed schemes provide secure delivery as a side
benefit, i.e., any external entity which overhears the transmitted signals
during the delivery phase cannot obtain any information about the database
files. The proposed schemes provide the achievable upper bound on the minimum
delivery sum rate. Lower bounds on the required transmission sum rate are also
derived using cut-set arguments indicating the multiplicative gap between the

data analytics. Complex data analysis programs in areas such as machine
learning and graph analytics often involve control flow, i.e., iterations and
branching. Therefore, systems for advanced analytics should include control
flow constructs that are efficient and easy to use. A natural approach is to
provide imperative control flow constructs similar to those of mainstream
programming languages: while-loops, if-statements, and mutable variables, whose
values can change between iteration steps.
  However, current parallel dataflow systems execute programs written using
imperative control flow constructs by launching a separate dataflow job after
every control flow decision (e.g., for every step of a loop). The performance
of this approach is suboptimal, because (a) launching a dataflow job incurs
scheduling overhead; and (b) it prevents certain optimizations across iteration
steps.
  In this paper, we introduce Labyrinth, a method to compile programs written
using imperative control flow constructs to a single dataflow job, which
executes the whole program, including all iteration steps. This way, we achieve
both efficiency and ease of use. We also conduct an experimental evaluation,
which shows that Labyrinth has orders of magnitude smaller per-iteration-step
overhead than launching new dataflow jobs, and also allows for significant

tracking performance by exploiting the state-of-the-art deep object detection
models. We fine-tune the building blocks of these models with a goal of
balancing the trade-off between robustness and efficiency in an onboard setting
under real-time constraints. Subsequently, we design an architecturally simple
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based diver-detection model that is much
faster than the state-of-the-art deep models yet provides comparable detection
performances. In addition, we validate the performance and effectiveness of the
proposed diver-following modules through a number of field experiments in

analogous phenomena is observed in AdS$_4$, to which we compare and contrast

  First version - comments are welcomed",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A topological superconductor is characterized by having a pairing gap in the
bulk and gapless self-hermitian Majorana modes at its boundary. In one
dimension, these are zero-energy modes bound to the ends, while in two
dimensions these are chiral gapless modes traveling along the edge. Majorana
modes have attracted a lot of interest due to their exotic properties, which
include non-abelian exchange statistics. Progress in realizing topological
superconductivity has been made by combining spin-orbit coupling, conventional
superconductivity, and magnetism. The existence of protected Majorana modes,
however, does not inherently require the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by
magnetic fields. Indeed, pairs of Majorana modes can reside at the boundary of
a \emph{time-reversal-invariant} topological superconductor (TRITOPS). It is
the time-reversal symmetry which then protects this so-called Majorana Kramers'
pair from gapping out. This is analogous to the case of the two-dimensional
topological insulator, with its pair of helical gapless boundary modes,
protected by time-reversal symmetry. Realizing the TRITOPS phase will be a
major step in the study of topological phases of matter. In this paper we
describe the physical properties of the TRITOPS phase, and review recent
proposals for engineering and detecting them in condensed matter systems, in
one and two spatial dimensions. We mostly focus on extrinsic superconductors,
where superconductivity is introduced through the proximity effect. We
emphasize the role of interplay between attractive and repulsive
electron-electron interaction as an underlying mechanism. When discussing the
detection of the TRITOPS phase, we focus on the physical imprint of Majorana
Kramers' pairs, and review proposals of transport measurement which can reveal
their existence.

transitions of O VIII, O VII, Ne IX and N VII. We perform both Gaussian line
fitting and photoionization modelling. Our results suggest that there are two
photoionization gas components, out of pressure equilibrium with respect to
each other. One with ionization parameter of 2.5 and a large opening angle, and
one with 1.3. The second component is possibly covering a smaller fraction of

photoionization modelling, we detect a rather high density plasma of > 10^13

an inflow velocity. We propose a scenario where the high ionization component
constitutes an extended upper atmosphere of the accretion disk. The lower

those stars with radial velocity and proper motion/parallax in agreement with
the cluster mean values. We also discarded one binary not previously

We measured metallicity (the cluster average [Fe/H] is +0.08, rms=0.07) and
abundances of light, {\alpha}, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. The Li
abundance follows the expectations, showing a tight relation between
temperature and abundance on the MS, at variance with M67, and we did not

Statistically, these effects are quantified, for example, in the number counts
of highly luminous sub-millimeter galaxies and of gravitational arcs. Two key
quantities to model these statistics are the magnification and the arc cross
sections. These are usually computed using either the circular infinitesimal
source approximation or ray-tracing simulations for sources of finite size. In
this work, we use an analytic solution for gravitational arcs to obtain these
cross sections as a function of image magnification and length-to-width ratio
in closed form, for finite sources. These analytical solutions provide simple
interpretations to the numerical results, can be employed to test the
computational codes, and can be used for fast a computation of the abundance of
distant sources and arcs. In this paper, the lens is modeled by a Singular
Isothermal Sphere, which is an excellent approximation to radial density
profile of Early-Type galaxies, and the sources are also axisymmetric. We
derive expressions for the geometrical properties of the images, such as the
area and several definitions of length and width. We obtain the magnification
cross section in exact form and derive a simple analytic approximation covering
the arc and Einstein ring regimes. The arc cross section is obtained down to
the formation of an Einstein ring and given in terms of elementary functions.
Perturbative expansions of these results are worked out, showing explicitly the

pathways to a nonlinear optical process within the device, which quantum
mechanically interfere to drive the system between states in the time domain.
The coherent conversion entangles the generated biphoton states between
propagation pathways, leading to cyclically evolving path-entanglement and the
manifestation of coherent oscillations in second-order temporal correlations.
Furthermore, the rich device physics is harnessed to tune properties of the
quantum states. In particular, we show that the strength of interference
between pathways can be coherently controlled, allowing for manipulation of the
degree of entanglement, which can even be entirely quenched. The states can
likewise be made to flip-flop between exhibiting initially correlated or

spiral galaxies under the LOESS+SIMEX technique. In order to compare methods we
also perform the parametric approach assuming core and cuspy dark matter (DM)
profiles: PISO, NFW, Burkert, Spano, the soliton and two fuzzy soliton$+$NFW.
As result of this two approaches, a comparison of the RC obtained is carried
out by computing the distance between central curves and the distance between
1$\sigma$ error bands. Furthermore, we perform a model selection according to
two statistical criteria, the BIC and the value of $\chi^2_{red}$. We work with
two groups. The first one is a comparison between PISO, NFW, Spano and Burkert
showing that Spano is the most favored model satisfying our selection criteria.
For the second group we select soliton, NFW and Fuzzy models, resulting the
soliton as the best model. Moreover according to the statistical tools and
non-parametric reconstruction we are able to classify galaxies as core or cusp.
Finally, using an MCMC method, we compute for each of the DM models the
characteristic surface density, $\mu_{DM}=\rho_s r_s$, and the mass within 300
pc. We found that there is a common mass for spiral galaxies of the order of
$10^7$ M$_\odot$, which is in agreement with results for dSph Milky Way
satellites, independent of the model. This result is also consistent with our
finding that there is a constant characteristic volume density of haloes.
Finally, we also find that $\mu_{DM}$ is not constant, which is in tension with
previous literature.

relic abundance is model-dependent, and in principle could be only indirectly
related to direct detection, it is interesting to consider the implications of
the former on the latter. In this work we conduct an extended analysis to
include constraints from two natural scenarios of dark matter genesis:
asymmetric dark matter and thermal freeze-out. In the first (second) case, the
dark matter number (energy) densities of the different components are expected
to be similar. In the case of thermal freeze-out, we assume that the global
energy density scales with the local one. In our numerical analysis we analyse
the median sensitivity of direct detection experiments to discriminate a
two-component scenario from a one-component one, and also the precision with
which dark matter parameters can be extracted. We analyse these generic
scenarios for both light and heavy mediators. We find that most scenarios have
a relatively suppressed maximum median sensitivity compared to the previously
studied general cases. We also find that the asymmetric scenario is more
promising than the thermal freeze-out one.

stability of the model becomes potentially sensitive to the dark energy
equation of state parameter $w_x$, and a singularity arises at `$w_x = -1$'.
Thus, it becomes mandatory to test the stability of the model into two separate
regions, namely, for quintessence and phantom. This essentially brings in a
discontinuity into the parameters space for $w_x$. Such discontinuity can be
removed with some specific choices of the interaction or coupling function. In
the present work we choose one particular coupling between dark matter and dark
energy which can successfully remove such instability and we allow a dynamical

particular, considering a dynamical dark energy equation of state with only one
free parameter $w_0$, representing the current value of the dark energy

equation of state is suggested at present. Moreover, for this case the tension
on $H_0$ is clearly released. As a final remark, we mention that according to

the process in terms of the width of the unstable particle produced in the
first decay and determine the limits of validity and violation of the theorem.
One of the conclusions is that the theorem holds in the strict limit of zero
width of that resonance, in which case the strength of the triangle diagram
becomes negligible compared to the tree level. Another conclusion, on the
practical side, is that for realistic values of the width, the triangle
singularity can provide a strength comparable or even bigger than the tree
level, which indicates that invoking the Schmid theorem to neglect the triangle

Methods using RGB-D data have shown great success in solving this problem.
However, there are situations where cost constraints or the working environment
may limit the use of RGB-D sensors. When limited to monocular camera data only,
the problem of object pose estimation is very challenging. In this work, we
introduce a novel method called SilhoNet that predicts 6D object pose from
monocular images. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pipeline that
takes in Region of Interest (ROI) proposals to simultaneously predict an
intermediate silhouette representation for objects with an associated occlusion
mask and a 3D translation vector. The 3D orientation is then regressed from the
predicted silhouettes. We show that our method achieves better overall
performance on the YCB-Video dataset than two state-of-the art networks for 6D
pose estimation from monocular image input.

(WFC3) transmission spectra is performed using a hierarchy of nested-sampling
retrievals: with versus without clouds, grey versus non-grey clouds, isothermal
versus non-isothermal transit chords and with water, hydrogen cyanide and/or
ammonia. We revisit the ""normalisation degeneracy"": the relative abundances of
molecules are degenerate at the order-of-magnitude level with the absolute
normalisation of the transmission spectrum. Using a suite of mock retrievals,
we demonstrate that the normalisation degeneracy may be partially broken using
WFC3 data alone, even in the absence of optical/visible data and without
appealing to the presence of patchy clouds, although lower limits to the mixing
ratios may be prior-dominated depending on the measurement uncertainties. With
James Webb Space Telescope-like spectral resolutions, the normalisation
degeneracy may be completely broken from infrared spectra alone. We find no
trend in the retrieved water abundances across nearly two orders of magnitude
in exoplanet mass and a factor of 5 in retrieved temperature (about 500 to 2500
K). We further show that there is a general lack of strong Bayesian evidence to
support interpretations of non-grey over grey clouds (only for WASP-69b and
WASP-76b) and non-isothermal over isothermal atmospheres (no objects). 35 out
of 38 WFC3 transmission spectra are well-fitted by an isothermal transit chord
with grey clouds and water only, while 8 are adequately explained by flat
lines. Generally, the cloud composition is unconstrained.

useful tool to diagnose if features (or dimensions) of the investigated
stimulus are processed in a parallel or serial fashion. In order to use SFT,
one has to assume the speed to process each feature is influenced by that
feature only, termed as selective influence (Sternberg, 1969). This assumption
is usually untestable as the processing time for a stimulus feature is not
observable. Stochastic dominance is traditionally used as an indirect evidence
for selective influence (e.g., Townsend & Fifi\'c, 2004). However, one should
keep in mind that selective influence may be violated even when stochastic
dominance holds. The current study proposes a trackball movement paradigm for a
direct test of selective influence. The participants were shown a reference
stimulus and a test stimulus simultaneously on a computer screen. They were
asked to use the trackball to adjust the test stimulus until it appeared to
match the position or shape of the reference stimulus. We recorded the reaction
time, the parameters defined the reference stimulus (denoted as \alpha and
\beta ), and the parameters defined the test stimulus (denoted as A and B). We
tested selective influence of \alpha and \beta on the amount of time to adjust
A and B through testing selective influence of \alpha and \beta on the values
of A and B using the linear feasibility test (Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2010). We
found that when the test was passed and stochastic dominance held, the inferred
architecture was as expected, which was further confirmed by the trajectory of
A and B observed in each trial. However, with stochastic dominance only SFT can
suggest a prohibited architecture. Our results indicate the proposed method is
more reliable for testing selective influence on the processing speed than
examining stochastic dominance only.

the nonlinear coupling in the differential equations governing the dynamics of
the phase and the modulus of the order parameter. The appearance of the rapid

the phase of the order parameter in the transient stage. FIPT is also studied
for multi-sheeted Sauter pulse with linear and quadratic frequency chirp. QEEP

oscillations due to the frequency chirp. The formation of pre-transient region
due to the quadratic frequency chirping is observed in the accelerating part of
the QEPP stage before the electric field attains the maximum value. As the
quadratic chirp is increased the pre-transient and transient stages move closer
to the electric field maximum which leads to a decrease in temporal separation
between the two stages. The early appearance of the transient stage and hence

stochastic approximation techniques. If, in addition, the input and output
quantizers have computational and storage capabilities, strongly consistent
identification schemes are proposed which can handle arbitrary input and noise
distributions. In this case, some conditional expectation terms are computed at

long challenged human efforts to understand and manipulate them, from the

introduce a theoretical principle, broadly generalizing Euler's
{\emph{elastica}} -- a core concept of continuum mechanics that invokes the
energetic preference of bending over straining a thin solid object and has been
widely applied to classical and modern studies of beams and rods. We define a
class of {\emph{geometrically incompatible confinement}} problems, whereby the
topography imposed on a thin solid body is incompatible with its intrinsic
(""target"") metric and, as a consequence of Gauss' {\emph{Theorema Egregium}},
induces strain. Focusing on a prototypical example of a sheet attached to a
spherical substrate, numerical simulations and analytical study demonstrate
that the mechanics is governed by a principle, which we call the ""Gauss-Euler
{\emph{elastica}}"". This emergent rule states that - despite the unavoidable
strain in such an incompatible confinement - the ratio between the energies
stored in straining and bending the solid may be arbitrarily small. The
Gauss-Euler {\emph{elastica}} underlies a theoretical framework that greatly
simplifies the daunting task of solving the highly nonlinear equations that
describe thin solids at mechanical equilibrium. This development thus opens new
possibilities for attacking a broad class of phenomena governed by the coupling
of geometry and mechanics.

devices, but under strong confinement these materials exhibit changes in their
mechanical properties which are not well understood. Phenomenological models
explain these properties by postulating an underlying defect structure in these
materials but do not detail the microscopic properties of these defects. Using
machine learning methods, we identify mesoscale defects that lead to shear
banding in polymer nanopillars well below the glass transition temperature as a
function of pillar diameter. Our results show that the primary structural
features responsible for shear banding on this scale are fluctuations in the
diameter of the pillar. Surprisingly, these fluctuations are quite small
compared to the diameter of the pillar, less than half of a particle diameter
in size. At intermediate pillar diameters, we find that these fluctuations tend
to concentrate along the minor axis of shear band planes. We also see the
importance of mean softness as a classifier of shear banding grow as a function
of pillar diameter. Softness is a new field that characterizes local structure
and is highly correlated with particle-level dynamics such that softer
particles are more likely to rearrange. This demonstrates that softness, a
quantity that relates particle-level structure to dynamics on short time and
length scales, can predict large time and length scale phenomena related to
material failure.

of known and new protocol exploits. Although the security has been enhanced
when compared to previous generations to tackle known protocol exploits, our
analysis identifies some potentially unrealistic system assumptions that are
critical for security as well as a number protocol edge cases that could render
5G systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For example, null encryption and
null authentication are supported and can be used in valid system
configurations, and certain key security functions are still left outside of
the scope of the specifications. Moreover, the prevention of pre-authentcation
message exploits appears to rely on the implicit assumption of impractical
carrier and roaming agreements and the management of public keys from all
global operators. In parallel, existing threats such as International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers are prevented only if the serving network
enforces optional security features and if the UE knows the public key of the
home network operator. The comparison with 4G LTE protocol exploits reveals
that the 5G security specifications, as of Release 15, do not fully address the
user privacy and network availability concerns, where one edge case can
compromise the privacy, security and availability of 5G users and services.

condensin and cohesin that stochastically generate loops within and between

explore the ability of transient, protein-mediated, gene-gene crosslinks to
induce clusters of genes, thereby dynamic architecture, within the highly
repeated ribosomal DNA that comprises the nucleolus of budding yeast. We
implement three approaches: live cell microscopy; computational modeling of the
full genome during G1 in budding yeast, exploring four decades of timescales
for transient crosslinks between 5k bp domains in the nucleolus on Chromosome
XII; and, temporal network models with automated community detection algorithms
applied to the full range of 4D modeling datasets. The data analysis tools
detect and track gene clusters, their size, number, persistence time, and their
plasticity. Of biological significance, our analysis reveals an optimal mean
crosslink lifetime that promotes pairwise and cluster gene interactions through
""flexible"" clustering. In this state, large gene clusters self-assemble yet
frequently interact, marked by gene exchanges between clusters, which in turn
maximizes global gene interactions in the nucleolus. This regime stands between
two limiting cases each with far less global gene interactions: with shorter
crosslink lifetimes, ""rigid"" clustering emerges with clusters that interact
infrequently; with longer crosslink lifetimes, there is a dissolution of
clusters. These observations are compared with imaging experiments on a normal
yeast strain and two condensin-modified mutant cell strains, applying the same
image analysis pipeline to the experimental and simulated datasets.

skills and contributions of all workers involved, which may be unknown to both
the platform and the client who posted the job. These team matchings result in
a structured correlation between what is known about the individuals and this

natural settings where the performance of a team is dictated by its strongest

exploration-exploitation tradeoff between learning the performance of untested
teams and repeating previously tested teams that resulted in a good
performance. We establish fundamental regret bounds and design near-optimal
algorithms that uncover several insights into these tradeoffs.

indexed by cyclic groups and is covered in the present article; the second
family will be the content of a follow-up article. Via a Tannaka-Krein result,
the categories in the two families correspond to easy quantum groups
interpolating the classical unitary group and Wang's free unitary quantum
group. In fact, they are all half-liberated in some sense and our results imply
that there are many more half-liberation procedures than previously expected.

\cite{zhangShu_2010a,zhangShu_2010b}, we develop a realizability-preserving
method to simulate the transport of particles (fermions) through a background
material using a two-moment model that evolves the angular moments of a phase
space distribution function $f$. The two-moment model is closed using algebraic
moment closures; e.g., as proposed by Cernohorsky \& Bludman
\cite{cernohorskyBludman_1994} and Banach \& Larecki
\cite{banachLarecki_2017a}. Variations of this model have recently been used to
simulate neutrino transport in nuclear astrophysics applications, including
core-collapse supernovae and compact binary mergers. We employ the
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for spatial discretization (in part to
capture the asymptotic diffusion limit of the model) combined with
implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration to stably bypass short timescales
induced by frequent interactions between particles and the background.
Appropriate care is taken to ensure the method preserves strict algebraic
bounds on the evolved moments (particle density and flux) as dictated by
Pauli's exclusion principle, which demands a bounded distribution function
(i.e., $f\in[0,1]$). This realizability-preserving scheme combines a suitable
CFL condition, a realizability-enforcing limiter, a closure procedure based on
Fermi-Dirac statistics, and an IMEX scheme whose stages can be written as a
convex combination of forward Euler steps combined with a backward Euler step.
Numerical results demonstrate the realizability-preserving properties of the
scheme. We also demonstrate that the use of algebraic moment closures not based
on Fermi-Dirac statistics can lead to unphysical moments in the context of
fermion transport.

greedy algorithm is designed to search through all possible schedules to pick
the best that minimizes a cost function based on a trade-off between total
delay and variance in delay. A simulator software is designed to compare the
results of the proposed policy in terms of average delay per vehicle and
variance in delay with that of a 4-phase traffic light.

with two qudit nearest-neighbor gates on a $D$-dimensional lattice with n
qudits are approximate $t$-designs in various measures. These include the
""monomial"" measure, meaning that the monomials of a random circuit from this
family have expectation close to the value that would result from the Haar
measure. Previously, the best bound was $poly(t)\cdot n$ due to
Brandao-Harrow-Horodecki (BHH) for $D=1$. We also improve the ""scrambling"" and
""decoupling"" bounds for spatially local random circuits due to Brown and Fawzi.
  One consequence of our result is that assuming the polynomial hierarchy (PH)
is infinite and that certain counting problems are $\#P$-hard on average,
sampling within total variation distance from these circuits is hard for
classical computers. Previously, exact sampling from the outputs of even
constant-depth quantum circuits was known to be hard for classical computers
under the assumption that PH is infinite. However, to show the hardness of
approximate sampling using this strategy requires that the quantum circuits
have a property called ""anti-concentration"", meaning roughly that the output
has near-maximal entropy. Unitary 2-designs have the desired anti-concentration
property. Thus our result improves the required depth for this level of
anti-concentration from linear depth to a sub-linear value, depending on the
geometry of the interactions. This is relevant to a recent proposal by the
Google Quantum AI group to perform such a sampling task with 49 qubits on a
two-dimensional lattice and confirms their conjecture that $O(\sqrt n)$ depth
suffices for anti-concentration. We also prove that anti-concentration is
possible in depth O(log(n) loglog(n)) using a different model.

the use of implicit regularisation allows the algorithm to remain simple,
without projections or dual methods. To prove our results, we establish
graph-independent generalisation bounds for Distributed SGD that match the

apparently continued through the Archean and perhaps beyond. Previous models
that explain Xe fractionation by hydrodynamic hydrogen escape cannot gracefully
explain how Xe escaped when Ar and Kr did not, nor allow Xe to escape in the
Archean. Here we show that Xe is the only noble gas that can escape as an ion
in a photo-ionized hydrogen wind, possible in the absence of a geomagnetic
field or along polar magnetic field lines that open into interplanetary space.
To quantify the hypothesis we construct new 1-D models of hydrodynamic
diffusion-limited hydrogen escape from highly-irradiated CO$_2$-H$_2$-H
atmospheres. The models reveal three minimum requirements for Xe escape: solar
EUV irradiation needs to exceed $10\times$ that of the modern Sun; the total
hydrogen mixing ratio in the atmosphere needs to exceed 1% (equiv. to 0.5%
CH$_4$); and transport amongst the ions in the lower ionosphere needs to lift
the Xe ions to the base of the outflowing hydrogen corona. The long duration of
Xe escape implies that, if a constant process, Earth lost the hydrogen from at
least one ocean of water, roughly evenly split between the Hadean and the
Archean. However, to account for both Xe's fractionation and also its depletion
with respect to Kr and primordial $^{244}$Pu, Xe escape must have been limited
to small apertures or short episodes, which suggests that Xe escape was
restricted to polar windows by a geomagnetic field, or dominated by outbursts
of high solar activity, or limited to transient episodes of abundant hydrogen,
or a combination of these. Xenon escape stopped when the hydrogen (or methane)
mixing ratio became too small, or EUV radiation from the aging Sun became too
weak, or charge exchange between Xe$^+$ and O$_2$ rendered Xe neutral.

for solving large-scale Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problems.
Each local submap is independently built using the local information through
solving a small-scale SLAM; the joining of submaps mainly involves solving
linear least squares and performing nonlinear coordinate transformations.
Through approximating the local submap information as the state estimate and
its corresponding information matrix, judiciously selecting the submap
coordinate frames, and approximating the joining of a large number of submaps
by joining only two maps at a time, either sequentially or in a more efficient
Divide and Conquer manner, the nonlinear optimization process involved in most
of the existing submap joining approaches is avoided. Thus the proposed submap
joining algorithm does not require initial guess or iterations since linear
least squares problems have closed-form solutions. The proposed Linear SLAM
technique is applicable to feature-based SLAM, pose graph SLAM and D-SLAM, in
both two and three dimensions, and does not require any assumption on the
character of the covariance matrices. Simulations and experiments are performed
to evaluate the proposed Linear SLAM algorithm. Results using publicly
available datasets in 2D and 3D show that Linear SLAM produces results that are
very close to the best solutions that can be obtained using full nonlinear
optimization algorithm started from an accurate initial guess. The C/C++ and
MATLAB source codes of Linear SLAM are available on OpenSLAM.

configuration space. Hence, we propose a novel framework, called FastDeepIoT,
that uncovers the non-linear relation between neural network structure and

that significantly improve the trade-off between execution time and accuracy on
mobile and embedded devices. FastDeepIoT makes two key contributions. First,
FastDeepIoT automatically learns an accurate and highly interpretable execution
time model for deep neural networks on the target device. This is done without
prior knowledge of either the hardware specifications or the detailed
implementation of the used deep learning library. Second, FastDeepIoT informs a
compression algorithm how to minimize execution time on the profiled device
without impacting accuracy. We evaluate FastDeepIoT using three different
sensing-related tasks on two mobile devices: Nexus 5 and Galaxy Nexus.
FastDeepIoT further reduces the neural network execution time by $48\%$ to
$78\%$ and energy consumption by $37\%$ to $69\%$ compared with the

NASA airfoil by solving the two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations for a range of transonic Mach numbers and angles of attack, using
turbulence compressible KW SST model. The height of the gurney flap was
selected to be 1.65 percent chord length. A high-resolution mesh was applied to
accurately predict the flow field specifically in the vicinity of the airfoil.
Below the drag divergence Mach number, the gurney flap has a remarkable
influence on the aerodynamic coefficients especially at -1 and 0 degrees angle
of attack resulting in 50 percent increase in L over D ratio. At high Mach
numbers and angles of attack, Gurney flap loses its effects and the clean
airfoil has better aerodynamic performance since it significantly boosts both
the pressure and shear drag. It was observed that the gurney flap mitigates the
transonic lambda shock on both surfaces of the airfoil. Moreover, it alters the
Kutta condition by changing the separation point location at the trailing edge
which provides the airfoil more bound circulation and lift force.

systems and the rapid advance of technology have established new scenarios in
the operation of low-voltage networks. In particular, recent trends in
cryptocurrencies and blockchain have led to a proliferation of peer-to-peer
(P2P) energy trading schemes, which allow the exchange of energy between the
neighbors without any intervention of a conventional intermediary in the
transactions. Nevertheless, far too little attention has been paid to the
technical constraints of the network under this scenario. A major challenge to
implementing P2P energy trading is that of ensuring that network constraints
are not violated during the energy exchange. This paper proposes a methodology
based on sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of P2P transactions on the
network and to guarantee an exchange of energy that does not violate network
constraints. The proposed method is tested on a typical UK low-voltage network.
The results show that our method ensures that energy is exchanged between users
under the P2P scheme without violating the network constraints, and that users
can still capture the economic benefits of the P2P architecture.

can in some cases facilitate in utero interventions. In practice, however, the
fetal diagnosis rate for these lesions is only 30-50 percent in community
settings. Improving fetal diagnosis of congenital heart disease is therefore
critical. Deep learning is a cutting-edge machine learning technique for
finding patterns in images but has not yet been applied to prenatal diagnosis
of congenital heart disease. Using 685 retrospectively collected
echocardiograms from fetuses 18-24 weeks of gestational age from 2000-2018, we
trained convolutional and fully-convolutional deep learning models in a
supervised manner to (i) identify the five canonical screening views of the
fetal heart and (ii) segment cardiac structures to calculate fetal cardiac
biometrics. We then trained models to distinguish by view between normal
hearts, TOF, and HLHS. In a holdout test set of images, F-score for
identification of the five most important fetal cardiac views was 0.95. Binary
classification of unannotated cardiac views of normal heart vs. TOF reached an
overall sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, while normal vs. HLHS
reached a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%, both well above average
diagnostic rates for these lesions. Furthermore, segmentation-based
measurements for cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), cardiac axis (CA), and ventricular
fractional area change (FAC) were compatible with clinically measured metrics
for normal, TOF, and HLHS hearts. Thus, using guideline-recommended imaging,

phase matching. The two conditions yield quantitative predictions for the onset
cell density and frequency in terms of measured single-cell and signal response

that these structures correspond to anticyclonic vortices generated by the
Rossby wave instability within the gaseous disk. Such vortices have local gas
over-densities and are expected to concentrate dust particles with Stokes
number around unity. This process might catalyze the formation of
planetesimals. Whereas recent observations showed that dust crescent are indeed
regions where millimeter-size particles have abnormally high concentration
relative to the gas and smaller grains, no observations have yet shown that the
gas within the crescent region counter-rotates with respect to the
protoplanetary disk. Here we investigate the detectability of anticyclonic
features through measurement of the line-of-sight component of the gas velocity
obtained with ALMA. We carry out 2D hydrodynamic simulations and 3D radiative

which couples the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and the Discrete Element
Method (DEM) using an immersed moving boundary technique. Similar algorithms
have been reported in the past decade, however, the roles of major model
parameters are yet to be fully understood. To examine various numerical errors,
a series of benchmark cases with a wide range of Reynolds number are performed,
starting from a single stationary particle to multiple moving particles. It is
found that for flow with low and intermediate Reynolds numbers, 20 fluid cells
per one particle diameter are necessary to achieve sufficient accuracy (within
5%). For a flow with high Reynolds number, a turbulence model shall be
incorporated so that the effects of unresolved small eddies can be captured in
an accurate and efficient manner. Besides, the LBM-DEM results are also
sensitive to the relaxation time, especially when the spatial resolution is
inadequate. A large relaxation time can introduce additional diffusion of fluid
momentum into the fluid-particle system, leading to weakened hydrodynamic
interactions. By choosing a small relaxation time greater than the lower limit
0.5, a small fluid compressibility error and a strong coupling between fluids
and particles can be achieved, at the cost of computational effort. The test
cases also demonstrate the capability of LBM-DEM to describe the rheology of
particle suspensions by capturing the pore-scale hydrodynamic interactions.
Finally, a guideline for quickly establishing a high-quality LBM-DEM model is
provided.

non-magnetic ground state. The present work investigates the Seebeck
coefficient (S) of Fe2VAl in the temperature region 300 to 620 K with the help
of experimental and theoretical tools. The experimental value of S is observed
-130 {\mu}V/K at 300 K. Afterthat, the magnitude of S decreases gradually as
the temperature increases. At T = 620 K, the value of S is found to be -26
{\mu}V/K. In order to understand the behaviour of the experimentally observed S
value, the band-structure and density of states calculations are performed by
using LDA, PBE, PBEsol, mBJ and SCAN within density functional theory. All the
above mentioned exchange-correlation (XC) functionals (except mBJ) predict the
semi-metal like behaviour of the compound, whereas the mBJ gives the indirect
band gap of 0.22 eV having the well agreement with experimentally observed
value. The temperature dependence of S for Fe2VAl is also calculated with the
help of all the five mentioned functionals individually. The best XC functional
is investigated for searching the new thermoelectric materials by taking Fe2VAl
as a case example through this study. The best matching between experimental
and calculated values of S as a function of temperature is observed by setting
the mBJ band gap with the band-structure of PBEsol or SCAN. Therefore, the
present study suggests that the band-structure of PBEsol or SCAN with mBJ band
gap can be used for searching the new thermoelectric materials.

exploits batch normalization to remove the correlation effect in a simple yet

today. This inconsistency remains and amplifies in the presence of a phantom
dark energy equation of state parameter ($w < -1$). However it can be avoided
for $w >-1$. We also find that any modified gravity model with the required
decreasing $G_{\rm eff}(z)$ and $G_{{\rm eff},0}=G$, would have a
characteristic signature in its growth index $\gamma$ with $0.61\lesssim
\gamma_0\lesssim 0.69$ and large slopes $\gamma_0'$, $0.16\lesssim

various apps. The analysis of apps' audit logs is one of the essential methods
for some device manufacturers to unveil the underlying malice within apps. We
propose and implement AppAngio, a novel system that reveals contextual
information in Android app behaviors by API-level audit logs. Our goal is to
help analysts of device manufactures understand what has happened on users'
devices and facilitate the identification of the malice within apps. The key
module of AppAngio is identifying the path matched with the logs on the app's
control-flow graph (CFG). The challenge, however, is that the limited-quantity
logs may incur high computational complexity in the log matching, where there
are a large number of candidates caused by the coupling relation of successive
logs. To address the challenge, we propose a divide and conquer strategy that
precisely positions the nodes matched with log records on the corresponding
CFGs and connects the nodes with as few backtracks as possible. Our experiments
show that AppAngio reveals the contextual information of behaviors in
real-world apps. Moreover, the revealed results assist the analysts in
identifying malice of app behaviors and complement existing analysis schemes.
Meanwhile, AppAngio incurs negligible performance overhead on the Android
device.

abnormal traffic usually affects multiple network domains. Thus, a cross-domain
attack detection has been proposed to improve detection performance. However,
when participating in detection, the domain of each SDN needs to provide a
large amount of real traffic data, from which private information may be

guarantees by sacrificing accuracy or increasing the time cost. Achieving both
high accuracy and reasonable time consumption is a challenging task. In this
paper, we propose Predis, which is a privacypreserving cross-domain attack

encryption to protect privacy and employs a computationally simple and

For the thermal radiation, we employ the emission from the QGP and hadronic

We find that the ""bare"" $G$ is ""screened"" by thermal fluctuations, in the sense

prevalent and popular motion-planning techniques for two decades now.
Surprisingly, in spite of its centrality, there has been an active debate under
which conditions RRT is probabilistically complete. We provide two new proofs
of probabilistic completeness (PC) of RRT with a reduced set of assumptions.
The first one for the purely geometric setting, where we only require that the
solution path has a certain clearance from the obstacles. For the kinodynamic
case with forward propagation of random controls and duration, we only consider
in addition mild Lipschitz-continuity conditions. These proofs fill a gap in
the study of RRT itself. They also lay sound foundations for a variety of more
recent and alternative sampling-based methods, whose PC property relies on that
of RRT.
  Our original publication contains an error in the analysis of the case of the
kinodynamic RRT. Here, we rectify the problem by modifying the proof of Theorem
2, which, in particular, necessitated a revision of Lemma 3. Briefly, the
original (and erroneous) proof of Theorem 2 used a sequence of equal-size
balls. The correction uses a sequence of balls of increasing radii. We

for building recommender systems in industrial settings, owing to its
interpretability and efficiency in real-time personalization. It builds a
user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items
that are similar to the user's profile. As such, the key to an item-based CF
method is in the estimation of item similarities. Early approaches use
statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to
estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored
optimization for the recommendation task. In recent years, several works
attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as
an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a
recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made
to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been
relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based
CF.
  In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item
Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF. The key to our design of NAIS is an
attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in
a user profile are more important for a prediction. Compared to the
state-of-the-art item-based CF method Factored Item Similarity Model (FISM),
our NAIS has stronger representation power with only a few additional
parameters brought by the attention network. Extensive experiments on two
public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NAIS. This work is the first
attempt that designs neural network models for item-based CF, opening up new
research possibilities for future developments of neural recommender systems.

with small communication and entanglement, and short depth circuit for encoding
or decoding. We introduce two new methods to achieve this, the first method
involving two new versions of convex-split lemma that use small amount of
additional resource (in comparison to prior version) and the second method
being inspired by the technique of classical correlated sampling in computer
science. These lead to a series of new consequences, as follows.
  First, we consider the task of quantum decoupling, where the aim is to apply
an operation on a n-qubit register so as to make it independent of an
inaccessible quantum system. Many previous works achieve decoupling with the
aid of a random unitary. It is known that random unitaries can be replaced by
random circuits of size O(n\log n) and depth poly(\log n), or unitary 2-designs
based on Clifford circuits of similar size and depth. We show that given any
choice of basis such as the computational basis, decoupling can be achieved by
a unitary that takes basis vectors to basis vectors. Thus, the circuit acts in
a `classical' manner and additionally uses O(n) catalytic qubits in maximally
mixed quantum state. Our unitary performs addition and multiplication modulo a
prime and hence achieves a circuit size of O(n\log n) and logarithmic depth.
This shows that the circuit complexity of integer multiplication (modulo a
prime) is lower bounded by the optimal circuit complexity of decoupling.
  Next, we construct a new one-shot entanglement-assisted protocol for quantum
channel coding that achieves near-optimal communication through a given
channel. The number of qubits of pre-shared entanglement is exponentially
smaller than that in the previous protocol near-optimal in communication. We
also achieve similar results for one-shot quantum state redistribution.

such CCOs. Based on magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the post core-collapse
supernova phase during the hypercritical accretion episode, we argue that the
magnetic field of a newborn neutron star could have been early buried. During
this phase, thermal neutrinos are created mainly by the pair annihilation,
plasmon decay, photo-neutrino emission and other processes. We study the
dynamics of these neutrinos in this environment and also estimate the number
expected of the neutrino events with their flavor ratios on Earth. The neutrino
burst is the only viable observable that could provide compelling evidence of
the hypercritical phase and therefore, the hidden magnetic field mechanism as
the most favorable scenario to explain the anomalous low magnetic fields
estimated for CCOs.

constituting a precise and cheap alternative to X-imaging. The principle is to
excite a body to reconstruct with a pulse inducing an inhomogeneous heating and
therefore expansion of tissues. This creates an acoustic wave pressure which is
measured with sensors. The reconstruction of heterogeneities inside the body
can be then performed by solving an inverse problem, knowing measurements of
the acoustic waves outside the body. As the intensity of the measured pressure
is expected to be small, a challenging problem consists in locating the sensors
in a adequate way. This paper is devoted to the determination of an optimal
sensors location to achieve this reconstruction. We first introduce a model
involving a least square functional standing for an observation of the pressure
for a first series of measures by sensors, and an observability-like constant
functional describing for the quality of reconstruction. Then, we determine an
appropriate location of sensors for two series of measures, in two steps:
first, we reconstruct possible initial data by solving a worst-case design like
problem. Second, we determine from the knowledge of these initial conditions
the optimal location of sensors for observing in the best way the corresponding
solution of the wave equation. Far from providing an intrinsic solution to the
general issue of locating sensors, solving this problem allows to determine a
new sensors location improving the quality of reconstruction before getting a
new series of measures. We perform a mathematical analysis of this model: in
particular we investigate existence issues and introduce a numerical algorithm
to solve it. Eventually, several numerical 2D simulations illustrate our
approach.

solutions that can effectively leverage the rich signal in multimedia data is

learning, recent advance on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on
exploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To
date, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of
multimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia
recommendation.
  In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender
system. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image
features, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a
small (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease
the recommendation accuracy. This implies the possible weakness of multimedia
recommender system in predicting user preference, and more importantly, the
potential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we propose a
novel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can
lead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial
learning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds
perturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's
accuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia
recommendation tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product
recommendation. Extensive results verify the positive effect of adversarial

degree of error. This study explores the impact of ignoring measurement error,
and proposes methods to improve statistical inference in the presence of
measurement error. Three main types of measurement error in continuous
endpoints are considered: classical, systematic and differential. For each
measurement error type, a corrected effect estimator is proposed. The corrected
estimators and several methods for confidence interval estimation are tested in
a simulation study. These methods combine information about error-prone and
error-free measurements of the endpoint in individuals not included in the
trial (external calibration sample). We show that if measurement error in
continuous endpoints is ignored, the treatment effect estimator is unbiased
when measurement error is classical, while Type-II error is increased at a
given sample size. Conversely, the estimator can be substantially biased when
measurement error is systematic or differential. In those cases, bias can
largely be prevented and inferences improved upon using information from an
external calibration sample, of which the required sample size increases as the
strength of the association between the error-prone and error-free endpoint
decreases. Measurement error correction using already a small (external)
calibration sample is shown to improve inferences and should be considered in
trials with error-prone endpoints. Implementation of the proposed correction
methods is accommodated by a new software package for R.

human annotators perform instance segmentation. Human annotators copy the

Hence, the edges of instance masks are particularly useful as they characterize
the instance well. The Edge Agreement Head therefore encourages predicted masks
to have similar image gradients to the ground-truth mask using edge detection
filters. We provide a detailed survey of loss combinations and show
improvements on the MS COCO Mask metrics compared to using no additional loss.
Our approach marginally increases the model size and adds no additional

modeling compared to sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models which tend to
generate generic and repetitive responses. Despite so, training latent variable
models remains to be difficult. In this paper, we propose Latent Topic
Conversational Model (LTCM) which augments seq2seq with a neural latent topic
component to better guide response generation and make training easier. The
neural topic component encodes information from the source sentence to build a
global ""topic"" distribution over words, which is then consulted by the seq2seq
model at each generation step. We study in details how the latent
representation is learnt in both the vanilla model and LTCM. Our extensive
experiments contribute to better understanding and training of conditional
latent models for languages. Our results show that by sampling from the learnt
latent representations, LTCM can generate diverse and interesting responses. In
a subjective human evaluation, the judges also confirm that LTCM is the overall
preferred option.

NOMA play in massive MIMO? It is well-established that power-domain
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes can outperform conventional
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes in cellular networks. However, this
fact does not imply that NOMA is the most efficient way to communicate in
massive MIMO setups, where the base stations have many more antennas than there
are users in the cell. These setups are becoming the norm in future networks
and are usually studied by assuming spatial multiplexing of the users using
linear multi-user beamforming. To answer the above question, we analyze and
compare the performance achieved by NOMA and multi-user beamforming in both
NLOS and LOS scenarios. We reveal that the latter scheme gives the highest
average sum rate in massive MIMO setups. We also identify specific cases where
NOMA is the better choice in massive MIMO and explain how NOMA plays an
essential role in creating a hybrid of NOMA and multi-user beamforming that is
shown to perform better than two standalone schemes do.

significantly smaller than the ground sampling distance of a satellite image.
This task is hard due to the cluttered nature of scenes where different object
categories occur. Target objects can be partially occluded, vary in appearance
within the same class and look alike to different categories. Since traditional
object detection is infeasible due to the small size of objects with respect to
the pixel size, we cast object counting as a density estimation problem. To
distinguish objects of different classes, our approach combines density
estimation with semantic segmentation in an end-to-end learnable convolutional
neural network (CNN). Experiments show that deep semantic density estimation
can robustly count objects of various classes in cluttered scenes. Experiments
also suggest that we need specific CNN architectures in remote sensing instead
of blindly applying existing ones from computer vision.

learning methods employ feed-forward architectures, and thus the dependencies
between LR and HR images are not fully exploited, leading to limited learning
performance. Moreover, most deep learning based SR methods apply the pixel-wise
reconstruction error as the loss, which, however, may fail to capture
high-frequency information and produce perceptually unsatisfying results,
whilst the recent perceptual loss relies on some pre-trained deep model and
they may not generalize well. In this paper, we introduce a mask to separate
the image into low- and high-frequency parts based on image gradient magnitude,
and then devise a gradient sensitive loss to well capture the structures in the
image without sacrificing the recovery of low-frequency content. Moreover, by
investigating the duality in SR, we develop a dual reconstruction network (DRN)

choice of an appropriate epoch over which the empirical cross-correlation
return matrix is computed. A long epoch would smoothen the fluctuations in the
return time series and suffers from non-stationarity, whereas a short epoch
results in noisy fluctuations in the return time series and the correlation
matrices turn out to be highly singular. An effective method to tackle this
issue is the use of the power mapping, where a non-linear distortion is applied
to a short epoch correlation matrix. The value of distortion parameter controls
the noise-suppression. The distortion also removes the degeneracy of zero
eigenvalues. Depending on the correlation structures, interesting properties of
the eigenvalue spectra are found. We simulate different correlated Wishart
matrices to compare the results with empirical return matrices computed using

  We study the plasmon mass scale in three- and two-dimensional systems by
comparing three different methods to measure the mass scale. The methods are a
formula which can be derived from Hard Thermal Loop effective theory at leading
order (HTL), the effective dispersion relation (DR) and measurement of the
plasma oscillation frequency triggered by the introduction of a uniform
electric field (UE) into the system. We observe that in both systems the
plasmon mass scale decreases like a power law after an occupation number
dependent initial transient time. In both cases the UE and HTL methods are in
rough agreement, and in the three-dimensional case the two agree in the
continuum limit.
  As a second way to study the quasiparticle properties, we derive, implement
and test an algorithm which can be used to simulate linearized fluctuations on
top of the classical background. The algorithm is derived by requiring
conservation of Gauss' law and gauge invariance. We then apply the algorithm to
spectral properties of overoccupied gluodynamics using linear response theory.
We establish the existence of transverse and longitudinal quasiparticles by
extracting their spectral functions. We also extract the dispersion relation,
effective mass, plasmon mass and damping rate of the quasiparticles. Our
results are consistent with the HTL effective theory, but we also observe
effects beyond leading order HTL.

  and web application",,,"10.1093/ije/dyy275",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical epidemiology has focused on the control of confounding but it is
only recently that epidemiologists have started to focus on the bias produced
by colliders. A collider for a certain pair of variables (e.g., an outcome Y
and an exposure A) is a third variable (C) that is caused by both. In a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), a collider is the variable in the middle of an
inverted fork (i.e., the variable C in A -> C <- Y). Controlling for, or
conditioning an analysis on a collider (i.e., through stratification or
regression) can introduce a spurious association between its causes. This
potentially explains many paradoxical findings in the medical literature, where
established risk factors for a particular outcome appear protective. We use an
example from non-communicable disease epidemiology to contextualize and explain
the effect of conditioning on a collider. We generate a dataset with 1,000
observations and run Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the effect of 24-hour
dietary sodium intake on systolic blood pressure, controlling for age, which
acts as a confounder, and 24-hour urinary protein excretion, which acts as a
collider. We illustrate how adding a collider to a regression model introduces
bias. Thus, to prevent paradoxical associations, epidemiologists estimating
causal effects should be wary of conditioning on colliders. We provide R-code
in easy-to-read boxes throughout the manuscript and a GitHub repository
(https://github.com/migariane/ColliderApp) for the reader to reproduce our
example. We also provide an educational web application allowing real-time
interaction to visualize the paradoxical effect of conditioning on a collider

contribution due to interactions between scalar and tensor fluctuations leaves
a specific signature in the four-point function of curvature perturbations,
thus on clustering properties of collapsed structures. We compute the
contribution of graviton exchange on two- and three-point function of halos,
showing that at large scales $k\sim 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ its magnitude

compared to those from quieter markets. During times of financial crisis, it
has been observed that traditional dependency in global markets breaks down.
However, such an upheaval in dependency structure happens over a span of
several months, with the breakdown coinciding with a major bankruptcy or
sovereign default. Even though risk managers generally agree that identifying
these periods of breakdown is important, there are few statistical methods to
test for significant breakdowns. The purpose of this paper is to propose a
simple test to detect such structural changes in global markets. This test
relies on the assumption that asset price follows a Geometric Brownian Motion.
We test for a breakdown in correlation structure using eigenvalue
decomposition. We derive the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis
and apply the test to stock returns. We compute the power of our test and
compare it with the power of other known tests. Our test is able to accurately
identify the times of structural breakdown in real-world stock returns. Overall
we argue, despite the parsimony and simplicity in the assumption of Geometric
Brownian Motion, our test can perform well to identify the breakdown in
dependency of global markets.

model of concurrency with extensive applications in modelling and analysis of
hardware, software and database systems, as well as chemical, biological and
business processes. The central algorithmic problem for Petri nets is
reachability: whether from the given initial configuration there exists a
sequence of valid execution steps that reaches the given final configuration.
The complexity of the problem has remained unsettled since the 1960s, and it is
one of the most prominent open questions in the theory of verification.
Decidability was proved by Mayr in his seminal STOC 1981 work, and the
currently best published upper bound is non-primitive recursive Ackermannian of
Leroux and Schmitz from LICS 2019. We establish a non-elementary lower bound,
i.e. that the reachability problem needs a tower of exponentials of time and
space. Until this work, the best lower bound has been exponential space, due to
Lipton in 1976. The new lower bound is a major breakthrough for several
reasons. Firstly, it shows that the reachability problem is much harder than
the coverability (i.e., state reachability) problem, which is also ubiquitous
but has been known to be complete for exponential space since the late 1970s.
Secondly, it implies that a plethora of problems from formal languages, logic,
concurrent systems, process calculi and other areas, that are known to admit
reductions from the Petri nets reachability problem, are also not elementary.
Thirdly, it makes obsolete the currently best lower bounds for the reachability
problems for two key extensions of Petri nets: with branching and with a
pushdown stack.

networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which takes the
rescaling-invariant property of ReLU into account. It has been shown that the
generalization error bound in terms of the path norm explains the empirical
generalization behaviors of the ReLU neural networks better than that of other
capacity measures. Moreover, optimization algorithms which take path norm as
the regularization term to the loss function, like Path-SGD, have been shown to
achieve better generalization performance. However, the path norm counts the
values of all paths, and hence the capacity measure based on path norm could be
improperly influenced by the dependency among different paths. It is also known
that each path of a ReLU network can be represented by a small group of
linearly independent basis paths with multiplication and division operation,
which indicates that the generalization behavior of the network only depends on
only a few basis paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new norm
\emph{Basis-path Norm} based on a group of linearly independent paths to
measure the capacity of neural networks more accurately. We establish a
generalization error bound based on this basis path norm, and show it explains
the generalization behaviors of ReLU networks more accurately than previous
capacity measures via extensive experiments. In addition, we develop
optimization algorithms which minimize the empirical risk regularized by the
basis-path norm. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed regularization method achieves clearly better performance on the test

influence of UV irradiation on the charge trapping capability of PET in samples
exposed for different periods of time, up to 10 weeks. The pulsed
electro-acoustic technique (PEA) has been used to determine the charge profile.
The injected charge that the material is able to retain on the irradiated

traps. An extensive characterization of these localized states has been
performed by thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) technique.
Parameters of charge relaxation kinetics have been obtained fitting spectra of
the $\rho_c$ peak, related to injected charge, to the general order kinetics
model. A relaxation map analysis shows that relaxation times become more
distributed and the activation energy decreases as irradiation time is
increased. The activation energy decreases approximately by 10% after 10 weeks
of exposition. These results show that UV irradiation creates additional traps
on the treated surface, which agrees with PEA results, and that these traps are
shallower and their energy depth distribution is wider than in the case of

[Phys. Rev. E. 97, 053301 (2018)] to simulate ring-down measurements in two
setups where domain wall dynamics is induced by mechanical motion. These
include a single thin film with a domain wall in an external field and a setup
mimicking a magnetic cantilever tip and substrate, in which the two magnets
interact through dipolar interactions. We investigate how various micromagnetic
parameters influence the domain wall dynamics actuated by the oscillatory
spring-driven mechanical motion and the resulting damping coefficient. Our
simulations show that the magnitude of magnetic friction can be comparable to
other forms of non-contact friction. For oscillation frequencies lower than
those inducing excitations of the internal structure of the domain walls, the
damping coefficient is found to be independent of frequency. Hence, our results
obtained in the frequency range from 8 to 112 MHz are expected to be relevant
also for typical experimental setups operating in the 100 kHz range.

them in naturally occurring phenomena. We also present numerical experiments

that takes initial weights and attack and support relations into account. Until
recently, convergence of these iterative procedures was not very well
understood in cyclic graphs. Mossakowski and Neuhaus recently introduced a
unification of different approaches and proved first convergence and divergence
results. We build up on this work, simplify and generalize convergence results
and complement them with runtime guarantees. As it turns out, there is a
tradeoff between semantics' convergence guarantees and their ability to move
strength values away from the initial weights. We demonstrate that divergence
problems can be avoided without this tradeoff by continuizing semantics.
Semantically, we extend the framework with a Duality property that assures a
symmetric impact of attack and support relations. We also present a Java

dynamic equation for the polar order parameter with a modified Stokes equation
for the solvent flow. Here, we extend the model by including an external field
that exerts an aligning torque on the swimmers (mimicking the situation in
chemo-, photo-, magneto- or gravitaxis). Compared to the field-free case, the
external field breaks the rotational symmetry of the vortex dynamics and leads
instead to strongly asymmetric, traveling stripe patterns, as demonstrated by
numerical solution and linear stability analysis. We further analyze the
emerging structures using a reduced model which involves only an (effective)
microswimmer velocity field. This model is significantly easier to handle
analytically, but still preserves the main features of the asymmetric pattern
formation. We observe an underlying transition between a square vortex lattice
and a traveling stripe pattern. These structures can be well described in the
framework of weakly nonlinear analysis, provided the strength of nonlinear
advection is sufficiently weak.

as several issues connected to the errors propagation, with use of synthetic
data. After that, we test the method with real Union2.1 and JLA, as well as
recent PANTHEON SNe Ia datasets. It worths mentioning that in our approach we
assume no {\it Ans\""atzen} on the dynamical variables (e.g., $H(z)$), which
makes our method free of any degeneracies and biases which arise if one assume
one or another way to parameterize $H(z)$, or the equation of state, or some
other variable. On the other hand, the price we pay for this freedom is immense
-- although the scheme demonstrates perfect reconstruction in the case of
synthetic data, the reconstruction from the real data seems almost impossible,
at least on the current data precision level. The errors of the resulting
potential and of the kinetic term are huge; for the Hubble parameter they are
smaller but still severalfold larger than those obtained with parameterization.
Finally, we test the method with non-SNe $H(z)$ datasets, and the results are
also disappointing -- similar to the SNe case, the reconstruction is not
possible as the reconstructed kinetic term enters the negative values. This
could be treated as a manifestation of the insufficient data precision, or as
the overestimation of $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ values -- we discuss both
possibilities.

approach to convert 2D semiconductors, which are amply abundant, to 2D
topological insulators (TIs), which are less available, via selective atomic
adsorption and strain engineering. The approach is underlined by an orbital
design principle that involves introducing an extrinsic s-orbital state into
the intrinsic sp-bands of a 2D semiconductor, so as to induce s-p band
inversion for a TI phase, as demonstrated by tight-binding model analyses.
Remarkably, based on first-principles calculations, we apply this approach to
convert the semiconducting monolayer CuS and CuTe into a TI by adsorbing Na and
K respectively with a proper s-level energy, and CuSe into a TI by adsorbing a
mixture of Na and K with a tuned s-level energy or by adsorbing either Na or K
on a strained CuSe with a tuned p-level valence band edge. Our findings open a
new door to the discovery of TIs by a predictive materials design, beyond
finding a preexisting 2D TI.

inside a structure called the nucleoid is a longstanding but still lively
debated question. Most puzzling is the fact that the nucleoid occupies only a
small fraction of the cell, although it is not separated from the rest of the
cytoplasm by any membrane and would occupy a volume about thousand times larger
outside from the cell. Here, by performing numerical simulations with
coarse-grained models, we elaborate on the conjecture that the formation of the
nucleoid may result from a segregative phase separation mechanism driven by the
demixing of the DNA coil and non-binding globular macromolecules present in the
cytoplasm, presumably functional ribosomes. Simulations performed with crowders
having spherical, dumbbell or octahedral geometry highlight the sensitive
dependence of the level of DNA compaction on the dissymmetry of DNA/DNA,
DNA/crowder, and crowder/crowder repulsive interactions, thereby supporting the
segregative phase separation scenario. Simulations also consistently predict
much stronger DNA compaction close to the jamming threshold. Moreover,
simulations performed with crowders of different sizes suggest that the final
density distribution of each species results from the competition between
thermodynamic forces and steric hindrance, so that bigger crowders are expelled
selectively from the nucleoid only at moderate total crowder concentrations.
This work leads to several predictions, which may eventually be tested
experimentally.

double white dwarfs for producing SNIa. We analyse whether this lack of
detections is due to observational effects. To that end we simulate the double

the SNIa progenitors. We demonstrate that their identification, based on the
detection of Halpha double-lined profiles arising from the two white dwarfs in
the synthetic spectra, is extremely challenging due to their intrinsic
faintness. This translates into an observational probability of finding double
white dwarf SNIa progenitors in the Galaxy of (2.1+-1.0)x10^{-5} and
(0.8+-0.4)x10^{-5} for the classical Chandrasekhar and the sub-Chandrasekhar

progenitors are found to suffer from the same observational effect. The next
generation of large-aperture telescopes are expected to help in increasing the

  Winnipeg, 2018",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a set of $n$ disks of radius $R$ in the Euclidean plane, the Traveling
Salesman Problem With Neighborhoods (TSPN) on uniform disks asks for the
shortest tour that visits all of the disks. The problem is a generalization of
the classical Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) on points and has been widely
studied in the literature. For the case of disjoint uniform disks of radius
$R$, Dumitrescu and Mitchell[2001] show that the optimal TSP tour on the
centers of the disks is a $3.547$-approximation to the TSPN version. The core
of their analysis is based on bounding the detour that the optimal TSPN tour
has to make in order to visit the centers of each disk and shows that it is at
most $2Rn$ in the worst case. H\""{a}me, Hyyti\""{a} and Hakula[2011] asked
whether this bound is tight when $R$ is small and conjectured that it is at
most $\sqrt{3}Rn$.
  We further investigate this question and derive structural properties of the
optimal TSPN tour to describe the cases in which the bound is smaller than
$2Rn$. Specifically, we show that if the optimal TSPN tour is not a straight
line, at least one of the following is guaranteed to be true: the bound is
smaller than $1.999Rn$ or the $TSP$ on the centers is a $2$-approximation. The
latter bound of $2$ is the best that we can get in general. Our framework is
based on using the optimality of the TSPN tour to identify local structures for
which the detour is large and then using their geometry to derive better lower
bounds on the length of the TSPN tour. This leads to an improved approximation
factor of $3.53$ for disjoint uniform disks and $6.728$ for the general case.
We further show that the H\""{a}me, Hyyti\""{a} and Hakula conjecture is true for
the case of three disks and discuss the method used to obtain it. Along the
way, we will uncover one way in which the TSPN problem is structurally
different from the classical TSP.

Beam energy measurements required the variation of the relative undulator
distance in the decimeter range and the analysis of the intensity oscillation
length in the interference spectrum. A statistical precision of 1 keV was
achieved in 1 hour of data taking, while systematic uncertainties of 700 keV
were present in the experiment. These developments aim for a relative precision

new XMM-Newton observations occurred during a pronounced dip in the X-ray
lightcurve. The broad-band X-ray spectrum is highly absorbed, attenuated by a
soft X-ray absorber of column density $N_{\rm H}=6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. An
increase in obscuration occurs during the dip, which may be due to an X-ray
eclipse. In addition, the persistent, fast Fe K outflow is present, with
velocity components of $-0.25c$ and $-0.4c$. The soft absorber is less ionized
($\log\xi=3$) compared to the iron K outflow ($\log\xi=5$) and is outflowing
with a velocity of approximately $-0.2c$. A soft X-ray excess is present below
1 keV against the highly absorbed continuum and can be attributed to the
re-emission from a wide angle wind. The complex X-ray absorption present in PDS
456 suggests that the wind is inhomogeneous, whereby the soft X-ray absorber
originates from denser clumps or filaments which may form further out along the
outflow. In contrast to the X-ray observations, the simultaneous UV spectrum of
PDS 456 is largely unabsorbed, where only a very weak broad absorption trough
is present bluewards of Ly$\alpha$, compared to a past observation in 2000 when
the trough was significantly stronger. The relative weakness of the UV
absorption may be due to the soft X-ray absorber being too highly ionized and
almost transparent in the UV band.

change over time due to the variety of interactions within a computer system.
To show Chalktalk's capabilities, we have prototyped sketch implementations for

as a function of the size of the spherical box. At low compactness values, low
energies and for sufficiently big systems the system is subject to a
gravothermal catastrophe, which cannot be halted by quantum degeneracy
pressure, and the system collapses towards the formation of a black hole. For
small systems, there appears no instability at low energies. For intermediate
sizes, between two marginal values, gravothermal catastrophe is halted and a
microcanonical phase transition occurs from a gaseous phase to a condensed
phase with a nearly degenerate core. The system is subject to a relativistic
instability at low energy, when the core gets sufficiently condensed above the
Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit. For sufficiently high values of rest mass
compactness the microcanonical phase transitions are suppressed. They are
replaced either by an Antonov type gravothermal catastrophe for sufficiently
big systems or by stable equilibria for small systems. At high energies the

efficient algorithm in order to cancel saturation while reconstructing

on sinc-related bases. It involves matrix inversion and is a direct,
non-iterative approach. It consists of two main steps: (i) regression, to
estimate the expansion coefficients of the signal model; (ii) interpolation, to
restore an estimated value for those samples that are saturated. Because the
proposed method is free from tuning parameters, it is hardware-friendly and we
expect that it will be particularly useful in the context of orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing. There, the high peak-to-average power ratio of
the transmitted signal results in a challenging decoding stage in the presence
of saturation, which causes significant decoding errors due to the nonlinearity
of amplifiers and receivers, ultimately resulting in band distortion and
information loss. Our experiments on realistic simulations confirm that our
proposed reconstruction of the saturated samples can significantly reduce

extra dimensions. We employ the geometrical coupling mechanism and find an
analytical solution for the $U(1)$ gauge field valid for any warp factor. Using
this solution we find that the only condition necessary for localization is
that the bulk geometry is asymptotically AdS. Therefore, our solution has an
universal validity for any warp factor and is independent of the particular
model considered. We also show that the model has no tachyonic modes. Finally,
we study the scalar components of the $D$-vector field. As a general result, we
show that if we consider the coupling with the tensor and the Ricci scalar in
higher co-dimensions, there is an indication that both sectors will be
localized. As a concrete example, the above techniques are applied for the
intersecting brane model. We obtain that the branes introduce boundary
conditions that fix all parameters of the model in such a way that both

ultra-light boson clouds can be a source of persistent gravitational waves,
potentially detectable by current and future gravitational-wave detectors.
These signals have been predicted to be nearly monochromatic, with a small
steady frequency increase (spin-up), but given the several assumptions and
simplifications done at theoretical level, it is wise to consider, from the
data analysis point of view, a broader class of gravitational signals in which
the phase (or the frequency) slightly wander in time. Also other types of
sources, e.g. neutron stars in which a torque balance equilibrium exists
between matter accretion and emission of persistent gravitational waves, would
fit in this category. In this paper we present a robust and computationally
cheap analysis pipeline devoted to the search of such kind of signals. We
provide a full characterization of the method, through both a theoretical
sensitivity estimation and through the analysis of syntethic data in which
simulated signals have been injected. The search setup for both all-sky

constraints from Planck CMB experiment as well as the JLA supernovae
compilation. Considering a $w$CDM cosmological model measured on scales up to
$k_{max} = 0.07h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, we constrain a constant dark energy
equation-of-state with a $\sim 4\%$ error at the 1-$\sigma$ level: $w_0 =
-0.993^{+0.046}_{-0.043}$, together with $\Omega_m = 0.330\pm 0.012$, $\Omega_b
= 0.0505 \pm 0.002$, $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3} = 0.863 \pm
0.016$, and $h = 0.661 \pm 0.012$. For the same combination of datasets, but
now considering a $\Lambda$CDM model with massive neutrinos and the same scale
cut, we find: $\Omega_m = 0.328 \pm 0.009$, $\Omega_b =
0.05017^{+0.0009}_{-0.0008}$, $S_8 = 0.862 \pm 0.017$, and $h =
0.663^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ and a 95\% credible interval (CI) upper limit of $\sum
m_{\nu} < 0.14$ eV for a normal hierarchy. These results are competitive if not
better than standard analyses with the same dataset, and demonstrate this

requiring trivial holonomy around the contractible cycle the asymptotic
symmetries are broken to some subsets of exact isometries. Different coadjoint
orbits of the asymptotic symmetry group yield different types of boundary
dynamics; we find that the action principle can be reduced to either the
extended super-Schwarzian theory, consistent with the dynamics of a
non-vanishing Casimir function, or to superparticle models, compatible with
bulk configurations whose Casimir is zero. These results are generalized to
$\mathcal{N} \geq 3$ by making use of boundary conditions consistent with the

assembly history of JD1, or any other galaxy at these redshifts that exhibits a

results from a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the region

we show that dust preferentially resides in the vicinity of the young stars

simulated SEDs are consistent with the photometry of JD1 and two other $z>9$
systems (GN-z10-3 and GN-z9-1) that have proposed Balmer breaks at high

galaxies with nearly identical stellar and halo masses, indicating the
importance of morphology, assembly history, and dust distribution in making
inferences on the properties of individual galaxies at high redshifts. Our
results stress the importance that dust may play in modulating the observable

low-dimensional feature space. A feedback control law is then sought for each
cluster state through iterative evaluation and downhill simplex search to
minimize power consumption in flight. Unsupervised clustering of the flow
trajectories for in-situ learning and optimization of coarse-grained control
laws are implemented in an automated manner as key enablers. Re-routing the
flow trajectories, the optimized control laws shift the cluster populations to
the aerodynamically favorable states. Utilizing limited number of sensor

determined in only $O(10)$ iterations. The objective of the present work is not
necessarily to suppress flow separation but to minimize the desired cost
function to achieve enhanced aerodynamic performance. The present control

unbounded sparse outliers are common in many signal processing applications.
Sparse recovery inspired robust regression (SRIRR) techniques are shown to
deliver high quality estimation performance in such regression models.
Unfortunately, most SRIRR techniques assume \textit{a priori} knowledge of
noise statistics like inlier noise variance or outlier statistics like number
of outliers. Both inlier and outlier noise statistics are rarely known
\textit{a priori} and this limits the efficient operation of many SRIRR
algorithms. This article proposes a novel noise statistics oblivious algorithm
called residual ratio thresholding GARD (RRT-GARD) for robust regression in the
presence of sparse outliers. RRT-GARD is developed by modifying the recently
proposed noise statistics dependent greedy algorithm for robust de-noising
(GARD). Both finite sample and asymptotic analytical results indicate that
RRT-GARD performs nearly similar to GARD with \textit{a priori} knowledge of
noise statistics. Numerical simulations in real and synthetic data sets also
point to the highly competitive performance of RRT-GARD.

such, cell-edge users receive more power in NOMA and due to this biased power
allocation toward cell-edge users inter-cell interference is more severe in
NOMA compared to OMA. NOMA also compromises security for spectral
efficiency.}''$ The above statements are actually false, and this paper aims at
identifying such common myths about NOMA and clarifying why they are not true.

of economic game theory, artificial intelligence and statistical physics by
developing an analytical understanding of the learning dynamics (often in
relation to the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory). However, the
majority of these analytical studies focuses on repeated normal form games,
which only have a single environmental state. Environmental dynamics, i.e.,
changes in the state of an environment affecting the agents' payoffs has
received less attention, lacking a universal method to obtain deterministic
equations from established multistate reinforcement learning algorithms.
  In this work we present a novel methodological extension, separating the
interaction from the adaptation time scale, to derive the deterministic limit
of a general class of reinforcement learning algorithms, called temporal
difference learning. This form of learning is equipped to function in more
realistic multistate environments by using the estimated value of future
environmental states to adapt the agent's behavior. We demonstrate the
potential of our method with the three well established learning algorithms Q
learning, SARSA learning and Actor-Critic learning. Illustrations of their
dynamics on two multiagent, multistate environments reveal a wide range of
different dynamical regimes, such as convergence to fixed points, limit cycles,
and even deterministic chaos.

use the Coulomb gas formalism to explicitly calculate the OTOC across the full
time regime. In contrast to large-$N$ chaotic systems, these models do not
display a separation of time scales, due to the lack of a large parameter. We
find that the physics at early times ($0<t-x\ll\beta$) and late times
($t-x\gg\beta$) are controlled by different OPE channels, which are related to
each other via the braiding matrix. The normalized OTOC obeys a power-law decay
with a fractional power at early times and approaches a generically nonzero
value in an exponential way at late times. The late time value is related to
the modular $S$-matrix and is in agreement with earlier calculations. All of
the results above are readily generalized to rational conformal field theories.

waves off finite periodic media made of elastic and viscoelastic layers. It
further considers whether a Willis-type constitutive matrix (in temporal and
spatial Fourier domain) may reproduce the scattering matrix (SM) of such a
system. In answering this question the procedure to determine the relevant
overall constitutive parameters for such a medium is presented. To do this,
first the general form of the dispersion relation and impedances for oblique SH
propagation in such coupled Willis-type media are developed. The band structure
and scattering of layered media are calculated using the transfer matrix (TM)
method. The dispersion relation may be derived based on the eigensolutions of
an infinite periodic domain. The wave impedances associated with the exterior
surfaces of a finite thickness slab are extracted from the scattering of such a
system. Based on reciprocity and available symmetries of the structure and each
constituent layer, the general form of the dispersion and impedances may be
simplified. The overall quantities may be extracted by equating the scattering
data from TM with those expected from a Willis-type medium. It becomes evident
that a Willis-type coupled constitutive tensor with components that are assumed
independent of wave vector is unable to reproduce all oblique scattering data.
Therefore, non-unique wave vector dependent formulations are introduced, whose
SM matches that of the layered media exactly. It is further shown that the
dependence of the overall constitutive tensors of such systems on the wave
vector is not removable even at very small frequencies and incidence angles and
that analytical considerations significantly limit the potential forms of the
spatially dispersive constitutive tensors.

essential task for future on-orbit servicing and close-proximity formation
flying missions. However, two issues hinder reliable on-board monocular vision
based pose estimation: robustness to illumination conditions due to a lack of
reliable visual features and scarcity of image datasets required for training
and benchmarking. To address these two issues, this work details the design and
validation of a monocular vision based pose determination architecture for
spaceborne applications. The primary contribution to the state-of-the-art of
this work is the introduction of a novel pose determination method based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to provide an initial guess of the pose in
real-time on-board. The method involves discretizing the pose space and
training the CNN with images corresponding to the resulting pose labels. Since
reliable training of the CNN requires massive image datasets and computational
resources, the parameters of the CNN must be determined prior to the mission
with synthetic imagery. Moreover, reliable training of the CNN requires
datasets that appropriately account for noise, color, and illumination
characteristics expected in orbit. Therefore, the secondary contribution of
this work is the introduction of an image synthesis pipeline, which is tailored
to generate high fidelity images of any spacecraft 3D model. The proposed
technique is scalable to spacecraft of different structural and physical
properties as well as robust to the dynamic illumination conditions of space.
Through metrics measuring classification and pose accuracy, it is shown that
the presented architecture has desirable robustness and scalable properties.

the classic approach the mean-field Smoluchowski coagulation is used. However,
the assumptions of the mean-field theory are rarely met in real systems which
limits the accuracy of the solution. In our approach, cluster sizes and time
are discrete, and the binary aggregation alone governs the time evolution of
the systems. By considering the growth histories of all possible clusters and
applying monodisperse initial conditions, the exact expression for the
probability of finding a coagulating system with an arbitrary kernel in a given
cluster configuration is derived. Then, the average number of such clusters and
the standard deviation of these solutions can be calculated. In this work,
recursive equations for all possible growth histories of clusters are
introduced. The correctness of our expressions was proved based on the
comparison with numerical results obtained for systems with constant,
multiplicative and additive kernels. For the first time the exact solutions for
the multiplicative and additive kernels were obtained with this framework. In
addition, our results were compared with the results arising from the solutions
to the mean-field Smoluchowski equation. Our theoretical predictions outperform

proposed to minimize operational costs while controlling the risk arising from
uncertainties like renewable generation and load consumption. To solve CC-OPF,
we often need access to the (true) joint probability distribution of all
uncertainties, which is rarely known in practice. A solution based on a biased
estimate of the distribution can result in poor reliability. To overcome this
challenge, recent work has explored distributionally robust chance constraints,
in which the chance constraints are satisfied over a family of distributions
called the ambiguity set. Commonly, ambiguity sets are only based on moment
information (e.g., mean and covariance) of the random variables; however,
specifying additional characteristics of the random variables reduces
conservatism and cost. Here, we consider ambiguity sets that additionally
incorporate unimodality information. In practice, it is difficult to estimate
the mode location from the data and so we allow it to be potentially
misspecified. We formulate the problem and derive a separation-based algorithm
to efficiently solve it. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
approach on a modified IEEE-30 bus network with wind uncertainty and compare
with other distributionally robust approaches. We find that a misspecified mode
significantly affects the reliability of the solution and the proposed model
demonstrates a good trade-off between cost and reliability.

haloes from Illustris, a suite of hydrodynamical (Illustris) and DM-only
(Illustris-Dark) cosmological simulations performed with the moving-mesh code
{\sc arepo}. DM halo shapes are determined using an iterative method based on
the inertia tensor for a wide range of $z=0$ masses ($M_{200} = 1 \times
10^{11} - 3 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$). Convergence tests shows that the local DM
shape profiles are converged only for $r > 9\epsilon$, $\epsilon$ being the
Plummer-equivalent softening length, larger than expected. Haloes from
non-radiative simulations (i.e. neglecting radiative processes, star formation,
and feedback) exhibit no alteration in shapes from their DM-only counterparts:
thus moving-mesh hydrodynamics alone is insufficient to cause differences in DM
shapes. With the full galaxy-physics implementation, condensation of baryons
results in significantly rounder and more oblate haloes, with the median
minor-to-major axis ratio $\left< s\equiv c/a \right> \approx 0.7$, almost
invariant throughout the halo and across halo masses. This somewhat improves
the agreement between simulation predictions and observational estimates of the
Milky Way halo shape. Consistently, the velocity anisotropy of DM is also
reduced in Illustris, across halo masses and radii. Within the inner halo
($r=0.15 R_{200}$), both $s$ and $q$ (intermediate-to-major axis ratio) exhibit
non-monotonicity with galaxy mass, peaking at $m_* \approx 10^{10.5-11}
M_\odot$, which we find is due to the strong dependence of inner halo shape
with galaxy formation efficiency. Baryons in Illustris affect the correlation
of halo shape with halo properties, leading to a positive correlation of
sphericity of MW-mass haloes with halo formation time and concentration, the
latter being mildly more pronounced than in Illustris-Dark.

circular path with the same semimajor axis $a$ of LAGEOS, in orbit since 1976,
and an inclination $I$ of its orbital plane supplementary with respect to that
of its existing cousin. According to their proponents, the sum of the
satellites' precessions of the longitudes of the ascending nodes $\Omega$
should allow one to test the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect to a
$\simeq 0.2\%$ accuracy level, with a contribution of the mismodeling in the
even zonal harmonics $J_\ell,~\ell=2,4,6,\ldots$ of the geopotential to the
total error budget as little as $0.1\%$. Actually, such an ambitious goal seems
to be hardly attainable because of the direct and indirect impact of, at least,
the first even zonal $J_2$. On the one hand, the lingering scatter of the
estimated values of such a key geophysical parameter from different recent
GRACE/GOCE-based global gravity field solutions is representative of an
uncertainty which may directly impact the summed Lense-Thirring node
precessions at a $\simeq 70-80\%$ in the worst scenarios, and to a $\simeq
3-10\%$ level in other, more favorable cases. On the other hand, the
phenomenologically measured secular decay $\dot a$ of the semimajor axis of
LAGEOS (and, presumably, of the other satellite as well), currently known at a
$\sigma_{\dot a}\simeq 0.03~\textrm{m~yr}^{-1}$ level after more than 30 yr,
will couple with the sum of the $J_2$-induced node precessions yielding an
overall bias as large as $\simeq 20-40\%$ after $5-10$ yr. A further systematic
error of the order of $\simeq 2-14\%$ may arise from an analogous interplay of
the secular decay of the inclination $\dot I$ with the oblateness-driven node
precessions.

applications. Previous MPC implementations have considered instantaneous
constraints on engine-out emissions in order to meet legislated emissions

and hence, can be satisfied on average rather than just instantaneously,
potentially allowing the controller to exploit the trade-off between emissions
and fuel economy. In this work, an MPC is formulated to maximise the fuel
efficiency whilst tracking boost pressure and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)
rate references, and in the face of uncertainties, adhering to the input,
safety constraints and constraints on emissions averaged over some finite time
period. The tracking performance and satisfaction of average emissions
constraints using the proposed controller are demonstrated through an
experimental study considering the new European drive cycle.

system, which can be divided into two phases: (1) sentence planning: deciding
the overall sentence structure, (2) surface realization: determining specific
word forms and flattening the sentence structure into a string. With the rise
of deep learning, most modern NLG models are based on a sequence-to-sequence
(seq2seq) model, which basically contains an encoder-decoder structure; these
NLG models generate sentences from scratch by jointly optimizing sentence
planning and surface realization. However, such simple encoder-decoder
architecture usually fail to generate complex and long sentences, because the
decoder has difficulty learning all grammar and diction knowledge well. This
paper introduces an NLG model with a hierarchical attentional decoder, where
the hierarchy focuses on leveraging linguistic knowledge in a specific order.
The experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
traditional seq2seq model with a smaller model size, and the design of the
hierarchical attentional decoder can be applied to various NLG systems.
Furthermore, different generation strategies based on linguistic patterns are
investigated and analyzed in order to guide future NLG research work.

states responsible for the small-signal stability of power networks. To this
end, the newly developed notion of information transfer between the states of a
dynamical system is used. In particular, using the concept of information
transfer, which characterizes influence between the various states and a linear
combination of states of a dynamical system, we identify the generators and
states which are responsible for causing instability of the power network.
While characterizing influence from state to state, information transfer can
also describe influence from state to modes thereby generalizing the well-known
notion of participation factor while at the same time overcoming some of the
limitations of the participation factor. The developed framework is applied to
study the three bus system identifying various cause of instabilities in the
system. The simulation study is extended to IEEE 39 bus system.

continues to overwhelm the processing capability of existing algorithms and
compute infrastructures. In this work, we explore the use of hardware/software
co-design and hardware acceleration to significantly reduce the execution time
of short sequence alignment, a crucial step in analyzing sequenced genomes. We
introduce Shouji, a highly-parallel and accurate pre-alignment filter that
remarkably reduces the need for computationally-costly dynamic programming
algorithms. The first key idea of our proposed pre-alignment filter is to
provide high filtering accuracy by correctly detecting all common subsequences
shared between two given sequences. The second key idea is to design a hardware
accelerator that adopts modern FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
architectures to further boost the performance of our algorithm.
  Results: Shouji significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment
filtering by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art
pre-alignment filters, GateKeeper and SHD. Our FPGA-based accelerator is up to
three orders of magnitude faster than the equivalent CPU implementation of
Shouji. Using a single FPGA chip, we benchmark the benefits of integrating
Shouji with five state-of-the-art sequence aligners, designed for different
computing platforms. The addition of Shouji as a pre-alignment step reduces the
execution time of the five state-of-the-art sequence aligners by up to 18.8x.
Shouji can be adapted for any bioinformatics pipeline that performs sequence
alignment for verification. Unlike most existing methods that aim to accelerate
sequence alignment, Shouji does not sacrifice any of the aligner capabilities,
as it does not modify or replace the alignment step.

are constructed in parallel, which improves the training efficiency. Meanwhile,
any two inputs at different times are connected directly by self-attention
mechanism, which solves the long range dependency problem effectively. Using
phoneme sequences as input, our Transformer TTS network generates mel
spectrograms, followed by a WaveNet vocoder to output the final audio results.
Experiments are conducted to test the efficiency and performance of our new
network. For the efficiency, our Transformer TTS network can speed up the
training about 4.25 times faster compared with Tacotron2. For the performance,
rigorous human tests show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art
performance (outperforms Tacotron2 with a gap of 0.048) and is very close to
human quality (4.39 vs 4.44 in MOS).

household appliance activities and provide related information to house owner
or/and utility company via a single sensor installed at the electrical entry of
the house. It can be used for different purposes in residential and industrial
sectors. Thus, an increasing number of new algorithms have been developed in
recent years. In these algorithms, researchers either use existing public
datasets or collect their own data which causes such problems as insufficiency
of electrical parameters, missing of ground-truth data, absence of many
appliances, and lack of appliance information. To solve these problems, this
paper presents a model-based platform for NILM system development, namely
Functional Intrusive Load Monitor (FILM). By using this platform, the state
transitions and activities of all the involved appliances can be preset by
researchers, and multiple electrical parameters such as harmonics and power
factor can be monitored or calculated. This platform will help researchers save
the time of collecting experimental data, utilize precise control of individual
appliance activities, and develop load signatures of devices. This paper
describes the steps, structure, and requirements of building this platform.
Case study is presented to help understand this platform.

see that the approximate operators give remarkably close results for transverse
even modes, while for odd transverse modes we have some discrepancies near the

first two longitudinal modes and better agreement for higher modes. The ad-hoc

to find the probability distribution of design variables of the shell and tube
heat exchanger. Thanks to this probability distribution, an uncertainty
analysis was also performed to find the quality of these variables. In
addition, a decision-making strategy based on confidence intervals of design

design variables which leads to marginally improved performance compared to
commonly used optimization methods. In order to verify the capability of the

cost reduction is feasible with respect to multi-objective and single-objective
optimization methods. Furthermore, the selected variables have good quality (in

show that the costs of the proposed design are lower than those obtained from
optimization method reported in previous studies. The algorithm was also used
to determine the impact of using probability values for the design variables

the topological quantum computers will be constructed. From other side the
string anyons are interesting topological phases of matter which can be
described using mathematical constructions such as Frobenius algebras and
open-closed string topological quantum field theories which are based on
cobordism categories. Recently was proposed that is possible to obtain
representations of cobordism categories using modular categories. In the
present work, the modular categories resulting as representations of the 3
dimensional bordism 2 category are used with the aim to construct a new model
of topological quantum computation. Such new model is named Sanyon Topological
Quantum Computation and it is is theoretically performed by evolving non
abelian string anyons (sanyons) using the Loop Braid Group and the open closed
cobordism category. The output of the computation uniquely depends on how the
sanyons have been braided by the Loop Braid Group and operated by the
generators of the cobordism category. Small disturbances do not unravel the
loop braids and the cobordisms, making the computation resistant to errors and
decoherence.

computing. In this paper, we develop 'DYVERSE: DYnamic VERtical Scaling in
Edge' environments, which is the first light-weight and dynamic vertical
scaling mechanism for managing resources allocated to applications for
facilitating multi-tenancy in Edge environments. To enable dynamic vertical
scaling, one static and three dynamic priority management approaches that are
workload-aware, community-aware and system-aware, respectively are proposed.
This research advocates that dynamic vertical scaling and priority management
approaches reduce Service Level Objective (SLO) violation rates. An online-game
and a face detection workload in a Cloud-Edge test-bed are used to validate the
research. The merits of DYVERSE is that there is only a sub-second overhead per
Edge server when 32 Edge servers are deployed on a single Edge node. When
compared to executing applications on the Edge servers without dynamic vertical
scaling, static priorities and dynamic priorities reduce SLO violation rates of
requests by up to 4% and 12% for the online game, respectively, and in both
cases 6% for the face detection workload. Moreover, for both workloads, the
system-aware dynamic vertical scaling method effectively reduces the latency of
non-violated requests, when compared to other methods.
