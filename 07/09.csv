finite abelian groups and develop a strong connection between the two problems.
We give a geometric condition under which a multiset of a finite abelian group
has the discrete Pompeiu property. Using this description and the revealed
connection we prove that Fuglede's conjecture holds for $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n q^2}$,
where $p$ and $q$ are different primes. In particular, we show that every
spectral subset of $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n q^2}$ tiles the group. Further, using our
combinatorial methods we give a simple proof for the statement that Fuglede's
conjecture holds for $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$.

(GL) candidates based on a search performed over the entire Gaia Data Release 2
(Gaia DR2). We also show that the sole astrometric and photometric informations
coming from the Gaia satellite yield sufficient insights for supervised
learning methods to automatically identify GL candidates with an efficiency
that is comparable to methods based on image processing. Methods: We simulated
106,623,188 lens systems composed of more than two images, based on a regular
grid of parameters characterizing a non-singular isothermal ellipsoid lens
model in the presence of an external shear. These simulations are used as an
input for training and testing our supervised learning models consisting of
Extremely Randomized Trees. The latter are finally used to assign to each of
the 2,129,659 clusters of celestial objects a discriminant value that reflects
the ability of our simulations to match the observed relative positions and
fluxes from each cluster. Once complemented with additional constraints, these
discriminant values allowed us to identify GL candidates out of the list of
clusters. Results: We report the discovery of 15 new quadruply-imaged lens
candidates with angular separations less than 6"" and assess the performance of
our approach by recovering 12 out of the 13 known quadruply-imaged systems with
all their components detected in Gaia DR2 with a misclassification rate of
fortuitous clusters of stars as lens systems that is below one percent.
Similarly, the identification capability of our method regarding
quadruply-imaged systems where three images are detected in Gaia DR2 is
assessed by recovering 10 out of the 13 known quadruply-imaged systems having
one of their constituting images discarded. The associated misclassification
rate varying then between 5.8% and 20%, depending on the image we decided to
remove.

inequalities that exclude certain classical hidden variable theories from
explaining quantum correlations. Another definition of non-locality refers to
the wave-function collapse thereby one can prepare a quantum state from
arbitrary far away. In both cases one can debate on whether non-locality is a
real physical phenomenon, e.g. one can employ formulations of quantum mechanics
that does not use collapse, or one can simply refrain from explaining quantum
correlations via classical hidden variables. Here we point out that there is a
non-local effect within quantum mechanics, i.e. without involving hidden
variables or collapse. This effect is seen via imprecise (i.e. interval-valued)
joint probability of two observables, which replaces the ill-defined notion of
the precise joint probability for non-commuting observables. It is consistent
with all requirements for the joint probability, e.g. those for commuting
observales. The non-locality amounts to a fact that (in a two-particle system)
the joint imprecise probability of non-commuting two-particle observables (i.e.
tensor product of single-particle observables) does not factorize into
single-particle contributions, even for uncorrelated states of the two-particle
system. The factorization is recovered for a less precise (i.e. the one
involving a wider interval) joint probability. This approach to non-locality
reconciles it with locality, since the latter emerges as a less precise

under which an attacker can destabilize the underlying network, as well as
another set of conditions under which local neighborhood tracking errors of
intact agents converge to zero. Based on this analysis, we propose a
Kullback-Liebler divergence based criterion in view of which each agent detects
its neighbors' misbehavior and, consequently, forms a self-belief about the
trustworthiness of the information it receives. Agents continuously update
their self-beliefs and communicate them with their neighbors to inform them of
the significance of their outgoing information. Moreover, if the self-belief of
an agent is low, it forms trust on its neighbors. Agents incorporate their
neighbors' self-beliefs and their own trust values on their control protocols
to slow down and mitigate attacks. We show that using the proposed resilient
approach, an agent discards the information it receives from a neighbor only if
its neighbor is compromised, and not solely based on the discrepancy among
neighbors' information, which might be caused by legitimate changes, and not
attacks. The proposed approach is guaranteed to work under mild connectivity

approximation (RWA), which is suitable only for drives whose amplitude, or
envelope, $H_1(t)$, is small compared to $\omega$ and varies slowly on the time
scale of $1/\omega$, yields a simple Hamiltonian that can be integrated
relatively easily. We present a series of corrections to the RWA Hamiltonian in
$1/\omega$, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian whose time evolution is
accurate also for time-dependent drive envelopes in the regime of strong
driving, i.e., for $|H_1(t)| \lesssim \omega$. By extending the Magnus
expansion with the use of a Taylor series we introduce a method that we call
the Magnus-Taylor expansion, which we use to derive a recurrence relation for
computing the effective Hamiltonian. We then employ the same method to derive
kick operators, which complete our theory for non-smooth drives. The time
evolution generated by our kick operators and effective Hamiltonian, both of

the need for an efficient source of sBHB formation. Active galactic nucleus
(AGN) disks are a promising location for the formation of these sBHBs, as well
as binaries of other compact objects, because of powerful torques exerted by
the gas disk. These gas torques cause orbiting compact objects to migrate
towards regions in the disk where inward and outward torques cancel, known as
migration traps. We simulate the migration of stellar mass black holes in an
example of a model AGN disk, using an augmented N-body code that includes
analytic approximations to migration torques, stochastic gravitational forces
exerted by turbulent density fluctuations in the disk, and inclination and
eccentricity dampening produced by passages through the gas disk, in addition
to the standard gravitational forces between objects. We find that sBHBs form
rapidly in our model disk as stellar-mass black holes migrate towards the
migration trap. These sBHBs are likely to subsequently merge on short
time-scales. The process continues, leading to the build-up of a population of
over-massive stellar-mass black holes. The formation of sBHBs in AGN disks
could contribute significantly to the sBHB merger rate inferred by LIGO.

access to Fourier samples of $y$, we derive an algorithm for this problem for
estimating the source parameters of each group, along with precise
non-asymptotic guarantees. Our approach involves estimating the group
parameters sequentially in the order of increasing scale parameters, i.e., from
group $1$ to $L$. In particular, the estimation process at stage $1 \leq l \leq
L$ involves (i) carefully sampling the tail of the Fourier transform of $y$,
(ii) a \emph{deflation} step wherein we subtract the contribution of the groups
processed thus far from the obtained Fourier samples, and (iii) applying
Moitra's modified Matrix Pencil method on a deconvolved version of the samples

use local and global sensitivity and correlation analysis to determine
parameters that can be inferred from the model and available data. Least
squares optimization is used to estimate mouse specific parameters, and
Bayesian as well as asymptotic uncertainty quantification techniques are
employed to determine confidence, credible, and prediction intervals for the
model parameters and response. These techniques are used to examine the effects
of network size and to understand how parameters change with disease
(hypertension). Results showed that the peripheral vascular resistance is the
most sensitive, and as the network size increases the parameter behavior
changes. Correlation analysis revealed that in hypertension large vessel
stiffness is correlated with proximal resistance in the boundary. We were able
to estimate identifiable parameters using both deterministic and Bayesian
techniques (the maxima of the parameter distributions determined using Bayesian
analysis aligned with local optima). From these estimates we determined
confidence and prediction intervals, which all were within physiological
expectation. Analysis of estimated parameter values for the representative mice
studied here showed that the hypertensive mouse has stiffer (but larger)
vessels and that compliance is decreased both in the proximal and peripheral
vasculature.

$\gamma$-ray flux above 100 MeV $(3.55\pm0.55)\times10^{-5}\:{\rm

the infrared thermal radiation of the dusty torus is considered. In the flaring
periods when the correlation between the $\gamma$-ray and UV/optical/X-ray

interaction of fresh electrons in a different blob, which does not make a

separable data clusters, with a linear or a perceptron type output layer making
the final projection on the line perpendicular to the discriminating
hyperplane. For complex data with multimodal distributions this transformation
is difficult to learn. Projection on $k\geq 2$ line segments is the simplest
extension of linear separability, defining much easier goal for the learning
process. Simple problems are 2-separable, but problems with inherent complex
logic may be solved in a simple way by $k$-separable projections. The
difficulty of learning non-linear data distributions is shifted to separation
of line intervals, simplifying the transformation of data by hidden network
layers. For classification of difficult Boolean problems, such as the parity
problem, linear projection combined with \ksep is sufficient and provides a
powerful new target for learning. More complex targets may also be defined,
changing the goal of learning from linear discrimination to creation of data
distributions that can easily be handled by specialized models selected to
analyze output distributions. This approach can replace many layers of

the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) have found empirical
success in minimizing convex functions over nonconvex sets, but not much has
been done to improve the theoretical understanding of them. In this paper, we
investigate convergence of these heuristics. First, we characterize optimal
solutions of minimization problems involving convex cost functions over
nonconvex constraint sets. We show that these optimal solutions are related to
the fixed point set of the underlying nonconvex Douglas-Rachford operator.
Next, we establish sufficient conditions under which the Douglas-Rachford
splitting heuristic either converges to a point or its cluster points form a
nonempty compact connected set. In the case where the heuristic converges to a
point, we establish sufficient conditions for that point to be an optimal
solution. Then, we discuss how the ADMM heuristic can be constructed from the
Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm. We show that, unlike in the convex case,
the algorithms in our nonconvex setup are not equivalent to each other and have
a rather involved relationship between them. Finally, we comment on convergence

the description logics community is facing. The paper describes a preferential
approach for dealing with exceptions in Description Logics, based on the
rational closure. The rational closure has the merit of providing a simple and
efficient approach for reasoning with exceptions, but it does not allow
independent handling of the inheritance of different defeasible properties of
concepts. In this work we outline a possible solution to this problem by
introducing a variant of the lexicographical closure, that we call skeptical

operators with point interactions in $\mathbb{R}^3$, quantum graphs, and 1-D
photonic crystals. In the case of $N \ge 2$ point interactions, the set of
resonances $\Sigma (H)$ essentially consists of a finite number of sequences
with logarithmic asymptotics. We show how the leading parameters $\mu$ of these
sequences are connected with the geometry of the set $Y=\{y_j\}_{j=1}^N$ of
interaction centers $y_j \in \mathbb{R}^3$. The minimal parameter $\mu^{min}$
corresponds to the sequences with `more narrow' and so more observable
resonances. The asymptotic density of such narrow resonances is described by
the multiplicity of $\mu^{\min}$, which occurs to be connected with the
symmetries of Y and naturally introduces a finite number of classes of
configurations of $Y$. In the case of quantum graphs and 1-D photonic crystals,
the decomposition of $\Sigma(H)$ into a finite number of asymptotic sequences
is proved under additional commensurability conditions. To address the case of
a general quantum graph, we introduce families of special counting and
asymptotic density functions for two types of curved complex strips. The
obtained results and effects are compared with those of obstacle scattering.

response functions, circumventing the reliance on higher-point vertices. This
includes a concise, algebraic derivation of the multiloop flow equations, which
have previously been obtained by diagrammatic considerations. Integrating the
multiloop flow for a given input of the totally irreducible vertex is
equivalent to solving the parquet equations with that input. Hence, one can
tune systems from solvable limits to complicated situations by variation of
one-particle parameters, staying at the fully self-consistent solution of the
parquet equations throughout the flow. Furthermore, we use the resulting
differential form of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the self-energy to
demonstrate one-particle conservation of the parquet approximation and to

  infeasibility for nonlinear programs","33 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the help of a logarithmic barrier augmented Lagrangian function, we can
obtain closed-form solutions of slack variables of logarithmic-barrier problems
of nonlinear programs. As a result, a two-parameter primal-dual nonlinear
system is proposed, which corresponds to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point and the
infeasible stationary point of nonlinear programs, respectively, as one of two
parameters vanishes. Based on this distinctive system, we present a primal-dual
interior-point method capable of rapidly detecting infeasibility of nonlinear
programs. The method generates interior-point iterates without truncation of
the step. It is proved that our method converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point
of the original problem as the barrier parameter tends to zero. Otherwise, the
scaling parameter tends to zero, and the method converges to either an
infeasible stationary point or a singular stationary point of the original
problem. Moreover, our method has the capability to rapidly detect the
infeasibility of the problem. Under suitable conditions, not only the method
can be superlinearly or quadratically convergent to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
point as the original problem is feasible, but also it can be superlinearly or
quadratically convergent to the infeasible stationary point when a problem is
infeasible. Preliminary numerical results show that the method is efficient in
solving some simple but hard problems and some standard test problems from the
CUTE collection, where the superlinear convergence is demonstrated when we
solve two infeasible problems and one well-posed feasible counterexample

Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations have gained significant interest in the
computational fluid dynamics community. Modern machine learning algorithms have
opened up a new area of black-box turbulence models allowing for the tuning of
RANS simulations to increase their predictive accuracy. While several
data-driven turbulence models have been reported, the quantification of the
uncertainties introduced has mostly been neglected. Uncertainty quantification
for such data-driven models is essential since their predictive capability
rapidly declines as they are tested for flow physics that deviate from that in
the training data. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework that
not only improves RANS predictions but also provides probabilistic bounds for
fluid quantities such as velocity and pressure. The uncertainties capture both
model form uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty induced by the limited
training data. An invariant Bayesian deep neural network is used to predict the
anisotropic tensor component of the Reynolds stress. This model is trained
using Stein variational gradient decent algorithm. The computed uncertainty on
the Reynolds stress is propagated to the quantities of interest by vanilla
Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for two test cases that differ
geometrically from the training flows at several different Reynolds numbers.
The prediction enhancement of the data-driven model is discussed as well as the
associated probabilistic bounds for flow properties of interest. Ultimately
this framework allows for a quantitative measurement of model confidence and
uncertainty quantification for flows in which no high-fidelity observations or
prior knowledge is available.

well-known iterative decoding algorithms show poor performances. The main
advantage of our proposed algorithm is that instead of assigning and training
weights for all edges, which turns out to be time-consuming especially for
high-density parity-check matrices, we concentrate on edges which are present
in most of $4$-cycles and removing them gives a girth-$6$ Tanner graph. This
approach, by slight modifications using updated LLRs instead of initial ones,
simultaneously accelerates the training process and improves the error

the skeleton convolutional neural network framework takes in multiple different
scales inputs, by which means the CNN can get representations in different
scales. The proposed attention model will handle the features from different
scale streams respectively and integrate them. Then location attention branch
of the model learns to softly weight the multi-scale features at each pixel
location. Moreover, we add an recalibrating branch, parallel to where location
attention comes out, to recalibrate the score map per class. We achieve quite
competitive results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, which surpass
baseline and related works.

domains such as time information to infer the domain-specific models for the
unseen domains. However, it cannot always be assumed that such metadata can be

detector; i.e., a classifier in pursuit of high classification performance
prefers top-level discriminative video clips that are extremely fragmentary,

model and two alternative cosmological models. The two models are a
quintessence model ($\phi$CDM) and a Coupled Dark Matter-Dark Energy (CDE)
model, both of which have evolving and interacting dark sectors. From $N$-body
adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of these models, we measure the statistics
and quantify the properties of voids over the redshift range $z=1.5-12$: these
include their population size, volumes, shapes and average densities. We find
that the latter property has potential as a probe of cosmology, particularly
dark energy, as significant differences in average void densities exist between
the alternative models and the standard model. We postulate that this signature
arises from an increased evacuation rate of particles out of voids, or an
earlier start to void evacuation, in the alternative models as a direct
consequence of the dynamical scalar field, which also leads to greater void
merger rates. Additionally, differences between the two alternative models are
likely due to the drag force arising from dark sector coupling, acting on dark
matter particles in our coupled model.

called pyramidal affine regression networks (PARN), that estimates
locally-varying affine transformation fields across images. To deal with
intra-class appearance and shape variations that commonly exist among different
instances within the same object category, we leverage a pyramidal model where
affine transformation fields are progressively estimated in a coarse-to-fine
manner so that the smoothness constraint is naturally imposed within deep
networks. PARN estimates residual affine transformations at each level and
composes them to estimate final affine transformations. Furthermore, to
overcome the limitations of insufficient training data for semantic
correspondence, we propose a novel weakly-supervised training scheme that
generates progressive supervisions by leveraging a correspondence consistency
across image pairs. Our method is fully learnable in an end-to-end manner and
does not require quantizing infinite continuous affine transformation fields.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that attempts to estimate
dense affine transformation fields in a coarse-to-fine manner within deep
networks. Experimental results demonstrate that PARN outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods for dense semantic correspondence on various
benchmarks.

quantum information science and technology tasks. In a general entanglement
distribution scheme, a photonic pulse is used to entangle a pair of remote
quantum memories. Most applications require multiple entangled pairs between
remote users, which in turn necessitates several photonic pulses (single
photons) being sent through the channel connecting those users. Here we present
an entanglement distribution scheme using only a single photonic pulse to
entangle an arbitrary number of remote quantum memories. As a consequence the
spatial temporal resources are dramatically reduced. We show how this approach
can be simultaneously combined with an entanglement purification protocol to
generate even higher fidelity entangled pairs. The combined approach is faster
to generate those high quality pairs and requires less resources in terms of
both matter qubits and photons consumed. To estimate the efficiency of our
scheme we derive a normalized rate taking into account the raw rate at which
the users can generate purified entangled pairs divided by the total resources
used. We compare the efficiency of our system with the Deutsch protocol in
which the entangled pairs have been created in a traditional way. Our scheme
outperforms this approach both in terms of generation rate and resources
required. Finally we show how our approach can be extended to more general
error correction and detection schemes with higher normalized generation rates

technological demonstrations, from high power electronics, to nano-scale
quantum bio-imaging with unprecedented sensitivity. However, the full
exploitation of diamond for these applications is often limited by the
uncontrolled nature of the diamond material surface, which suffers from
Fermi-level pinning and hosts a significant density of electro-magnetic noise
sources. These issues occur despite the oxide-free and air-stable nature of the
diamond crystal surface, which should be an ideal candidate for
functionalization and chemical-engineering. In this work we reveal a family of
previously unidentified and near-ubiquitous primal surface defects which we
assign to differently reconstructed surface vacancies. The density of these
defects is quantified with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, their energy
structures are elucidated by ab initio calculations, and their effect on
near-surface quantum probes is measured directly. Subsequent ab-initio
calculation of band-bending from these defects suggest they are the source of
Fermi-level pinning at most diamond surfaces. Finally, an investigation is
conducted on a broad range of post-growth surface treatments and concludes that
none of them can reproducibly reduce this defect density below the
Fermi-pinning threshold, making this defect a prime candidate as the source for
decoherence-limiting noise in near-surface quantum probes.

recognition process by extracting a sparse matrix from a video. However, the
proposed system maintains the required motion information for recognizing the
activity. The proposed method has been tested on the MSR Action 3D dataset and
has shown comparable performances with respect to the state-of-the-art. We also
apply the proposed method on our own dataset, where the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

estimation of the displacement of myocardial tissue and hence LV strain has
been challenging due to a variety of issues, including those related to

surface points are set up as nodes in the network and edges define neighborhood
relationships temporally. The novelty lies in the constraints that are imposed
on the matching scheme, which render the correspondences one-to-one through the
entire cardiac cycle, and not just two consecutive frames. The constraints also
encourage motion to be cyclic, which is an important characteristic of LV
motion. We validate our method by applying it to the estimation of quantitative
LV displacement and strain estimation using 8 synthetic and 8 open-chested

is based on Horn Clauses like Prolog but employs implementation techniques,
such as Semi-naive Fixpoint and Magic Sets, that extend the bottom-up
computation model of relational systems, and thus obtain the performance and
scalability that relational systems had achieved, as far back as the 80s, using
data-parallelization on shared-nothing architectures. But this goal proved
difficult to achieve because of major issues at (i) the language level and (ii)
at the system level. The paper describes how (i) was addressed by simple rules
under which the fixpoint semantics extends to programs using count, sum and
extrema in recursion, and (ii) was tamed by parallel compilation techniques
that achieve scalability on multicore systems and Apache Spark. This paper is
under consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming
(TPLP).

particular logarithmic barrier positive relaxation problem with barrier and
scaling parameters. Based on the equivalence, a line-search primal-dual
interior-point relaxation method for nonlinear programs is presented. Our
method does not require any primal or dual iterates to be interior-points,
which is prominently different from the existing interior-point methods in the
literature. A new logarithmic barrier penalty function dependent on both primal
and dual variables is used to prompt the global convergence of the method,
where the penalty parameter is updated adaptively. Without assuming any
regularity condition, it is proved that our method will terminate at an
approximate KKT point of the original problem provided the barrier parameter
tends zero. Otherwise, either an approximate infeasible stationary point or an
approximate singular stationary point of the original problem will be found.
Some preliminary numerical results are reported, including the results for a
well-posed problem for which many line-search interior-point methods were
demonstrated not to be globally convergent, a feasible problem for which the
LICQ and the MFCQ fail to hold at the solution and an infeasible problem, and
for some standard test problems of the CUTE collection. These results show that
our algorithm is not only efficient for well-posed feasible problems, but also
is applicable for some ill-posed feasible problems and some even infeasible

However, there
are some properties of the solar system that are peculiar in this context.
First, the cumulative mass of all objects beyond Neptune (TNOs) is only a
fraction of what one would expect. Second, unlike the planets themselves, the
TNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly
on inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This
implies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its
formation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the
zone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an
important part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study
presented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighbouring star can
simultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 AU and excite
the TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In
the past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant
development stage. However, our numerical simulations show that such a scenario
is much more likely than previously anticipated. A fly-by also naturally
explains the puzzling fact that Neptune has a higher mass than Uranus. Our
simulations suggest that many additional Sednoids at high inclinations still
await discovery, perhaps including bodies like the postulated planet X.

semiconducting systems is important, and might open up possible technological
applications. Using extensive first-principle calculations within a
time-dependent density functional theory framework, we show how the in-plane

for the case of multilayer hexagonal BN layered systems. Whereas the in-plane
HHG is found not to be strongly altered by the stacking of the layers, we found
that the out-of-plane response is strongly affected by the number of layers
considered. This is explained by the interplay between the induced electric
field by electron-electron interactions and the interlayer delocalization of
the wave-functions contributing most to the HHG signal. The gliding of a
bilayer is also found to affect the high-harmonic emission. Our results will
have important ramifications for the experimental study of monolayer and
few-layer two-dimensional materials beyond the case of hexagonal BN studied

quantization between the data and cluster centroids will inevitably harm the

networks to characterize the neighborhood relationships, i.e., the density
function of nearest neighbors with respect to the query. The proposed
probability-based ranking can replace the conventional distance-based ranking

intractably large due to the combinatorial explosion. We propose a novel
efficient algorithm to jointly learn relevant subgraph patterns and nonlinear

subgraph features and models are based on search for single best subgraph
features with specific pruning and boosting procedures of adding their
indicators one by one, which result in linear models of subgraph indicators. In
contrast, the proposed approach is based on directly learning regression trees
for graph inputs using a newly derived bound of the total sum of squares for
data partitions by a given subgraph feature, and thus can learn nonlinear

sufficiently model five of the nine host galaxies. Based on the fitting
parameters, mainly the S\'{e}rsic index, all of them are disk-like galaxies.
Sources with clearly distinguishable bulge components all have pseudo-bulges,
and four out of five sources show a component resembling a bar. A surprisingly
large fraction, three out of five, show signs of interaction or disturbed
morphology. Our results suggest that spiral galaxies with pseudo-bulges are
able to launch and maintain powerful jets. They also imply that interaction -
mainly minor mergers - may have a role in initially triggering higher levels of
nuclear activity in NLS1 galaxies. Furthermore, our results support the
heterogeneous nature of the NLS1 class and indicate that this diversity is
caused by different evolutionary stages, possibly due to mergers.

matrix and obtain a close complete feature. This encoding mode can also
maintain polarimetric information of scattering matrix completely. At the same
time, in view of this encoding way, we design a corresponding classification
algorithm based on convolution network to combine this feature. Based on sparse
scattering coding and convolution neural network, the polarimetric
convolutional network is proposed to classify PolSAR images by making full use
of polarimetric information. We perform the experiments on the PolSAR images
acquired by AIRSAR and RADARSAT-2 to verify the proposed method. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method get better results
and has huge potential for PolSAR data classification. Source code for sparse
scattering coding is available at

to analyze the dimensions of a set of examples pertaining to point processes,
branching processes, random graphs, random walks, and self-similar discrete

of stellar clumps that, in turn, not only grow the bulge, but also increase the
stellar disk velocity dispersion optimally in less than a billion year.
Subsequently, the galaxy evolves passively without any conspicuous spiral
structure. The final galaxy models resemble remarkably well the morphology and
stellar kinematics of the present-day S0s observed by the Planetary Nebulae
spectrograph. Our findings suggest a natural link between the high-redshift

psychology literature that fairness is key to ensuring high worker
participation. However, existing assignment solutions fall short on modeling
the dynamic fairness metric. In this work, we introduce a new assignment
strategy for crowdsourced delivery tasks. This strategy takes fairness towards
workers into consideration, while maximizing the task allocation ratio. Since
redundant assignments are not possible in delivery tasks, we first introduce a
2-phase allocation model that increases the reliability of a worker to complete
a given task. To realize the effectiveness of our model in practice, we present
both offline and online versions of our proposed algorithm called F-Aware.
Given a task-to-worker bipartite graph, F-Aware assigns each task to a worker
that minimizes unfairness, while allocating tasks to use worker capacities as
much as possible. We present an evaluation of our algorithms with respect to
running time, task allocation ratio (TAR), as well as unfairness and assignment
ratio. Experiments show that F-Aware runs around 10^7 x faster than the
TAR-optimal solution and allocates 96.9% of the tasks that can be allocated by
it. Moreover, it is shown that, F-Aware is able to provide a much fair

dynamical instability of self-gravitating spiral arms of magnetised gas,
focusing on the effect of toroidal magnetic fields. Spiral arms can be
destabilised by the toroidal fields which cancel Coriolis force, i.e.
magneto-Jeans instability. Our analysis can be applied to multi-component
systems that consist of gas and stars. To test our analysis, we perform ideal
magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies and examine the
simulation results. We find that our analysis can characterise dynamical
instability leading arms to fragment and form clumps if magnetic fields are
nearly toroidal. We propose that dimensionless growth rate of the most unstable
perturbation, which is computed from our analysis, can be used to predict
fragmentation of spiral arms within an orbital time-scale. Our analysis is
applicable as long as magnetic fields are nearly toroidal. Using our analytic
model, we estimate a typical mass of clumps forming from spiral-arm
fragmentation to be consistent with observed giant clumps $\sim10^{7-8}~{\rm
M_\odot}$. Furthermore, we find that, although the magnetic destabilisation can
cause low-density spiral arms to fragment, the estimated mass of resultant
clumps is almost independent from strength of magnetic fields since marginal
instability occurs at long wavelengths which compensate the low densities of

with a centralised organisation has given place to the viewpoint of cities in
disequilibrium and organised from bottom to up. In this perspective, cities are
evolving systems that exhibit emergent phenomena built from local decisions.
While urban evolution promotes the emergence of positive social phenomena such
as the formation of innovation hubs and the increase in cultural diversity, it
also yields negative phenomena such as increases in criminal activity. Yet, we
are still far from understanding the driving mechanisms of these phenomena. In
particular, approaches to analyse urban phenomena are limited in scope by
neglecting both temporal non-stationarity and spatial heterogeneity. In the
case of criminal activity, we know for more than one century that crime peaks
during specific times of the year, but the literature still fails to
characterise the mobility of crime. Here we develop an approach to describe the
spatial, temporal, and periodic variations in urban quantities. With crime data
from 12 cities, we characterise how the periodicity of crime varies spatially
across the city over time. We confirm one-year criminal cycles and show that
this periodicity occurs unevenly across the city. These `waves of crime' keep
travelling across the city: while cities have a stable number of regions with a
circannual period, the regions exhibit non-stationary series. Our findings
support the concept of cities in a constant change, influencing urban
phenomena---in agreement with the notion of cities not in equilibrium.

The bulk properties of Type Ia supernova remnants, such as the radius and the
centroid energy of the Fe K$\alpha$ blend in the X-ray spectrum, are determined
by the properties of the supernova ejecta and the ambient medium. We model the
interaction between Chandrasekhar and sub-Chandrasekhar models for Type Ia

not modify their surroundings significantly on scales of a few pc. Ambient
medium density and expansion age are the main contributors to the diversity of

criteria. Using the linear programming formulation of the constrained
discounted cost problem, we prove the asymptotic convergence of the optimal
value of the finite-state model to the optimal value of the original model.
With further continuity condition on the transition probability, we also
establish a method to compute approximately optimal policies. For the average
cost, instead of using the finite-state linear programming approximation
method, we use the original problem definition to establish the finite-state
asymptotic approximation of the constrained problem and compute approximately
optimal policies. Under Lipschitz type regularity conditions on the components
of the MDP, we also obtain explicit rate of convergence bounds quantifying how
the approximation improves as the size of the approximating finite state space
increases.

combines role-playing, model demonstrations, single photon interference and
gravitational wave detection, plus simple experiments designed to emphasize the
quantum interpretation of interference. We compare understanding and attitudes
through pre and post testing on four age groups (school years 7, 8, 9 and 10),
and compare results with those of longer interventions with Year 9. Results
indicate that neither prior knowledge nor age are significant factors in
student understanding of the core concepts of Einsteinian physics. However we
find that the short interventions are insufficient to enable students to

challenges in mobile robotics. It constitutes a robust, accurate and

Yet, in highly dynamic environments, like crowded city streets, problems arise
as major parts of the image can be covered by dynamic objects. Consequently,
visual odometry pipelines often diverge and the localization systems
malfunction as detected features are not consistent with the precomputed 3D
model. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect dynamic
object instances to improve the robustness of vision-based localization and
mapping in crowded environments. By training a convolutional neural network
model with a combination of synthetic and real-world data, dynamic object
instance masks are learned in a semi-supervised way. The real-world data can be
collected with a standard camera and requires minimal further post-processing.
Our experiments show that a wide range of dynamic objects can be reliably
detected using the presented method. Promising performance is demonstrated on
our own and also publicly available datasets, which also shows the
generalization capabilities of this approach.

and matter fields -- commonly referred to as geometrodynamics -- for spin-$0$

(i) the action principle should apply and that(ii) the total action should by
form-invariant under the (local) diffeomorphism group. The second postulate
thus implements the Principle of General Relativity. According to Noether's
theorem, this physical symmetry gives rise to a conserved Noether current, from
which the complete set of theories compatible with both postulates can be
deduced. This finally results in a new generic Einstein-type equation, which
can be interpreted as an energy-momentum balance equation emerging from the
Lagrangian $L_{R}$ for the source-free dynamics of gravitation and the
energy-momentum tensor of the source system $L_{0}$. Provided that the system
has no other symmetries -- such as SU$(N)$ -- the canonical energy-momentum
tensor turns out to be the correct source term of gravitation. For the case of
massive spin particles, this entails an increased weighting of the kinetic
energy over the mass in their roles as the source of gravity as compared to the
metric energy momentum tensor, which constitutes the source of gravity in
Einstein's General Relativity. We furthermore confirm that a massive vector
field necessarily acts as a source for torsion of spacetime. Thus, from the
viewpoint of our generic Einstein-type equation, Einstein's General Relativity
constitutes the particular case for spin-$0$ and massless spin particle fields,
and the Hilbert Lagrangian $L_{R,H}$ as the model for the source-free dynamics
of gravitation.

organization of a network. To end this, we introduce a gradient descent machine
learning (ML) approach and genetic algorithms to learn larger functional motifs
in contrast to an (unfeasible) exhaustive search. We use the French Flag (FF)
and Switch functional motif as case studies motivated from biology. While our
algorithm successfully learns large functional motifs, we identify a threshold
size of approximately 20 nodes beyond which learning breaks down. Therefore we
investigate the stability of the motifs. We find that the size of the real
negative eigenvalues of the Jacobian decreases with increasing system size,
thus conferring instability. Finally, without imposing learning an input-output
for all the components of the network, we observe that unconstrained middle
components of the network still learn the desired function, a form of
homogeneous team learning. We conclude that the size limitation of
learnability, most likely due to stability constraints, impose a definite
requirement for modularity in networked systems while enabling team learning
within unconstrained parts of the module. Thus, the observation that community
structures and modularity are abundant in biological networks could be
accounted for by a computational compositional network structure.

past 20 years as well as recent analyses show a continuity in properties (e.g.,
Balmer line profiles, blueshifts of high-ionization lines) between sources with
FWHM above and below 2000 km/s, the defining boundary of NLSy1s. This finding
alone suggests that comparisons between samples of NLSy1s and rest of
broad-line AGNs are most likely biased. NLSy1s can be properly contextualized
by their location on the quasar main sequence originally defined by Sulentic et
al 2000. At one end, NLSy1s encompass sources with strong FeII emission and
associated with high Eddington ratio that hold the promise of becoming useful
distance indicators; at the other end, at least some of them are sources with
broad profiles seen face-on. Any rigid FWHM limit gives rise to some physical
ambiguity, as the FWHM of low-ionization lines depends in a complex way on
mass, Eddington ratio, orientation, and luminosity. In addition, if the scaling
derived from luminosity and virial dynamics applies to the broad line regions,
NLSy1s at luminosity higher than 1E47 erg/s become physically impossible.
Therefore, in a broader context, a proper subdivision of two distinct classes
of AGNs and quasars may be achieved by the distinction between Pop. A and B
with boundary at = 4000 km/s in samples at z < 1, or on the basis of
spectrophotometric properties which may ultimately be related to differences in
accretion modes if high-luminosity quasars are considered.

presence of single and double elliptical antidots. For the spin waves
propagation along the principal antidot lattice axis, the spectrum consists of
flat bands separated by several frequency gaps which are the effect of spin
wave amplitude confinement in the regions between antidots. Contrarily, for
propagation direction at 45 degrees with respect to the antidot symmetry axis,
straight and narrow channels of propagation are formed, leading to broadening
of bands and closing of the magnonics gaps. Interestingly, in this case, extra

solar and geophysical studies. Hathaway (Solar Physics, 286, 347, 2013) found a
curious behaviour in this parameter for small sunspot groups (areas smaller
than 100 millionths of solar hemisphere, msh) using records from Royal
Greenwich Observatory (RGO). Hathaway showed that penumbra-umbra ratio
decreased smoothly from more than 7 in 1905 to lower than 3 by 1930 and then
increased to almost 8 in 1961. Thus, Hathaway proposed the existence of a
secular variation in the penumbra-umbra area ratio. In order to confirm that
secular variation, we employ data of the sunspot catalogue published by the
Coimbra Astronomical Observatory (COI) for the period 1929-1941. Our results
disagree with the penumbra-umbra ratio found by Hathaway for that period.
However, the behaviour of this ratio for large (areas greater or equal than 100
msh) and small groups registered in COI during 1929-1941 is similar to data
available from RGO for the periods 1874-1914 and 1950-1976. Nevertheless, while
the average values and time evolution of the ratio in large groups is similar
to the ratio for small groups according to Coimbra data (1929-1941) it is not
analogous for RGO data for the same period. We also found that the behaviour of
the penumbra-umbra area ratio for smaller groups in both observatories is
significantly different. The main difference between the area measurements made
in Coimbra and RGO is associated with the umbra measurements. We would like to
stress that the two observatories used different methods of observation and
while in COI both methodology and instruments did not change during the study
period, some changes were carried out in RGO that could have affected
measurements of umbra and penumbra. These facts illustrate the importance of
the careful recovery of past solar data.

performed by the Devito compiler through a series of intermediate

advanced common sub-expressions elimination, tiling and parallelization. Some
of these are obtained through well-established stencil optimizers, integrated

reheating, but also lead to the baryon asymmetry and the asymmetric cold dark

eccentricity of some post-AGB intermediate binaries (post-AGBIBs), i.e., those

framework of the GEE, the extra energy to sustain a high mass loss rate comes
from the accretion of mass from the giant envelope or its slow wind onto a more
compact secondary star. The secondary star energizes the outflow from the AGB
outer envelope by launching jets from the accretion disk.

(3D) Dirac semimetals are vital towards their application in high performance

photoexcited carriers of 3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 are investigated by
transient terahertz spectroscopy. The visible pump-THz probe spectroscopy
measurement shows clear biexponential decays with two characteristic time
constants. According to the pump-power and temperature dependence, these two
characteristic time constants are attributed to the electron phonon coupling
(1-4 ps) and anharmonic decay of hot coupled phonons to electronic uncoupled
phonons (2-9 ps), respectively. An anomalous electron-optical phonon coupling
reduction and a bottleneck slowing of hot optical phonons relaxation are
observed with higher excitation intensities similar to that in graphene. On the
other hand, the electron-optical phonon coupling can be enhanced due to the
phonon frequency broadening and softening at elevated lattice temperature.
Furthermore, the transient THz spectrum response is strongly modified by the
phonon assisted intraband absorption of hot carriers from a pure electronic
Drude model, which is evidenced by a characteristic THz absorption dip in the
transient THz absorption spectrum. This absorption dip is pinned by the
discrete optical phonon energy that assists the intraband transition enabled by
photoexcitation of hot carriers.

robots can support first-responders in such situations. However, first-person
view teleoperation is sub-optimal in difficult terrains, while a third-person
perspective can drastically increase teleoperation performance. Here, we
propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based system that can autonomously provide
third-person perspective to ground robots. While our approach is based on local
visual servoing, it further leverages the global localization of several ground
robots to seamlessly transfer between these ground robots in GPS-denied
environments. Therewith one MAV can support multiple ground robots on a demand
basis. Furthermore, our system enables different visual detection regimes, and
enhanced operability, and return-home functionality. We evaluate our system in
real-world SaR scenarios.

with the ratio between the evaporation-driven convective flux and diffusive
flux of the polymer coils in the solution. In the case of a diffusion-dominated
solute transport, the solution monotonically dewets the solid substrate by
evaporation, supporting continuous contact line motion and continuous polymer
deposition. However, a convection-dominated transport results in an oscillatory
ratcheting dewetting-wetting motion of the contact line with more pronounced
dewetting phases. The deposition process is then periodic and produces a stripe
pattern. The oscillatory motion of the meniscus differs from the well
documented stick-slip motion of the meniscus, observed as well, and is
attributed to the opposing influences of evaporation and Marangoni stresses,
which alternately dominate the deposition process.

context, we investigated sex-biased dispersal in Armadillidium vulgare, a
terrestrial isopod with a promiscuous mating system. As a proxy for effective
dispersal, we performed a fine-scale investigation of the spatial genetic
structure in males and females, using individuals originating from five
sampling points located within 70 meters of each other. Based on microsatellite
markers and spatial autocorrelation analyses, our results revealed that while
males did not present a significant genetic structure at this geographic scale,
females were significantly and genetically more similar to each other when they
were collected in the same sampling point. As females invest more parental care
than males in A. vulgare, but also because this species is promiscuous and
males experience a high intrasexual competition, our results meet the
predictions of most classical hypotheses for sex-biased dispersal. We suggest
that widening dispersal studies to other isopods or crustaceans, differing in
their ecology or mating system and displaying varying levels of parental care,
might shed light on the processes underlying the evolution of sex-biased

growth of early-type galaxies and how the growth depends on cosmic epoch and
the mass of the halo in which they are embedded. We carried out a photometric
and structural analysis in the rest-frame $V$ band of a mass-selected ($\log
M/M_\odot >10.7$) sample of red-sequence early-type galaxies with
spectroscopic/grism redshift in the general field up to $z=2$ to complement a
previous work presenting an identical analysis but in halos 100 times more
massive and 1000 times denser. We homogeneously derived sizes (effective radii)
fully accounting for the multi-component nature of galaxies and the common
presence of isophote twists and ellipticity gradients. By using these
mass-selected samples, composed of 170 red-sequence early-type galaxies in the
general field and 224 identically selected and analyzed in clusters, we isolate
the effect on galaxy sizes of the halo in which galaxies are embedded and its
dependence on epoch. We find that the $\log$ of the galaxy size at a fixed
stellar mass, $\log M/M_\odot= 11$, has increased with epoch at a rate twice as
fast in the field than in cluster in the last 10 Gyr ($0.26\pm0.03$ versus
$0.13\pm0.02$ dex per unit redshift). Red-sequence early-type galaxies in the
general field reached the size of their cousins in denser environment by
$z=0.25\pm0.13$ in spite of being three times smaller at $z\sim2$. Data point
toward a model where size growth is epoch-independent (i.e., $\partial \log r_e
/\partial z = c$), but with a rate $c$ depending on environment, $\partial c
/\partial \log M_{halo} \approx 0.05$. Environment determines the growth rate
($d \log r_e / dz$) at all redshifts, indicating an external origin for the
galaxy growth without any clear epoch where it ceases to have an effect.

In past few years, efforts have been made in optimizing the material
composition and structure geometry, and the conversion efficiency has been
improved close to that of ZnTe crystal. One of the drawbacks of the current
designs is the rather limited laser absorption - more than 50% energy is wasted
and the conversion efficiency is thus limited. Here, we theoretically propose
and experimentally demonstrate a novel device that fully utilizes the laser
intensity and significantly improves the conversion efficiency. The device,
which consists of a metal-dielectric photonic crystal structure, utilizes the
interference between the multiple scattering waves to simultaneously suppress
the reflection and transmission of the laser, and to reshape the laser field
distributions. The experimentally detected laser absorption and THz generations
show one-to-one correspondence with the theoretical calculations. We achieve
the strongest THz pulse emission that presents a 1.7 times improvement compared
to the currently designed spintronic emitter. This work opens a new pathway to
improve the performance of spintronic THz emitter from the perspective of

  using Dyson Schwinger equations","28 figures, 19 pages",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Implications of additional fundamental scalar fields are regarded as among
the most important avenues to explore after the experimental discovery of the
standard model Higgs, particularly when there already exist cogent arguments in
favor of their existence. A peculiar observation in Higgs-scalar singlet system
is tendency of scalar singlet field to have negative squared physical masses
which may be a sign of either a tachyon field or symmetry breaking. Assuming
that this feature is due to the presence of a phenomenon similar to the
conventionally understood Higgs mechanism, Wick Cutkosky model is studied in
the parameter space suggested by the classical ground state of the system at
Higgs mass $125.09$ GeV with positive values for both squared bare masses. The
results are found to have strong negative contributions to squared scalar
masses. For higher cutoff values, the renormalized squared scalar masses and
squared bare couplings are found to qualitatively favor a relationship similar
to the one in the classical ground state of the system, upto an additive
constant. Higgs propagators remain almost unaffected as observed in a
previously explored region of parameter space. However, scalar singlet
propagators are found to have relatively different qualitative features in
comparison to the previous study of the model. Vertices are found to have
qualitatively similar features. No sign of triviality is found.

correlation between the GC average colour and luminosity, especially in those
systems associated with massive elliptical galaxies. More luminous (more
massive) GCs are typically redder and hence more metal-rich. This 'blue tilt'
is often interpreted as a mass-metallicity relation stemming from GC
self-enrichment, whereby more massive GCs retain a greater fraction of the
enriched gas ejected by their evolving stars, fostering the formation of more
metal-rich secondary generations. We examine the E-MOSAICS simulations of the
formation and evolution of galaxies and their GC populations, and find that
their GCs exhibit a colour-luminosity relation similar to that observed in
local galaxies, without the need to invoke mass-dependent self-enrichment. We
find that the blue tilt is most appropriately interpreted as a dearth of
massive, metal-poor GCs: the formation of massive GCs requires high
interstellar gas surface densities, conditions that are most commonly fostered
by the most massive, and hence most metal rich, galaxies, at the peak epoch of
GC formation. The blue tilt is therefore a consequence of the intimate coupling
between the small-scale physics of GC formation and the evolving properties of
interstellar gas hosted by hierarchically-assembling galaxies.

hypothesis that galaxy encounters are effective in driving gas inflow toward

validated on synthetic models, usually obtained by randomly generating: (i) an
undirected graph, and (ii) a compatible symmetric positive definite (SPD)
matrix. In order to ensure positive definiteness in (ii), a dominant diagonal
is usually imposed. However, the link strengths in the resulting graphical
model, determined by off-diagonal entries in the SPD matrix, are in many
scenarios extremely weak. Recovering the structure of the undirected graph thus
becomes a challenge, and algorithm validation is notably affected. In this
paper, we propose an alternative method which overcomes such problem yet
yielding a compatible SPD matrix. We generate a partially row-wise-orthogonal
matrix factor, where pairwise orthogonal rows correspond to missing edges in
the undirected graph. In numerical experiments ranging from moderately dense to
sparse scenarios, we obtain that, as the dimension increases, the link strength
we simulate is stable with respect to the structure sparsity. Importantly, we
show in a real validation setting how structure recovery is greatly improved
for all learning algorithms when using our proposed method, thereby producing a
more realistic comparison framework.

  Nowak","Evolution of Cooperation on Stochastic Block Models",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperation is a major factor in the evolution of human societies. The
structure of human social networks, which affects the dynamics of cooperation
and other interpersonal phenomena, have common structural signatures. One of
these signatures is the tendency to organize as groups. Among the generative
models that network theorists use to emulate this feature is the Stochastic
Block Model (SBM). In this paper, we study evolutionary game dynamics on SBM
networks. Using a recently-discovered duality between evolutionary games and
coalescing random walks, we obtain analytical conditions such that natural
selection favors cooperation over defection. We calculate the transition point
for each community to favor cooperation. We find that a critical
inter-community link creation probability exists for given group density, such
that the overall network supports cooperation even if individual communities
inhibit it. As a byproduct, we present mean-field solutions for the critical
benefit-to-cost ratio which perform with remarkable accuracy for diverse
generative network models, including those with community structure and
heavy-tailed degree distributions. We also demonstrate the generalizability of
the results to arbitrary two-player games.

Concretely, a novel unsupervised audiovisual learning model is proposed, named

clustering with multimodal vectors of convolutional maps in different shared

new horizons for the wireless ecosystem in which a very large number of mobile
low power devices interact to run sophisticated applications. The main
hindrance to the massive deployment of low power nodes is most probably the
prohibitive maintenance cost of battery replacement and the ecotoxicity of the
battery production/end-of-life. An emerging research direction to avoid battery
replacement is the combination of radio frequency energy harvesting and mobile
computing (MC). In this paper, we propose the use of simultaneous information
and power transfer (SWIPT) to control the distributed computation process while
delivering power to perform the computation tasks requested. A real-time MC
system is considered, meaning that the trade-off between the information rate
and the energy harvested must be carefully chosen to guarantee that the CPU may
perform tasks of given complexity before receiving a new control signal. In
order to provide a system-level perspective on the performance of SWIPT-MC
networks, we propose a mathematical framework based on stochastic geometry to
characterise the rate-energy trade-off of the system. The resulting achievable
performance region is then put in relation with the CPU energy consumption to
investigate the operating conditions of real-time computing systems. Finally,
numerical results illustrate the joint effect of the network densification and
the propagation environment on the optimisation of the CPU usage.

scalings}) are frequently used for ordinary differential equations that model
(bio-) chemical reaction networks. They are motivated by quasi-steady state
(QSS) of certain chemical species, and ideally lead to slow-fast systems for
singular perturbation reductions, in the sense of Tikhonov and Fenichel. In the
present paper we discuss properties of such scaling transformations, with
regard to their applicability as well as to their determination.
Transformations of this type are admissible only when certain consistency
conditions are satisfied, and they lead to singular perturbation scenarios only
if additional conditions hold, including a further consistency condition on
initial values. Given these consistency conditions, two scenarios occur. The
first (which we call standard) is well known and corresponds to a classical
quasi-steady state (QSS) reduction. Here, scaling may actually be omitted
because there exists a singular perturbation reduction for the unscaled system,
with a coordinate subspace as critical manifold. For the second (nonstandard)
scenario scaling is crucial. Here one may obtain a singular perturbation
reduction with the slow manifold having dimension greater than expected from
the scaling. For parameter dependent systems we consider the problem to find
all possible scalings, and we show that requiring the consistency conditions
allows their determination. This lays the groundwork for algorithmic
approaches, to be taken up in future work. In the final section we consider
some applications. In particular we discuss relevant nonstandard reductions of
certain reaction-transport systems.

monitoring to plan the schedule, intensity and volume of training, and
subsequent recovery. In sports medicine, ECG-based analyses are well
established. However, they rarely consider the correspondence of respiratory
and cardiac activity. Given such mutual influence, we hypothesize that athlete
monitoring might be developed with causal inference and that detailed,
time-related techniques should be preceded by a more general, time-independent
approach that considers the whole group of participants and parameters
describing whole signals. The aim of this study was to discover general causal
paths among cardiac and respiratory variables in elite athletes in two body
positions (supine and standing), at rest. ECG and impedance pneumography
signals were obtained from 100 elite athletes. The mean HR, the RMSSD, its
natural logarithm, the mean respiratory rate, the breathing activity
coefficients, and the resulting breathing regularity were estimated. Several
causal discovery frameworks were applied: generalized correlations, CAM, FGES,
GFCI, and two Bayesian network learning algorithms: Hill-Climbing and Tabu. The
main, still mild, rules best supported by data are: for supine - tidal volume
causes heart activity variation, which causes HR, which causes respiratory
timing; and for standing - normalized respiratory activity variation causes
average heart activity. The presented approach allows data-driven and
time-independent analysis of elite athletes as a particular population, without
considering prior knowledge. However, the results seem to be consistent with
the medical background. Causality inference is an interesting mathematical
approach to the analysis of biological responses, which are complex. One can
use it to profile athletes and plan appropriate training.

correlations present in composite quantum systems, both in finite and infinite
dimensions. We investigate the consequence on the violation of local realism
based on pseduospin operators when photons are added or subtracted in a single
mode or in both the modes of the two-mode squeezed states of light in presence
of noise. In the noiseless situation, we show that for addition (subtraction)
of photons in a single mode, there is an overall enhancement in the maximal
violation, although we observe an interplay between monotonicity and
non-monotonicity in the violation of Bell inequality depending on the squeezing
strength. Moreover, we report that for low squeezing or low number of photons
added or subtracted, subtraction in both the modes can lead to higher violation
of local realism than that in the case of addition. For any choice of
parameters, such ordering is not seen if one compares their entanglement
contents. In the event of a faulty twin-beam generator, we obtain a
lower-than-expected squeezing in the state. In such a case, or in imperfect
photon addition (subtraction), or under local noise, we find that the violation
of local realism by the noise-affected two-mode squeezed states always
decreases. Interestingly however, we notice that photon addition (subtraction)
can in general help to conquer the ill-effects of noise by enhancing the
violation of local realism or by transforming non-violating states to violating
ones, thereby acting as an activating agent.

We study a higher-dimensional version of the coequaliser/kernel pair

exact Mal'tsev category. We first ask ourselves how this adjunction restricts
to an equivalence of categories. This leads to the concept of an effective
$n$-fold equivalence relation, corresponding to the $n$-fold regular

parallelistic $n$-fold equivalence relations. We then further restrict the

congruence distributivity condition, resulting in a denormalised $3^n$-Lemma
valid in exact Mal'tsev categories. We deduce a $3^n$-Lemma for short exact

between joins and meets of normal subobjects. This turns out to be new even in

agents can adopt two opinions, optimistic or pessimistic, and can change them
by means of an imitation (herding) and an intrinsic (noise) mechanisms. An
ensemble of noisy voters undergoes a finite-size phase transition, upon
increasing the relative importance of the noise to the herding, form a bimodal
phase where most of the agents shear the same opinion to a unimodal phase where
almost the same fraction of agent are in opposite states. By the inclusion of
contrarians we allow for some voters to adopt the opposite opinion of other
agents (anti-herding). We first consider the case of only contrarians and show
that the only possible steady state is the unimodal one. More generally, when
voters and contrarians are present, we show that the bimodal-unimodal
transition of the noisy voter model prevails only if the number of contrarians
in the system is smaller than four, and their characteristic rates are small
enough. For the number of contrarians bigger or equal to four, the voters and
the contrarians can be seen only in the unimodal phase. Moreover, if the number
of voters and contrarians, as well as the noise and herding rates, are of the

approximated by the Gaussian distribution.

drastically reduces the number of parameters to estimate and make the problem
tractable. When both the responses and the covariates are multivariate,
estimators constructed by the inverse regression are studied in this paper, the

mechanical noise tolerable in our proposal and predict a critical temperature
below which the morphing between wave and particle states can be effectively
observed in the presence of environment-induced fluctuations. Furthermore, we
describe how to amplify single-phonon excitations of the mechanical-resonator
superposition states to a macroscopic level, via squeezing the mechanical
modes. This approach corresponds to the phase-covariant cloning. Therefore, our
proposal can serve as a test of macroscopic quantum superpositions of massive
objects even with large excitations. This work, which describes a fundamental
test of the limits of quantum mechanics at the macroscopic scale, would have
implications for quantum metrology and quantum information processing.

computed the half peak-to-peak variability of the HARPS RV measurements, namely
DeltaRV/2, for each target, to search for the best planet-host candidates. We
also performed time series analysis for a few targets with enough observations
to search for orbital solutions. Although we attempted to rule out the presence
of binaries on the basis of previous surveys, we detected 14 new binary
candidates in our sample, most of them identified from a comparison between
HARPS and CORAVEL data. We also suggest 11 new planet-host candidates based on
a relation between the stellar surface gravity and DeltaRV/2. Ten of the
candidates have less than 3 Msun, showing evidence of a low planet occurrence
rate for massive stars. One of the planet-host candidates and one of the binary
candidates show very clear RV periodic variations, allowing us to confirm the
discovery of a new planet and to compute the orbital solution for the binary.
The planet is IC 4651 9122b, with a minimum mass of msini = 6.3 MJ and a

perspective an alternative mechanistic paradigm for photoinduced water
splitting with carbon nitrides, which focusses on the specific features of the
photochemistry of aromatic N-heterocycles in aqueous environments. It is shown
that a water molecule which is hydrogen-bonded to an N-heterocycle can be
decomposed into hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals by two simple sequential
photochemical reactions. This concept is illustrated by first-principles
calculations of excited-state reaction paths and their energy profiles for
hydrogen-bonded complexes of pyridine, triazine and heptazine with a water

estimate the gradient appearing in the corresponding iterative algorithms.
Since the challenging case of feedback with \emph{unknown} delays prevents one
from constructing the sought gradient estimates, existing MAB and BCO
algorithms become intractable. For such challenging setups, delayed
exploration, exploitation, and exponential (DEXP3) iterations, along with
delayed bandit gradient descent (DBGD) iterations are developed for MAB and
BCO, respectively. Leveraging a unified analysis framework, it is established
that the regret of DEXP3 and DBGD are ${\cal O}\big( \sqrt{K\bar{d}(T+D)}

dependence on cluster global properties, in a homogeneous and unbiased way. Our
study is based on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS)
photometric galaxy catalogue,associated with photometric redshifts. We
constructed LFs inside a scaled radius using a selection in photometric
redshift around the cluster spectroscopic redshift in order to reduce
projection effects. The width of the photometric redshift selection was
carefully determined to avoid biasing the LF and depended on both the cluster
redshift and the galaxy magnitudes. The purity was then enhanced by applying a
precise background subtraction. We constructed composite luminosity functions
(CLFs) by stacking the individual LFs and studied their evolution with redshift
and richness, analysing separately the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and
non-BCG members. We fitted the dependences of the CLFs and BCG distributions
parameters with redshift and richness conjointly in order to distinguish
between these two effects. We find that the usual photometric redshift
selection methods can bias the LF estimate if the redshift and magnitude
dependence of the photometric redshift quality is not taken into account. Our
main findings concerning the evolution of the galaxy luminosity distribution
with redshift and richness are that, in the inner region of clusters and in the
redshift-mass range we probe (about $0<z<1$ and $10^{13}
M_{\odot}<M_{500}<5\times10^{14}M_{\odot}$), the bright part of the LF (BCG
excluded) does not depend much on mass or redshift except for its amplitude,
whereas the BCG luminosity increases both with redshift and richness, and its
scatter decreases with redshift.

network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). In fact, even well-designed, and
frequently-updated signature-based NIDS cannot detect the zero-day treats due
to the lack of an adequate signature database, adaptive to intelligent attacks
on the Internet. More importantly, having an NIDS, it should be tested on
malicious traffic dataset that not only represents known attacks, but also can
to some extent reflect the characteristics of unknown, zero-day attacks.
Generating such traffic is identified in the literature as one of the main
obstacles for evaluating the effectiveness of NIDS. To address these issues, we
introduce RNNIDS that applies Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to find complex
patterns in attacks and generate similar ones. In this regard, for the first

attacks as well as synthetic signatures from the most advanced malware to
improve the intrusion detection rate. Besides, to further enhance the design of
an NIDS, RNNs can be employed to generate malicious datasets containing, e.g.,
unseen mutants of a malware. To evaluate the feasibility of our approaches, we
conduct extensive experiments by incorporating publicly available datasets,
where we show a considerable improvement in the detection rate of an

model, we simulate the kinematics of meteoroids beginning at 180 km with

velocities at the moment of detection to measurements. We validate the
simulations by comparing the simulated luminous beginning heights with observed

given in arXiv:1804.11290 by studying a distributed control problem for this
evolutionary system. The main difficulty in the analysis is to establish a
rigorous Frechet differentiability result for the associated control-to-state
mapping. This seems only to be possible if the state stays bounded, which, in
turn, makes it necessary to postulate an additional global boundedness
assumption. One typical situation, in which this assumption is satisfied,
arises when B is the negative Laplacian with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions
and the nonlinearity is smooth with polynomial growth of at most order four.
Also a case with logarithmic nonlinearity can be handled. Under the global
boundedness assumption, we establish existence and first-order necessary
optimality conditions for the optimal control problem in terms of a variational
inequality and the associated adjoint state system.

frequency regulation to the bulk power system. Specifically, we assess the
prevalence of distribution network constraint violations, such as over- or
under-voltages and overloading of transformers. Our goal is to determine the
set of constraints that are at increased risk of being violated when TCLs
provide regulation. We compare network operation in two cases: first with TCLs
operating freely, and second with TCLs controlled to track a regulation signal.
Using GridLAB-D, we run power flow simulations of five real distribution
networks. Our results indicate that voltage limits are at increased risk of
violation when TCLs provide regulation because of increased voltage variation.
Effects on transformer aging are more nuanced and depend on the method used for
dispatching TCLs. We find that in many distribution networks it may only be
necessary to consider voltage constraints when designing a TCL control strategy
that protects the distribution network.

precision metrology. Nevertheless, demanding applications such as front-end
frequency and time standards, ultrastable microwave generation or
high-resolution spectroscopy still necessitate improved stability. The spectral
bandwidth and absolute position of individual comb lines are crucial in this
context. Typically, both parameters are controlled on short and long time
scales by tight locking to external optical and microwave references which
represent costly and cumbersome additions to the entire setup. Here, we
demonstrate fully self-controlled stabilization of a fibre-based femtosecond
frequency comb requiring neither optical nor radio frequency external
references. In the first step, this technology allows us to optically eliminate
the carrier-envelope phase slip via ultrabroadband difference frequency
generation. The resulting amplification of intrinsically quantum-limited phase
noise from the mode-locked oscillator is elegantly addressed in the second
step. We efficiently suppress these excess fluctuations by a direct transfer of
the superior short-time noise properties of the fundamental oscillator to the
offset-free comb. Our combined scheme provides a high-precision frequency
reference operating completely autonomously, thus marking a new era for
fibre-based sources in advanced applications ranging from space exploration to
tests of the invariability of fundamental constants.

screening scan is critical for reducing false positives. Radiomics holds great
potential to differentiate malignant from benign tumors by extracting and
analyzing a large number of quantitative image features. Since not all radiomic
features contribute to an effective classifying model, selecting an optimal
feature subset is critical. Methods: This work proposes a new multi-objective
based feature selection (MO-FS) algorithm that considers sensitivity and
specificity simultaneously as the objective functions during feature selection.
For MO-FS, we developed a modified entropy based termination criterion (METC)
that stops the algorithm automatically rather than relying on a preset number
of generations. We also designed a solution selection methodology for
multi-objective learning that uses the evidential reasoning approach (SMOLER)
to automatically select the optimal solution from the Pareto-optimal set.
Furthermore, we developed an adaptive mutation operation to generate the
mutation probability in MO-FS automatically. Results: We evaluated the MO-FS
for classifying lung nodule malignancy in low-dose CT and breast lesion
malignancy in digital breast tomosynthesis. Conclusion: The experimental
results demonstrated that the feature set selected by MO-FS achieved better
classification performance than features selected by other commonly used
methods. Significance: The proposed method is general and more effective

(ARs) from the time of their emergence until several days later, when their

following an initial period where the poles of the emerging regions separate
from each other, the poles then reverse direction and start to retract inward;
(b) during the retraction period, flux cancelation occurs along the main
neutral line of the regions; (c) this cancelation builds the sheared core
field/flux rope that eventually erupts to make the CME. In the two cases,
respectively 30% and 50% of the maximum flux of the region cancels prior to the
eruption. Recent studies indicate that solar coronal jets frequently result
from small-scale filaments eruptions, with those ""minifilament"" eruptions also
being built up and triggered by cancelation of magnetic flux. Together, the
small-AR eruptions here and the coronal jet results suggest that isolated
bipolar regions tend to erupt when some threshold fraction, perhaps in the
range of 50%, of the region's maximum flux has canceled. Our observed erupting
filaments/flux ropes form at sites of flux cancelation, in agreement with
previous observations. Thus, the recent finding that minifilaments that erupt
to form jets also form via flux cancelation is further evidence that
minifilaments are small-scale versions of the long-studied full-sized
filaments.

fluid and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, with an emphasis on the latter.
The energy of a turbulent system, an invariant in the non-dissipative case, is
transferred to small scales through nonlinear mode coupling. Fifty years ago,
it was realized that, for a two-dimensional fluid, energy cascades instead to
larger scales, and so does magnetic helicity in three-dimensional MHD. However,
evidence obtained recently indicates that in fact, for a range of governing
parameters, there are systems for which their ideal invariants can be
transferred, with constant fluxes, to both the large scales and the small
scales, as for MHD or rotating stratified flows, in the latter case including
with quasi-geostrophic forcing. Such bi-directional, split, cascades directly
affect the rate at which mixing and dissipation occur in these flows in which
nonlinear eddies interact with fast waves with anisotropic dispersion laws, due
for example to imposed rotation, stratification or uniform magnetic fields. The
directions of cascades can be obtained in some cases through the use of
phenomenological arguments, one of which we derive here following classical
lines in the case of the inverse magnetic helicity cascade in electron MHD.
With more highly-resolved data sets stemming from large laboratory experiments,
high-performance computing and in-situ satellite observations, machine-learning
tools are bringing novel perspectives to turbulence research, e.g. in helping
devise new explicit sub-grid scale parameterizations, which may lead to
enhanced physical insight, including in the future in the case of these new
bi-directional cascades.

  Solution","Published in NeurIPS 2018",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few ideas have enjoyed as large an impact on deep learning as convolution.
For any problem involving pixels or spatial representations, common intuition
holds that convolutional neural networks may be appropriate. In this paper we
show a striking counterexample to this intuition via the seemingly trivial
coordinate transform problem, which simply requires learning a mapping between
coordinates in (x,y) Cartesian space and one-hot pixel space. Although
convolutional networks would seem appropriate for this task, we show that they
fail spectacularly. We demonstrate and carefully analyze the failure first on a
toy problem, at which point a simple fix becomes obvious. We call this solution
CoordConv, which works by giving convolution access to its own input
coordinates through the use of extra coordinate channels. Without sacrificing
the computational and parametric efficiency of ordinary convolution, CoordConv
allows networks to learn either complete translation invariance or varying
degrees of translation dependence, as required by the end task. CoordConv
solves the coordinate transform problem with perfect generalization and 150
times faster with 10--100 times fewer parameters than convolution. This stark
contrast raises the question: to what extent has this inability of convolution
persisted insidiously inside other tasks, subtly hampering performance from
within? A complete answer to this question will require further investigation,
but we show preliminary evidence that swapping convolution for CoordConv can
improve models on a diverse set of tasks. Using CoordConv in a GAN produced
less mode collapse as the transform between high-level spatial latents and
pixels becomes easier to learn. A Faster R-CNN detection model trained on MNIST
showed 24% better IOU when using CoordConv, and in the RL domain agents playing
Atari games benefit significantly from the use of CoordConv layers.

use of real time ad auctions to sell their ad spaces. Multiple auction
platforms, also called Supply-Side Platforms (SSP), were created. Because of
this multiplicity, publishers started to create competition between SSPs. In
this setting, there are two successive auctions: a second price auction in each
SSP and a secondary, first price auction, called header bidding auction,
between SSPs.In this paper, we consider an SSP competing with other SSPs for ad
spaces. The SSP acts as an intermediary between an advertiser wanting to buy ad
spaces and a web publisher wanting to sell its ad spaces, and needs to define a
bidding strategy to be able to deliver to the advertisers as many ads as
possible while spending as little as possible. The revenue optimization of this
SSP can be written as a contextual bandit problem, where the context consists
of the information available about the ad opportunity, such as properties of
the internet user or of the ad placement.Using classical multi-armed bandit
strategies (such as the original versions of UCB and EXP3) is inefficient in
this setting and yields a low convergence speed, as the arms are very
correlated. In this paper we design and experiment a version of the Thompson
Sampling algorithm that easily takes this correlation into account. We combine
this bayesian algorithm with a particle filter, which permits to handle
non-stationarity by sequentially estimating the distribution of the highest bid
to beat in order to win an auction. We apply this methodology on two real
auction datasets, and show that it significantly outperforms more classical
approaches.The strategy defined in this paper is being developed to be deployed

eigenvalues. Counterintuitively, a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, satisfying
combined parity-time (PT) symmetry, could display entirely real spectra above
some phase-transition threshold. Such a counterintuitive discovery has aroused
extensive theoretical interest in extending canonical quantum theory by
including non-Hermitian but PT-symmetric operators in the last two decades.
Despite much fundamental theoretical success in the development of PT-symmetric
quantum mechanics, an experimental observation of pseudo-Hermiticity remains
elusive as these systems with a complex potential seem absent in Nature. But
nevertheless, the notion of PT symmetry has highly survived in many other
branches of physics including optics, photonics, AMO physics, acoustics,
electronic circuits, material science over the past ten years, and others,
where a judicious balance of gain and loss constitutes a PT-symmetric system.
Here, although we concentrate upon reviewing recent progress on PT symmetry in
optical microcavity systems, we also wish to present some new results that may
help to accelerate the research in the area. Such compound photonic structures
with gain and loss provide a powerful platform for testing various theoretical
proposals on PT symmetry, and initiate new possibilities for shaping optical
beams and pulses beyond conservative structures. Throughout this article there
is an effort to clearly present the physical aspects of PT-symmetry in optical
microcavity systems, but mathematical formulations are reduced to the
indispensable ones. Readers who prefer strict mathematical treatments should
resort to the extensive list of references. Despite the rapid progress on the
subject, new ideas and applications of PT symmetry using optical microcavities
are still expected in the future.

reformulated as a gravity analog model, in which thermodynamic variables,
kinetic coefficients and generalized forces form, respectively, coordinates,
metric tensor and vector fields in a space of thermodynamic variables. The
relevant symmetry of the model is the general coordinate transformation. Then,
the entropy production is classified into three categories, when a closed path
is depicted as a thermodynamic cycle. One category is time reversal odd, and is
attributed to the number of lines of magnetic flux passing through the closed
path, having monopole as a source. There are two time reversal even categories,
one of which is attributed to the space curvature around the path, having
gravitational instanton as a source, which dominates for a rapid operation of
the cycle. The last category is the usual one, which remains even for the
quasi-equilibrium operation. It is possible to extend the model to include
non-linear responses. In introducing new terms, important is the dimensional
counting, using two parameters, the temperature and the relaxation time. The
effective action, being induced by the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, is
derived. This is a candidate for the action which controls the dynamics of
kinetic coefficients and thermodynamic forces. An example is given in a
chemical oscillatory reaction in a solvent of the van der Waals type.
Fluctuation-dissipation theorem is examined `a la Onsager, and a derivation of
the gravity analog thermodynamic model from quantum mechanics is sketched,
based on an analogy to the resonance problem.

not easy at all. There are, however, approximation methods of finding a

this article that an approximate solution of an $f(R)$-theory in a general
central field, which is not necessary to be static, can be found perturbatively
around a solution of the Einstein equation in the general theory of relativity.
In particular, vacuum solutions are found for $f(R)$ of general and some
special forms. Further, applications to the investigation of a planetary motion
and light's propagation in a central field are presented. An effect of an
$f(R)$-gravity is also estimated for the SgrA*--S2 system. The latter
gravitational system is much stronger than the Sun--Mercury system, thus the
effect could be much stronger and, thus, much more measurable.

consider a discrete, quantum version of de Sitter Universe with a Planck
time-foliation, to which is applied the quantum version of the holographic
principle (a Planckian pixel encodes one qubit rather than a bit). This results
in a quantum network, where the time steps label the nodes. The quantum
fluctuations of the vacuum are the connecting links of the quantum network,
while the total number of pixels (qubits) of a spatial slice are the outgoing
links from a node n. At each node n there is a couple of quantum gates, the
Hadamard gate (H) and the controlled-not (CNOT) gate, plus a projector P. The
Hadamard gate transforms virtual states (bits) into qubits, the projector P
measures a qubit at the antecedent node, giving rise to a new bit, and the CNOT
gate entangles a qubit at node n with the new bit at node n-1. We show that the
above quantum-computational interpretation of space-time entanglement has a
geometrical counterpart. In fact, the quantum fluctuations of the metric on
slice n are such that a tiny wormhole will connect one Planckian pixel of slice
n with one of slice n-1. By the quantum holographic principle, such a
geometrical connection is space-time entanglement.

calculations in industrial scientific computing codes is an important part of
the Verification, Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) process.
Stochastic Arithmetic is one way to model and estimate FP losses of accuracy,
which scales well to large, industrial codes. It exists in different flavors,
such as CESTAC or MCA, implemented in various tools such as CADNA, Verificarlo
or Verrou. These methodologies and tools are based on the idea that FP losses
of accuracy can be modeled via randomness. Therefore, they share the same need
to perform a statistical analysis of programs results in order to estimate the
significance of the results. In this paper, we propose a framework to perform a
solid statistical analysis of Stochastic Arithmetic. This framework unifies all
existing definitions of the number of significant digits (CESTAC and MCA), and
also proposes a new quantity of interest: the number of digits contributing to
the accuracy of the results. Sound confidence intervals are provided for all
estimators, both in the case of normally distributed results, and in the
general case. The use of this framework is demonstrated by two case studies of
large, industrial codes: Europlexus and code_aster.
