general boosted Kerr black hole relative to a Lorentz frame at future null
infinity. The metric contains five independent parameters -- mass $m$, rotation
$\omega$, boost parameter $v/c$ and the boost direction defined by

describes the most general configuration that an astrophysical black hole must
have. The black hole rotates about the $z$-axis with angular momentum
proportional to $m \omega$ and the geometry has just one Killing vector
$\partial/\partial{u}$, where $u$ is the retarded time coordinate. The boost
turns the ergosphere asymmetric, with dominant lobes in the direction opposite
to the boost. The event and Cauchy horizons, defined for the case $\omega < m$,
are specified respectively by the radii $r_{\pm}=m \pm \sqrt{m^2-\omega^2}$.
The horizons are topologically spherical and the singularity has the topology
of a circle on planes that are orthogonal to the boost direction. We argue that
this black hole geometry is the natural set to describe the remnants of the
recently observed gravitational wave events $GW150914$, $GW151226$, $GW170814$

astrophysical processes in the asymmetric ergosphere and the electromagnetic
dynamical effects that may result from the rotating black hole moving at
relativistic speeds together with the precession of the boost axis about the

may acquire a net drift velocity, and thus operate as a motor or ratchet, even
if the external force is represented by an unbiased time-periodic function or
by a zero-centered noise. For an adequate description of such ratchets, a
conventional Langevin equation linear in the particle's velocity is
insufficient, and one needs to take into account the first nonlinear correction
to the dissipation force which emerges beyond the weak coupling limit. We
derived microscopically the relevant nonlinear Langevin equation by extending
the standard projection operation technique beyond the weak coupling limit. The
particle is modeled as a rigid cluster of atoms and its asymmetry may be
geometrical, compositional (when a cluster is composed of atoms of different
types), or due to a combination of both factors. The drift velocity is
quadratic in the external force's amplitude and increases with decreasing the
force's frequency (for a periodic force) and inverse correlation time (for a
fluctuating force). The maximum value of the drift velocity is independent on
the particle's mass and achieved in the adiabatic limit, i.e. for an infinitely
slow change of the external field.

transform a first-order model-free reinforcement or imitation learning

recursively repeating two steps: In the Prediction Step, the learner uses a

updated policy in the environment, receives the true gradient, and then
corrects the policy using the gradient error. Unlike previous algorithms,
PicCoLO corrects for the mistakes of using imperfect predicted gradients and
hence does not suffer from model bias. The development of PicCoLO is made
possible by a novel reduction from predictable online learning to adversarial
online learning, which provides a systematic way to modify existing first-order

the current Cepheid being more massive. The system age is now $\sim{}$200 My,
and the Cepheid is almost completely stripped of hydrogen, with helium mass of

strip. Comparison with observations indicate a reasonable
$2.7\cdot{}10^{-8}\,M_\odot/y$ mass loss from the Cepheid. The companion is
most probably a Be main-sequence star with $T=22000\,K$ and $R=2.5\,R_\odot$.

detected a two-ring disk ($R_{disk}\sim\,116\,R_{\odot}$) and a shell

combination of the matter from the past mass transfer, the mass being lost by
the Cepheid due to wind and pulsations, and a decretion disk around a rapidly
rotating secondary. Our study together with observational properties of pWVir
stars suggests that their majority are products of a similar binary evolution

symmetric geometries, present in e.g. mechanical metamaterials, can feature an
unlimited number of excess floppy modes that are absent in generic geometries,
and in addition can support floppy modes that are multi-branched. We study the
number $\Delta$ of excess floppy modes by comparing generic and symmetric
geometries with identical topologies, and show that $\Delta$ is extensive,
peaks at intermediate connection densities, and exhibits mean field scaling. We
then develop an approximate yet accurate cluster counting algorithm that

holds for very general notions of history state, and also extends to
quasi-local Hamiltonians with exponentially-decaying interactions.

relations with important bearings on the astrophysics of galaxies, stars, and

and halo, differences in the relation between abundances and elemental

stellar and galaxy evolution, will be possible. Hence, in planning abundance
surveys, it is important to carefully balance the need for large samples of

obtain high-precision abundances. Furthermore, it is an advantage to work
differentially on stars with similar atmospheric parameters, because then a
simple 1D LTE analysis of stellar spectra may be sufficient. However, when

dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) through the driving of electron-nuclear
flip-flop processes at defect centers. This finding raises the question of
whether the nuclear spin coherence times are also impacted by this
hyperpolarization process. Here, we theoretically examine the effect of DNP on
the nuclear spin coherence times as a function of the hyperpolarization drive
time. We do this by developing a microscopic theory of DNP in a nuclear spin
ensemble coupled to microwave-driven defect centers in solids and subject to
spin diffusion mediated by internuclear dipolar interactions. We find that,
similarly to relaxation times, the nuclear spin coherence times can be
increased substantially by a few orders of magnitude depending on the driving
time. Our theoretical model and results will be useful for current and future

period in the 5-65 min range and are predicted to be strong sources of
persistent gravitational wave radiation. Using Gaia Data Release 2, we present
the parallaxes and proper motions of 41 out of the 56 known systems. Compared
to the parallax determined using the HST Fine Guidance Sensor we find that the
archetype star, AM CVn, is significantly closer than previously thought. This
resolves the high luminosity and mass accretion rate which models had
difficulty in explaining. Using Pan-STARRS1 data we determine the absolute
magnitude of the AM CVn stars. There is some evidence that donor stars have a
higher mass and radius than expected for white dwarfs or that the donors are
not white dwarfs. Using the distances to the known AM CVn stars we find strong
evidence that a large population of AM CVn stars have still to be discovered.
As this value sets the background to the gravitational wave signal of LISA,
this is of wide interest. We determine the mass transfer rate for 15 AM CVn
stars and find that the majority have a rate significantly greater than
expected from standard models. This is further evidence that the donor star has
a greater size than expected.

reduced population or gap at intermediate activity, somewhat higher than that

at the highest levels of solar activity. This reduced plage area weakens the
calcium emission and depletes the number of stars of intermediate calcium
emission index. We propose that, in the most active stars, the reduction in
relative plage area is offset by the increased filling factor of photospheric
magnetic fields. So the gap might simply be a consequence of a gradual shift
with age of the stellar dynamo towards production of higher spatial
frequencies.

complicating scenarios where such clouds could survive. Thus, more complex

the Big Bang through a process commonly referred to as Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis. The amount of helium that was made during Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis is determined by the combination of particle physics and
cosmology. The current leading measures of the primordial helium abundance
(Y_P) are based on the relative strengths of H I and He I emission lines
emanating from star-forming regions in local metal-poor galaxies. As the
statistical errors on these measurements improve, it is essential to test for
systematics by developing independent techniques. Here we report the first
determination of the primordial helium abundance based on a near-pristine
intergalactic gas cloud that is seen in absorption against the light of a
background quasar. This gas cloud, observed when the Universe was just
one-third of its present age (z_abs = 1.724), has a metal content ~100 times
less than the Sun, and ~30 per cent less metals than the most metal-poor H II
region currently known where a determination of the primordial helium abundance
is afforded. We conclude that the helium abundance of this intergalactic gas
cloud is Y = 0.250^{+0.033}_{-0.025}, which agrees with the Standard Model
primordial value, Y_P = 0.24672 +/- 0.00017. Our determination of the
primordial helium abundance is not yet as precise as that derived using
metal-poor galaxies, but our method has the potential to offer a competitive

galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Despite their many differences, they
share a common property - they all contain dust. The dust is carried with the
outflow, heated by the AGN, and emits at infrared wavelengths. This paper shows
that the infrared emission of this dust can be used to detect AGN outflows and
derive their properties. We use a sample of about 4000 type II AGN and compare
the infrared properties of systems that show spectroscopic signature of ionized
gas outflows to systems that do not. We detect an additional mid-infrared
emission component in galaxies with spectroscopically discovered winds, and
attribute it to the dust in the outflow. This new component offers novel
constraints on the outflow properties, such as its mean location and covering
factor. We measure the location of the outflow for roughly 1700 systems, with
the distribution showing a prominent peak around 500 pc, a tail that extends to
large distances (10 kpc), and no objects with a location smaller than 50 pc.
The covering factor of the wind shows a wide distribution which is centered
around 0.1, with 24% (8%) of the winds showing covering factors larger than 0.2
(0.5). The dust emission is not sensitive to various systematics affecting
optically-selected outflows, and can be used to estimate the mass outflow rate

never been resummed throughout its entire singular phase space. Using insights
and techniques motivated by modern multi-differential jet substructure
calculations, we are able to predict the $D$-parameter distribution with no
additional phase space cuts. Our approach is to measure both the $C$- and
$D$-parameters on hadronic final states in $e^+e^-$ collisions. We can tune the
value of the $C$-parameter with respect to the $D$-parameter to specify simple,
physical configurations of final state particles in which to perform
calculations. There are three parametric regions that exist: $D \ll C^2\sim 1$,
$D\ll C^2\ll 1$, and $D\sim C^2\ll1$, and we calculate the $D$-parameter in
each region separately. In the first two of these three regions, we present
all-orders factorization theorems and explicitly demonstrate resummation to
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region in which $D\sim C^2\ll1$
corresponds to the dijet limit and where the $D$-parameter loses the property
of additivity. In this region we introduce a systematically-improvable
procedure exploiting properties of conditional probabilities and resum to
approximate next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The contributions from these
regions can be consistently combined, and the value of the $C$-parameter
integrated over to produce the cross section for the $D$-parameter. With these

extreme spatial and mass resolution in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
surrounding galaxies. Using the Enzo code and a new refinement scheme, FOGGIE
reaches spatial resolutions of 381 comoving $h^{-1}$ pc and resolves extremely
low masses ($\lesssim 1$--$100$ Msun out to 100 comoving $h^{-1}$ kpc from the
central halo. At these resolutions, cloud and filament-like structures giving
rise to simulated absorption are smaller, and better resolved, than the same
structures simulated with standard density-dependent refinement. Most of the
simulated absorption arises in identifiable and well-resolved structures with
masses $\lesssim 10^4$ Msun, well below the mass resolution of typical zoom
simulations. However, integrated quantities such as mass surface density and
ionic covering fractions change at only the $\lesssim 30$% level as resolution
is varied. This relatively small changes in projected quantities---even when
the sizes and distribution of absorbing clouds change dramatically---indicate
that commonly used observables provide only weak constraints on the physical
structure of the underlying gas. Comparing the simulated absorption features to
the KODIAQ (Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorption toward Quasars)

FOGGIE runs better resolve the internal kinematic structure of detected

These results indicate that CGM resolution is key in properly testing

planets below roughly 10 M$_\oplus$ we see a systematic bias of measured masses
that are higher than the true planet mass, regardless of the observing scheme
used. This produces a statistically significant difference in the mass-radius
relation we recover, where planet masses are predicted to be too high and too
similar across the entire super-Earth to Neptune radius range. This bias is due
in part to only reporting masses that are measured with high statistical
significance. Incorporating all mass measurements, even those that are
essentially only upper limits, significantly mitigates this bias. We also find
statistically significant differences between the mean number of planets
measured at the 1-, 3-, and 5$\sigma_{\rm K}$ level by the different

evenly sample the RV phase curves produce a larger number of significant mass

an in quadrature sampling approach. The fourth scheme, out of quadrature,

We explore the formation and evolution of dust rings - now commonly observed in

Earth masses) migrating planets. Through two dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations using gas and dust we find that the importance of perturbations in
the pressure profile interior and exterior to the planet varies for different
particle sizes. For small sizes a dust enhancement occurs interior to the
planet, whereas it is exterior to it for large particles. The transition
between these two behaviours happens when the dust drift velocity is comparable
to the planet migration velocity. We predict that an observational signature of
a migrating planet consists of a significant outwards shift of an observed
midplane dust ring as the wavelength is increased.

plasmons in the presence of Coulomb interactions in isotropic Luttinger
semimetals, for zero as well as generic nonzero temperatures. When the Fermi
level lies right at the QBCP, which is the point where twofold degenerate
conduction and valence bands touch each other quadratically, we find that
plasmons cannot appear at zero temperature. However, for nonzero temperatures,
thermal plasmons are generated. Whether they are long-lived or not depends on
the values of temperature, effective electron mass and effective fine-structure
constant, and the number of fermion flavors. We also numerically estimate the

raises the questions of whether they are mutually compatible and, if so, under

oscillator networks that concurrently exhibit all of these phenomena. The
dynamical units consist of pairs of nonidentical phase oscillators, which we

synchronization in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator
heterogeneity. These networks also exhibit the previously unobserved
possibility of inverted synchronization transitions, in which a transition to a
more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than an increase in the
coupling strength. These various phenomena are shown to emerge under rather
parsimonious conditions, and even in locally connected ring topologies, which
has the potential to facilitate their use to control and manipulate

require use of what might be called `next-to-leading order' LPM results, which
account for quantum interference between consecutive splittings. The complete

conclude therefore that for our fiducial parameters, GRBs, including
low-luminosity bursts, contribute little to none to the UHECR observed. We
further constrain the conditions necessary for an association between UHECR and
llGRBs and find that iron can be accelerated to $10^{20}$ eV in photospheric

given to a small fraction of accelerated electrons. This will necessarily
result in high prompt optical fluxes, and the detection of such a signal could

deep neural networks (DNNs). One form of explanation of the output of a neural
network model in terms of its input features, is a vector of
feature-attributions. Two desirable characteristics of an attribution-based
explanation are: (1) $\textit{sparseness}$: the attributions of irrelevant or
weakly relevant features should be negligible, thus resulting in
$\textit{concise}$ explanations in terms of the significant features, and (2)
$\textit{stability}$: it should not vary significantly within a small local
neighborhood of the input. Our first contribution is a theoretical exploration
of how these two properties (when using attributions based on Integrated
Gradients, or IG) are related to adversarial training, for a class of 1-layer
networks (which includes logistic regression models for binary and multi-class
classification); for these networks we show that (a) adversarial training using
an $\ell_\infty$-bounded adversary produces models with sparse attribution
vectors, and (b) natural model-training while encouraging stable explanations
(via an extra term in the loss function), is equivalent to adversarial
training. Our second contribution is an empirical verification of phenomenon
(a), which we show, somewhat surprisingly, occurs $\textit{not only}$
$\textit{in 1-layer networks}$, $\textit{but also DNNs}$ $\textit{trained on }$
$\textit{standard image datasets}$, and extends beyond IG-based attributions,
to those based on DeepSHAP: adversarial training with $\ell_\infty$-bounded
perturbations yields significantly sparser attribution vectors, with little
degradation in performance on natural test data, compared to natural training.
Moreover, the sparseness of the attribution vectors is significantly better
than that achievable via $\ell_1$-regularized natural training.

dominated by the crossing timescale of a disturbance, e.g., a shock. A larger
fraction of short-term flares are asymmetric with an approximately equal
fraction of longer and shorter decay than rise timescale. We employ the
MUlti-ZOne Radiation Feedback (MUZORF) model to interpret the above results. We
find that the outbursts with slow rise times indicate a gradual acceleration of
the particles to GeV energy. A change in the bulk Lorentz factor of the plasma
or the width of the shocked region can lead to an increase of the cooling time
causing a faster rise than decay time. Parameters such as the luminosity or the
distance of the broad line region (BLR) affects the cooling time strongly if a
single emission mechanism, e.g., external Compton scattering of BLR photons is
considered but may not if other mechanisms, e.g., synchrotron self-compton and
external Compton scattering of the torus photon are included. This work carries
out a systematic study of the symmetry of flares, which can be used to estimate

specification can be relatively difficult. At the same time, prior choice can
have a substantial effect on posterior inferences. Thus, considerations of
robustness need to go hand in hand with nonparametric modeling. In the current
paper, we tackle this challenge by exploiting the fact that variational
Bayesian methods, in addition to having computational advantages in fitting
complex nonparametric models, also yield sensitivities with respect to
parametric and nonparametric aspects of Bayesian models. In particular, we
demonstrate how to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of

Dirichlet process mixtures and related mixture models. We provide both

protoplanetary disks (PPDs) where perturbations excite baroclinic critical
layers, generating ""zombie"" vortices and turbulence. In this work, we
investigate ZVI with nonuniform vertical stratification; while ZVI is triggered
in the stratified regions away from the midplane, the subsequent turbulence
propagates into and fills the midplane. ZVI turbulence alters the background
Keplerian shear flow, creating a steady-state zonal flow. Intermittency is
observed, where the flow cycles through near-laminar phases of zonal flow
punctuated by chaotic bursts of new vortices. ZVI persists in the presence of
radiative damping, as long as the thermal relaxation timescale is more than a
few orbital periods. We refute the premature claim by Lesur & Latter (2016)
that radiative damping inhibits ZVI for disk radii r>0.3 au. Their conclusions
were based on unrealistically short cooling times using opacities with
virtually no grain growth. We explore different grain growth and vertical
settling scenarios, and find that the gas and dust in off-midplane regions are
not necessarily in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with each other. In
such cases, thermal relaxation timescales can be orders of magnitude longer
than the optically thin cooling times assuming LTE because of the finite time
for energy to be exchanged between gas and dust grains via collisions. With
minimal amounts of grain growth and dust settling, the off-midplane regions of
disks are susceptible to ZVI and much of the planet-forming regions can be
filled with zombie vortices and turbulence.

is an important and long standing problem. Researchers commonly appeal to a
turbulent dynamo, sustained by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), to
supply the large-scale field. But research over the last decade in particular
has demonstrated that various non-ideal MHD effects can impede or extinguish
the MRI, especially in protoplanetary disks. In this paper we propose a new
scenario, by which the magnetic field is generated and sustained via the
gravitational instability (GI). We use 3D stratified shearing box simulations
to characterise the dynamo and find that it works at low magnetic Reynolds
number (from unity to ~100) for a wide range of cooling times and boundary
conditions. The process is kinematic, with a relatively fast growth rate ($<
0.1 \Omega$), and it shares some properties of mean field dynamos. The magnetic
field is generated via the combination of differential rotation and spiral
density waves, the latter providing compressible horizontal motions and
large-scale vertical rolls. At greater magnetic Reynolds numbers the build up
of large-scale field is diminished and instead small-scale structures emerge
from the breakdown of twisted flux ropes. We propose that GI may be key to the
dynamo engine not only in young protoplanetary discs but also in some AGN and
galaxies.

consistent with models for a recent, direct collision between the Clouds. We

growth and planet formation. However, the water snowline at the mid-plane
cannot be directly traced by water line observations as the dust emission

Alternatively, the water snowline maybe traced through the sharp changes in
physical properties (surface density and dust size distribution) at this
transition or through the snowlines of other molecules that sublimate
co-spatially with water.
  In this chapter, we discuss the ngVLA's capability of tracing the mid-plane

index caused by changes of dust size distributions and by using the NH3
snowline as a proxy. We found that with the current design of the ngVLA
ability, a sharp transition in spectral index across the water snowline can be
readily traced in relatively bright disks. A detection of the NH3 snowline is
challenging under the current design, but may still be possible if the
NH3-to-water abundance in the disk is close to that of the ISM ices. In
summary, the proposed ngVLA is the only facility can provide sufficient

  application for sea ice deformation",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Arctic sea ice plays an important role in the global climate. Sea ice models
governed by physical equations have been used to simulate the state of the ice
including characteristics such as ice thickness, concentration, and motion.
More recent models also attempt to capture features such as fractures or leads
in the ice. These simulated features can be partially misaligned or misshapen
when compared to observational data, whether due to numerical approximation or
incomplete physics. In order to make realistic forecasts and improve
understanding of the underlying processes, it is necessary to calibrate the
numerical model to field data. Traditional calibration methods based on
generalized least-square metrics are flawed for linear features such as sea ice
cracks. We develop a statistical emulation and calibration framework that
accounts for feature misalignment and misshapenness, which involves optimally
aligning model output with observed features using cutting edge image
registration techniques. This work can also have application to other physical
models which produce coherent structures.

data efficiently generated by the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA). In
seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high
resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic
high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally
challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational
platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and
approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave
packets. Data is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave
equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information
(from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors
not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this
data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API,
GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks,
despite only being trained on FGA data, can detect an interface with a high
success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method.
Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic)
generated using the FGA and a spectral element method. Further, results with a
high accuracy are shown for more complicated geometries including a three
layered model, and a 2D-pocket model where the neural networks trained by both

a reduction of the light amplification of the SGL and to a broadening of its

is important at radio frequencies, where it drastically reduces both the
amplification factor of the SGL and also its angular resolution. However, for

gamma-ray repeaters observed to date have been interpreted as crustal
oscillations caused by a starquake following a dramatic rearrangement of the
stellar magnetic field. Motivated by these observations, we study the influence
of the magnetic field geometry in the frequencies of the torsional oscillations
of magnetized neutron stars. We use realistic tabulated equations of state for
the core and crust of the stars and model their magnetic field as a dipole plus
a toroidal component, using the relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation. The
frequencies of the torsional modes are obtained by the numerical solution of
the eigenvalue problem posed by the linear perturbation equations in the
Cowling approximation. Our results show how the asteroseismology of these stars
becomes complicated by the degeneracy in the frequencies due to the large
relevant parameter space. However, we are able to propose a testable scenario
in which the rearrangement of the magnetic field causes an evolution in the
frequencies. Finally, we show that there is a magnetic field configuration that
maximizes the energy in the perturbation at linear order, which could be
related to the trigger of the giant flare.

develop and validate a universal atrial coordinate system for the following
applications: combination and assessment of multimodal data; comparison of
spatial data across patients; 2D visualization; and construction of patient
specific geometries to test mechanistic hypotheses. Left and right atrial
LGE-MRI data were segmented and meshed. Two coordinates were calculated for
each atrium by solving Laplace's equation, with boundary conditions assigned
using five landmark points. The coordinate system was used to map spatial
information between atrial meshes, including atrial anatomic structures and
fibre directions from a reference geometry. Average error in point transfer
from a source mesh to a destination mesh and back again was less than 6% of the
average mesh element edge length. Scalar mapping from electroanatomic to MRI
geometries was compared to an affine registration technique (mean difference in
bipolar voltage: <10% of voltage range). Patient specific meshes were
constructed using UACs and phase singularity density maps from arrhythmia
simulations were visualised in 2D. We have developed a universal atrial

electroanatomic mapping data, 2D visualisation, and patient specific model

stars are restricted to a relatively thin plane. We examine the accuracy of
applying the Toomre linear stability analysis to predict the location and
amount of gas available for star formation. We find that the Toomre criterion
still works for these irregular galaxies, after correcting for multiple gas and
stellar components: the $Q$ parameter in $\rm{H_2}$ rich regions is in the
range $0.5-1$, remarkably close to unity. Due to the violent stellar feedback
from supernovae and strong turbulent motions, young stars and molecular gas are
not always spatially associated. Neither the $Q$ map nor the $\rm{H_2}$ surface
density map coincide with recent star formation exactly. We argue that the
Toomre criterion is a better indicator of future star formation than a single
$\rm{H_2}$ surface density threshold because of the smaller dynamic range of
$Q$. The depletion time of molecular gas is below 1~Gyr on kpc scale, but with
large scatter. Centering the aperture on density peaks of gas/young stars
systematically biases the depletion time to larger/smaller values and increases
the scatter.

mucus, a complex biological hydrogel, motivating the current study for
synthetic polymeric solutions PEO and HA. The strategy is to identify, and
focus within, a wide range of lag times ${\tau}$ for which passive micron
diameter beads exhibit self-similar (fractional, power law)
mean-squared-displacement (MSD) statistics. For lung mucus, PEO at three
different molecular weights (Mw), and HA at one Mw, we find ensemble-averaged
MSDs of the form ${\langle}{\Delta}r^{2}({\tau}){\rangle} =
4D_{\alpha}{\tau}^{\alpha}$, all within a common band, [1/60 sec, 3 sec], of
lag times ${\tau}$. We employ the MSD power law parameters
$(D_{\alpha},{\alpha})$ to classify each polymeric solution over a range of
highly entangled concentrations. By the generalized Stokes-Einstein relation,
power law MSD implies power law elastic $G'({\omega})$ and viscous
$G''({\omega})$ moduli for frequencies $1/{\tau}$, [0.33 sec$^{-1}$, 60
sec$^{-1}$]. A natural question surrounds the polymeric properties that dictate
$D_{\alpha}$ and ${\alpha}$, e.g. polymer concentration c, Mw, and stiffness
(persistence length). In [Hill et al., PLOS ONE (2014)], we showed the MSD
exponent ${\alpha}$ varies linearly, while the pre-factor $D_{\alpha}$ varies
exponentially, with concentration, i.e. the semi-log plot,
$(log(D_{\alpha}),{\alpha})(c)$ of the classifier data is collinear. Here we
show the same result for three distinct Mw PEO and HA at a single Mw. Future
studies are required to explore the generality of these results for polymeric
solutions, and to understand this scaling behavior with polymer concentration.

significant amount of attention both from researchers and industry. Numerous
studies targeting algorithms, software frameworks, and applications on the CAVs

edge computing system and architecture design for the CAVs scenario and
provided various heterogeneous platform prototypes for CAVs. However, a
standard and comprehensive application benchmark for CAVs is missing, hindering
the study of these emerging computing systems. To address this challenging
problem, we present CAVBench, the first benchmark suite for the edge computing
system in the CAVs scenario. CAVBench is comprised of six typical applications
covering four dominate CAVs scenarios and takes four datasets as standard
input. CAVBench provides quantitative evaluation results via application and
system perspective output metrics. We perform a series of experiments and
acquire three systemic characteristics of the applications in CAVBench. First,
the operation intensity of the applications is polarized, which explains why
heterogeneous hardware is important for a CAVs computing system. Second, all
applications in CAVBench consume high memory bandwidth, so the system should be
equipped with high bandwidth memory or leverage good memory bandwidth
management to avoid the performance degradation caused by memory bandwidth
competition. Third, some applications have worse data/instruction locality
based on the cache miss observation, so the computing system targeting these
applications should optimize the cache architecture. Last, we use the CAVBench
to evaluate a typical edge computing platform and present the quantitative and
qualitative analysis of the benchmarking results.

We recover the results of numerical simulations for $f(R)$-gravity models and
present new results for K-mouflage scenarios. We find that the shape of the
distortion due to the modified gravity depends on the model, through the
scale-dependence or not of their growth rate. This is more clearly seen in the
three-dimensional power spectrum than in the one-dimensional power spectrum,
where the line-of-sight integration smoothes the deviation. Whilst the
Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectrum does not provide competitive bounds for $f(R)$
theories, it could provide useful constraints for the K-mouflage models. Thus,
the efficiency of the Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectrum as a probe of
modified-gravity scenarios depends on the type of screening mechanism and the
related scale dependence it induces. The prospect of a full recovery of the
three-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectrum from data would also lead to
stronger constraints and a better understanding of screening mechanisms.

Bayesian Linear Regression (wBLR) to model the unknown dynamics, and show how
this simple model is more accurate in both its estimate of the mean behaviour

operating conditions with little or no tuning. In addition, wBLR allows us to
use fast adaptation and long-term learning in one, unified framework, to adapt
quickly to new operating conditions and learn repetitive model errors over

look-ahead, and easier optimization when the model is used in a stochastic
Model Predictive Controller (MPC). In order to fully capitalize on the long

and the deaths of most stars in the Universe that evolve in a Hubble time could
be fundamentally affected by such interactions. These stars end their lives,
evolving from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars with extensive mass-loss into
planetary nebulae with a spectacular array of morphologies. Binarity, and the
associated formation of accretion disks (that drive collimated, fast jets)
during the very late AGB or early post-AGB phase is believed to produce this
dramatic morphological transformation. But the evidence for binarity and
accretion during the AGB phase has been hard to obtain due to observational
limitations. However, recent observations at UV and X-ray wavelengths have
broken thru the observational barrier -- our studies using GALEX reveal a
candidate population of AGB stars, generally with strongly-variable
far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission (fuvAGB stars), and our follow-up studies with
XMM-Newton, Chandra, and HST of a few key objects supports our hypothesis that
these objects have companions that are actively accreting material from the
primary. The most prominent fuvAGB star has been detected with the VLA, showing
the presence of variable non-thermal emission. The ngVLA, with its
unprecedented sensitivity, is needed to survey a statistical sample of fuvAGB
stars over the ~3-90 Ghz range to search for and characterize the nature of the
radio emission from fuvAGB stars and test our binarity+accretion hypothesis.
Such a survey will distinguish between binarity/accretion-related radio
emission that is expected to have both thermal and non-thermal components and
display significantly time-variable on short time-scales (minutes to weeks),
and single-star chromospheric emission from the primary that is expected to be
thermal, possibly with time-variability, but only on long time-scales (many
months to a year).

recent theoretical studies have indicated that it may play an unexpected and

predicts that disorder might play a role in driving a Mott insulator across an
IMT, with the emergent metallic state hosting a power law suppression of the
density of states (with exponent close to 1; V-shaped gap) centered at the
Fermi energy. Such V-shaped gaps have been observed in Mott systems but their
origins are as yet unknown. To investigate this, we use scanning tunneling

antiferromagnetic, metallic state. Our experiments reveal that many core
features of the IMT such as power law density of states, pinning of the Fermi

understood as universal features of a disordered Mott system near an IMT and
suggest that V-shaped gaps may be an inevitable consequence of disorder in

sectors of the population will select aggressive incentives, leaving value on
the table for those who don't opt in. In a field experiment conducted over a 29
week period on individuals wearing Fitbit activity trackers, we find modest and
short lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of
aggressive incentives. In contrast, we find significant and persistent
increases for those assigned (oftentimes against their stated preference) to

seems to emerge because those who benefited most from the aggressive incentives

also find that benefits to individuals assigned to aggressive incentives were
pronounced if they also updated their step target in the Fitbit mobile

important implications for incentive based interventions to improve health

drift distance along the length of the filter, the filter zooms in with
exponentially increasing precision on the transverse velocity component of the

length that is exceptionally compact compared to previous techniques for
electromagnetic filtering. The parallel velocity component of the electron
kinetic energy oscillates in an electrostatic harmonic trap as the electron

overcomes three limitations of existing matching approaches. First, it directly
balances covariates with multi-valued treatments without requiring the

that are representative of a target population by design. Third, it can handle
large data sets, with hundreds of thousands of observations, in a couple of

treatment groups relative to a target population and positing a linear-sized
mixed integer formulation of the matching problem. We formally show that this
formulation is more effective than alternative quadratic-sized formulations, as
its reduction in size does not affect its strength from the standpoint of its
linear programming relaxation. We also show that this formulation can be used
for matching with distributional covariate balance in polynomial time under
certain assumptions on the covariates and that it can handle large data sets in
practice even when the assumptions are not satisfied. This algorithmic
characterization is key to handle large data sets. We illustrate this new
approach to matching in both a simulation study and an observational study of
the impact of an earthquake on educational attainment. After matching, the
results can be visualized with simple and transparent graphical displays: while
increasing levels of exposure to the earthquake have a negative impact on
school attendance, there is no effect on college admission test scores.

convergence towards a global optimum (i.e., a saddle point in the corresponding

in faster convergence speeds, while allowing for a fully distributed

illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in a distributed signal

invalid regions of the input space can be an interesting source of erroneous
inputs. Knowing where a specific software under test (SUT) has a boundary is
essential for validation in relation to requirements. However, finding where a
SUT actually implements the boundary is a non-trivial problem that has not
gotten much attention. This paper proposes a method of finding the boundary
between the valid and invalid regions of the input space. The proposed method
consists of two steps. First, test data generators, directed by a search
algorithm to maximise distance to known, valid test cases, generate valid test
cases that are closer to the boundary. Second, these valid test cases undergo
mutations to try to push them over the boundary and into the invalid part of
the input space. This results in a pair of test sets, one consisting of test
cases on the valid side of the boundary and a matched set on the outer side,
with only a small distance between the two sets. The method is evaluated on a
number of examples from the standard library of a modern programming language.
We propose a method of determining the boundary between valid and invalid
regions of the input space and apply it on a SUT that has a non-contiguous
valid region of the input space. From the small distance between the developed
pairs of test sets, and the fact that one test set contains valid test cases
and the other invalid test cases, we conclude that the pair of test sets
described the boundary between the valid and invalid regions of that input
space. Differences of behaviour can be observed between different distances and
sets of mutation operators, but all show that the method is able to identify
the boundary between the valid and invalid regions of the input space. This is
an important step towards more automated robustness testing.

this approach may be prone to overfitting and sensitive to noise. To address
these challenges we instead seek a sparse representation of the data in a
library of examples. Sparse representation has been widely used for image
recognition and reconstruction, and it is well-suited to structured data with
limited, corrupt measurements. We explore sparse representation for flow
reconstruction on a variety of fluid data sets with a wide range of complexity,
including vortex shedding past a cylinder at low Reynolds number, a mixing
layer, and two geophysical flows. In addition, we compare several measurement
strategies and consider various types of noise and corruption over a range of
intensities. We find that sparse representation has considerably improved
estimation accuracy and robustness to noise and corruption compared with least
squares methods. We also introduce a sparse estimation procedure on local
spatial patches for complex multiscale flows that preclude a global sparse
representation. Based on these results, sparse representation is a promising
framework for extracting useful information from complex flow fields with

veil the midplane, low intrinsic molecular abundances due to efficient
freeze-out, and, in the case of mid-sized organics, a mismatch between expected
excitation temperatures and accessible line upper energy levels. At ngVLA
wavelengths, the dust is optically thin, enabling observations into the planet
forming disk midplane. ngVLA also has the requisite sensitivity. Using TW Hya

Function Virtualization (NFV), large-scale NFV infrastructure deployments are
gaining momentum. Such infrastructures are home to thousands of network Service
Function Chains (SFCs), each composed of a chain of virtual network functions
(VNFs) that are processing incoming traffic flows. Unfortunately, in such
environments, the failure of a single node may break down several VNFs and
thereby breaking many service chains at the same time.
  In this paper, we address this particular problem and investigate possible
solutions to ensure the survivability of the affected service chains by
provisioning backup VNFs that can take over in case of failure. Specifically,
we propose a survivability management framework to efficiently manage SFCs and
the backup VNFs. We formulate the SFC survivability problem as an integer
linear program that determines the minimum number of required backups to
protect all the SFCs in the system and identifies their optimal placement in
the infrastructure. We also propose two heuristic algorithms to cope with the
large-scale instances of the problem. Through extensive simulations of
different deployment scenarios, we show that these algorithms provide
near-optimal solutions with minimal computation time.

of flux emergence and transport on Sun-like stars, to simulate stellar
brightness variations for various levels of magnetic activity and rotation
rates. Assuming that the distribution of magnetic flux at the base of the
convection zone follows solar scaling relations, we calculate the emergence
latitudes and tilt angles of bipolar regions at the surface for various
rotation rates, using thin-flux-tube simulations. Taking these two quantities
as input to a surface flux transport SFT model, we simulate the
diffusive-advective evolution of the radial field at the stellar surface,
including effects of active region nesting. As the rotation rate increases, (1)
magnetic flux emerges at higher latitudes and an inactive gap opens around the
equator, reaching a half-width of $20^\circ$ for $8\Omega_\odot$, (2) the tilt
angles of freshly emerged bipolar regions show stronger variations with
latitude. Polar spots can form at $8\Omega_\odot$ by accumulation of
follower-polarity flux from decaying bipolar regions. From $4\Omega_\odot$ to
$8\Omega_\odot$, the maximum spot coverage changes from 3 to 20%, respectively,
compared to 0.4% for the solar model. Nesting of activity can lead to strongly
non-axisymmetric spot distributions. On Sun-like stars rotating at
$8\Omega_\odot$ ($P_{\rm rot}\simeq 3$ days), polar spots can form, owing to
higher levels of flux emergence rate and tilt angles. Defining spots by a
threshold field strength yields global spot coverages that are roughly
consistent with stellar observations.

a bistable potential barrier that creates a threshold, the input of the system

experiencing different relativistic effects is an important milestone in future
research at the interface of gravity and quantum mechanics. This could be
achieved by generating a superposition of quantum clocks that follow paths with
different gravitational time dilation and investigating the consequences on the
interference signal when they are eventually recombined. Light-pulse atom
interferometry with elements employed in optical atomic clocks is a promising
candidate for that purpose, but suffers from major challenges including its
insensitivity to the gravitational redshift in a uniform field. All these
difficulties can be overcome with a novel scheme presented here which is based
on initializing the clock when the spatially separate superposition has already
been generated and performing a doubly differential measurement where the
differential phase shift between the two internal states is compared for
different initialization times. This can be exploited to test the universality
of the gravitational redshift with delocalized coherent superpositions of
quantum clocks and it is argued that its experimental implementation should be
feasible with a new generation of 10-meter atomic fountains that will soon
become available. Interestingly, the approach also offers significant
advantages for more compact set-ups based on guided interferometry or hybrid
configurations. Furthermore, in order to provide a solid foundation for the
analysis of the various interferometry schemes and the effects that can be
measured with them, a general formalism for a relativistic description of atom
interferometry in curved spacetime is developed. It can deal with freely
falling atoms, but also include the effects of external forces and guiding
potentials, and can be applied to a very wide range of situations.

assess the extent to which the mass media's reporting of Euroscepticism
indicates the Europeanization of public spheres. Using a mixed-methods approach
combining LDA topic modeling and qualitative coding, we find that approximately
70 per cent of print articles mentioning ""Euroscepticism"" or ""Eurosceptic"" are
framed in a non-domestic (i.e. European) context. In five of the six cases
studied, articles exhibiting a European context are strikingly similar in
content, with the British case as the exception. However, coverage of British
Euroscepticism drives Europeanization in other Member States. Bivariate
logistic regressions further reveal three macro-level structural variables that
significantly correlate with a Europeanized media discourse: newspaper type

relationship to the EU budget (net contributor or receiver of EU funds).

artificial multisensory perception remains an open issue especially in
situations of sensory uncertainty and conflicts. In this work, we extend
previous studies on audio-visual (AV) conflict resolution in complex
environments. In particular, we focus on quantitatively assessing the
contribution of semantic congruency during an AV spatial localization task. In
addition to conflicts in the spatial domain (i.e. spatially misaligned
stimuli), we consider gender-specific conflicts with male and female avatars.
Our results suggest that while semantically related stimuli affect the
magnitude of the visual bias (perceptually shifting the location of the sound
towards a semantically congruent visual cue), humans still strongly rely on
environmental statistics to solve AV conflicts. Together with previously
reported results, this work contributes to a better understanding of how
multisensory integration and conflict resolution can be modelled in artificial

kernel methods are usually not feasible for regression anymore. Besides simple

discretizations of larger (kernel) model classes lead to algorithms, which
naturally scale linearly in the amount of data points. For moderate-dimensional
or high-dimensional regression tasks, these grid-based discretizations suffer
from the curse of dimensionality. Here, sparse grid methods have proven to
circumvent this problem to a large extent. In this context, space- and

successful. They nevertheless rely on an axis-aligned structure of the solution

generally the \emph{Surface Order}. This provides a way of associating to every
algebraic curve $X$, with function field $k(X)$ (defined over an arbitrary

over Surface Orders, which are defined as pullbacks of certain matrix algebras
over commutative $k$-algebras. We will then be able to prove that the center
and the (noncommutative) normalization of the surface orders are invariant
under the action of the absolute Galois group
$\mathcal{G}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$. We will see that the surface
algebras and surface orders are closely related to the fundamental group(oid)
of the Riemann surfaces and the associated monodromy group. A description of
the projective resolutions of the simple modules over the surface order is
given and it will be shown that one can completely recover the dessin with the
projective resolutions of the simple modules alone. In particular, the
projective resolutions of the simple modules encode all combinatorial and
topological data of the monodromy group (or cartographic group) of a dessin.
Finally, as a corollary we are able to say that classifying dessins in an orbit

learning applications, in particular when dealing with human outcomes, e.g.
inviting or not inviting for a job interview based on application materials
that may include photographs. One promising direction to achieve fairness is by
learning data representations that remove the semantics of protected
characteristics, and are therefore able to mitigate unfair outcomes. All
available models however learn latent embeddings which comes at the cost of
being uninterpretable. We propose to cast this problem as data-to-data
translation, i.e. learning a mapping from an input domain to a fair target
domain, where a fairness definition is being enforced. Here the data domain can
be images, or any tabular data representation. This task would be
straightforward if we had fair target data available, but this is not the case.
To overcome this, we learn a highly unconstrained mapping by exploiting
statistics of residuals - the difference between input data and its translated
version - and the protected characteristics. When applied to the CelebA dataset
of face images with gender attribute as the protected characteristic, our model
enforces equality of opportunity by adjusting the eyes and lips regions.
Intriguingly, on the same dataset we arrive at similar conclusions when using
semantic attribute representations of images for translation. On face images of
the recent DiF dataset, with the same gender attribute, our method adjusts nose
regions. In the Adult income dataset, also with protected gender attribute, our
model achieves equality of opportunity by, among others, obfuscating the wife
and husband relationship. Analyzing those systematic changes will allow us to
scrutinize the interplay of fairness criterion, chosen protected
characteristics, and prediction performance.

previously developed and verified as an efficient solver for high-frequency
acoustic wave propagation (P-wave). The main contribution of this paper
consists of three aspects: 1. We derive the FGA formulation for the 3-D elastic
wave equation. Rather than standard ray-based methods (e.g. geometric optics
and Gaussian beam method), the derivation requires to do asymptotic expansion
in the week sense (integral form) so that one is able to perform integration by
parts. Compared to the FGA theory for acoustic wave equation, the calculations
in the derivation are much more technically involved due to the existence of
both P- and S-waves, and the coupling of the polarized directions for SH- and
SV-waves. In particular, we obtain the diabatic coupling terms for SH- and
SV-waves, with the form closely connecting to the concept of Berry phase that
is intensively studied in quantum mechanics and topology (Chern number). The
accuracy and parallelizability of the FGA algorithm is illustrated by comparing
to the spectral element method for 3-D elastic wave equation in homogeneous
media; 2. We derive the interface conditions of FGA for 3-D elastic wave
equation based on an Eulerian formulation and the Snell's law. We verify these
conditions by simulating high-frequency elastic wave propagation in a 1-D
layered Earth model. In this example, we also show that it is natural to apply
the FGA algorithm to geometries with non-Cartesian coordinates; 3. We apply the
developed FGA algorithm for 3-D seismic { wave-equation-based traveltime

permeability materials such as MnF$_2$ and FeF$_2$ to strongly enhance
spin-relaxation in nearby emitters in the THz spectral range. We find that
these magnetic polaritons in 100 nm thin-films can be confined to lengths over
10,000 times smaller than the wavelength of a photon at the same frequency,
allowing for a surprising twelve orders of magnitude enhancement in magnetic
dipole transitions. This takes THz spin-flip transitions, which normally occur
at timescales on the order of a year, and forces them to occur at sub-ms
timescales. Our results suggest an interesting platform for polaritonics at THz
frequencies, and more broadly, a new way to use polaritons to control
light-matter interactions.

Medical data can be in the form of tabular structures (i.e. tables), free-form
narratives, and images. This study focuses on medical data in the free form
longitudinal text. De-identification of electronic health records provides the
opportunity to use such data for research without it affecting patient privacy,
and avoids the need for individual patient consent. In recent years there is
increasing interest in developing an accurate, robust and adaptable automatic
de-identification system for electronic health records. This is mainly due to
the dilemma between the availability of an abundance of health data, and the
inability to use such data in research due to legal and ethical restrictions.
De-identification tracks in competitions such as the 2014 i2b2 UTHealth and the
2016 CEGS N-GRID shared tasks have provided a great platform to advance this
area. The primary reasons for this include the open source nature of the
dataset and the fact that raw psychiatric data were used for 2016 competitions.
This study focuses on noticeable trend changes in the techniques used in the
development of automatic de-identification for longitudinal clinical
narratives. More specifically, the shift from using conditional random fields

representations for nodes in a network, where each node contains rich
attributes/features describing node content. Because network topology structure

attribute proximity into network embedding is beneficial for learning good
vector representations. In reality, large-scale networks often have
incomplete/missing node content or linkages, yet existing attributed network
embedding algorithms all operate under the assumption that networks are
complete. Thus, their performance is vulnerable to missing data and suffers
from poor scalability.
  In this paper, we propose a Scalable Incomplete Network Embedding (SINE)
algorithm for learning node representations from incomplete graphs. SINE
formulates a probabilistic learning framework that separately models pairs of
node-context and node-attribute relationships. Different from existing
attributed network embedding algorithms, SINE provides greater flexibility to
make the best of useful information and mitigate negative effects of missing
information on representation learning. A stochastic gradient descent based
online algorithm is derived to learn node representations, allowing SINE to
scale up to large-scale networks with high learning efficiency. We evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency of SINE through extensive experiments on
real-world networks. Experimental results confirm that SINE outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in various tasks, including node classification,
node clustering, and link prediction, under settings with missing links and

resistivity on MoS2 and SiO2, we demonstrated that two-dimensional MoS2 can be
used to enhance the electrical performance of ultrathin Cu films due to a
partial specular surface scattering. By fitting the experimental data with the
theoretical Fuchs Sondheimer model, we obtained the specularity parameter at
the Cu MoS2 interface in the temperature range 2K to 300K. Furthermore, first
principle calculations based on the density functional theory indicates that
there are more localized states at the Cu amorphous SiO2 interface than the Cu
MoS2 interface which is responsible for the higher resistivity in the Cu SiO2
heterostructure due to more severe electron scattering. Our results suggest
that Cu MoS2 hybrid is a promising candidate structure for the future

the framework of the interacting boson model of nuclei. It involves a
construction of a number-conserving Hamiltonian which preserves the dynamical
symmetry of selected bands associated with each shape, while breaking the
symmetries in other states. The resulting structure embodies multiple partial
dynamical symmetries. The procedure is applied to prolate-oblate and
spherical-prolate-oblate coexistence, at and slightly away from the critical
points.

boundary data for second order operators with complex coefficients in domains
with lower dimensional boundaries, e.g., in $\Omega := \mathbb R^n \setminus
\mathbb R^d$ with $d<n-1$. Following the first results of Guy David and the two
first authors, the article introduces an appropriate degenerate elliptic
operator and show that the Dirichlet problem is solvable for all $q>1$ provided
that the coefficients satisfy the small Carleson norm condition.
  Even in the context of the classical case $d=n-1$, (the analogues of) our
results are new. The conditions on the coefficients are more relaxed than the
previously known ones (most notably, we do not impose any restrictions
whatsoever on the first $n-1$ rows of the matrix of coefficients) and the
results are more general. We establish local rather than global estimates
between the square function and the non-tangential maximal function and,
perhaps even more importantly, we establish new Moser-type estimates at the
boundary and improve the interior ones.

  Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO), 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.AR cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The past several years have seen both an explosion in the use of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the design of accelerators to make CNN
inference practical. In the architecture community, the lion share of effort
has targeted CNN inference for image recognition. The closely related problem
of video recognition has received far less attention as an accelerator target.
This is surprising, as video recognition is more computationally intensive than
image recognition, and video traffic is predicted to be the majority of
internet traffic in the coming years.
  This paper fills the gap between algorithmic and hardware advances for video
recognition by providing a design space exploration and flexible architecture
for accelerating 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) - the core kernel
in modern video understanding. When compared to (2D) CNNs used for image
recognition, efficiently accelerating 3D CNNs poses a significant engineering
challenge due to their large (and variable over time) memory footprint and
higher dimensionality.
  To address these challenges, we design a novel accelerator, called Morph,
that can adaptively support different spatial and temporal tiling strategies
depending on the needs of each layer of each target 3D CNN. We codesign a
software infrastructure alongside the Morph hardware to find good-fit
parameters to control the hardware. Evaluated on state-of-the-art 3D CNNs,
Morph achieves up to 3.4x (2.5x average) reduction in energy consumption and
improves performance/watt by up to 5.1x (4x average) compared to a baseline 3D
CNN accelerator, with an area overhead of 5%. Morph further achieves a 15.9x
average energy reduction on 3D CNNs when compared to Eyeriss.

levels of lethality, depending on their roles in metabolism and the size of
subsequent cascades induced by their failure. Moreover, essentiality of
individual metabolic reactions may show large variations within and across
species. Here we quantify their essentialities in hundreds of species by
computing the growth rate after removal of individual and pairs of reactions by
flux balance analysis. We find that about 10% of reactions are essential, i.e.,
growth stops without them, and most of the remaining reactions are redundant in
the metabolic network of each species. This large-scale and cross-species study
allows us to determine ad hoc ages of each reaction and species. We find that
when a reaction is older and contained in younger species, the reaction is more
likely to be essential. Such correlations of essentiality with the ages of
reactions and species may be attributable to the evolution of cellular
metabolism, in which alternative pathways are recruited to ensure the stability
of important reactions to various degrees across species.

applications, ranging from social networks mining, bioinformatics. In this
paper, we focus on mining dense subgraphs in a bipartite graph. The work is
motivated by the task of detecting synchronized behavior that can often be
formulated as mining a bipartite graph formed by the source nodes (followers,
customers) and target nodes (followees, products, etc.) for malicious patterns.
We introduce a new restricted biclique problem, Maximal Half Isolated Biclique
(MHI Biclique), and show that the problem finds immediate applications in fraud
detection. We prove that, unlike many other biclique problems such as the
maximum edge biclique problem that are known to be NP-Complete, the MHI
Biclique problem admits a linear time solution. We provide a novel algorithm
S-tree, and its extension, S-forest, that solves the problem efficiently. We
also demonstrate that the algorithms are robust against deliberate camouflaging
and other perturbations. Furthermore, our approach can automatically combine
and prioritize multiple features, reducing the need for feature engineering
while maintaining security against unseen attacks. Extensive experiments on
several public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that S-tree/S-forest
outperforms strong rivals across all configurations, becoming the new state of
the art in fraud detection.

protein to a specific site on the DNA. The strategy adopted by a protein,
called transcription factor (TF), for searching its specific binding site on
the DNA has been investigated over several decades. In recent times the effects
obstacles, like DNA-binding proteins, on the search by TF has begun to receive
attention. RNA polymerase (RNAP) motors collectively move along a segment of
the DNA during a genomic process called transcription. This RNAP traffic is
bound to affect the diffusive scanning of the same segment of the DNA by a TF
searching for its binding site. Motivated by this phenomenon, here we develop a
kinetic model where a `particle', that represents a TF, searches for a specific
site on a one-dimensional lattice. On the same lattice another species of
particles, each representing a RNAP, hop from left to right exactly as in a
totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) which forbids simultaneous
occupation of any site by more than one particle, irrespective of their
identities. Although the TF is allowed to attach to or detach from any lattice
site, the RNAPs can attach only to the first site at the left edge and detach
from only the last site on the right edge of the lattice. We formulate the
search as a {\it first-passage} process; the time taken to reach the target
site {\it for the first time}, starting from a well defined initial state, is
the search time. By approximate analytical calculations and Monte Carlo (MC)
computer simulations, we calculate the mean search time. We show that RNAP
traffic rectifies the diffusive motion of TF to that of a Brownian ratchet, and
the mean time of successful search can be even shorter than that required in
the absence of RNAP traffic. Moreover, we show that there is an optimal rate of
detachment that corresponds to the shortest mean search time.

applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with
positive and negative weights are separately performed in each layer and
summation results are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction
operation. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to
implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current
mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in
charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be
designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low
power consumption. However, they have to use very high resistance devices on
the order of G$\rm \Omega$. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS VLSI chip
to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights and evaluated it by
post-layout circuit simulation using 250-nm fabrication technology. High
resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of
MOS transistors. Simulation results showed that energy efficiency for the
weighted-sum calculation was 290~TOPS/W, more than one order of magnitude
higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even though the
minimum width of interconnection used in the PoC chip was several times larger
than that in such digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is
used to implement the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than
1,000~TOPS/W will be possible. For practical applications, development of
emerging analog memory devices such as ferroelectric-gate FETs is necessary.

algorithm for processing large sparse data. The algorithm has similar accuracy
to the basic randomized SVD (rPCA) algorithm (Halko et al., 2011), but is
largely optimized for sparse data. It also has good flexibility to trade off
runtime against accuracy for practical usage. Experiments on real data show
that the proposed algorithm is up to 9.1X faster than the basic rPCA algorithm
without accuracy loss, and is up to 20X faster than the svds in Matlab with
little error. The algorithm computes the first 100 principal components of a
large information retrieval data with 12,869,521 persons and 323,899 keywords
in less than 400 seconds on a 24-core machine, while all conventional methods

(IVR) systems, using speech technology for development, people's experiences
with intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) and how user memory affects speech

protocols that employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for
heterogeneous wireless networking, referred to as carrier-sense
deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (CS-DLMA). Existing CSMA protocols,
such as the medium access control (MAC) of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous
network environment in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols
suffer from severe performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where
there are nodes adopting other MAC protocols. This paper shows that DRL
techniques can be used to design efficient MAC protocols for heterogeneous
networking. In particular, in a heterogeneous environment with nodes adopting
different MAC protocols (e.g., CS-DLMA, TDMA, and ALOHA), a CS-DLMA node can
learn to maximize the sum throughput of all nodes. Furthermore, compared with
WiFi's CSMA, CS-DLMA can achieve both higher sum throughput and individual
throughputs when coexisting with other MAC protocols. Last but not least, a
salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it does not need to know the operating
mechanisms of the co-existing MACs. Neither does it need to know the number of
nodes using these other MACs.

dynamics, which do not depend on time explicitly, we show that the Fisher

different decoding schemes, two kinds of decoding strategies are proposed:
\emph{single signal decoding scheme} and \emph{MRC decoding scheme},
respectively. For the \emph{single signal decoding scheme}, the users
immediately decode the received signals after receptions from the BS.
Meanwhile, for the \emph{MRC decoding scheme}, instead of decoding, the users
will keep the receptions in reserve until the corresponding phase comes and the
users jointly decode the received signals by employing maximum ratio combining
(MRC). Considering Rayleigh fading channels, the ergodic sum-rate (SR), outage
probability and outage capacity of the proposed D2D-NOMA system are analyzed.
Moreover, approximate expressions for the ergodic SR are also provided with a
negligible performance loss. Numerical results demonstrate that the ergodic SR
and outage probability of the proposed D2D-NOMA scheme overwhelm that of the
conventional NOMA schemes. Furthermore, it is also revealed that the system
performance including the ergodic SR and outage probability are limited by the
poor channel condition for both the \emph{single signal decoding scheme} and

that, in the limit of infinite sample size, the excess risk has a chi-square
type distribution, even in the misspecified case. We demonstrate how
self-concordance of the loss allows to characterize the critical sample size
sufficient to guarantee a chi-square type in-probability bound for the excess
risk. Specifically, we consider two classes of losses: (i) self-concordant
losses in the classical sense of Nesterov and Nemirovski, i.e., whose third
derivative is uniformly bounded with the $3/2$ power of the second derivative;
(ii) pseudo self-concordant losses, for which the power is removed. These
classes contain losses corresponding to several generalized linear models,
including the logistic loss and pseudo-Huber losses. Our basic result under
minimal assumptions bounds the critical sample size by $O(d \cdot
d_{\text{eff}}),$ where $d$ the parameter dimension and $d_{\text{eff}}$ the
effective dimension that accounts for model misspecification. In contrast to
the existing results, we only impose local assumptions that concern the
population risk minimizer $\theta_*$. Namely, we assume that the calibrated
design, i.e., design scaled by the square root of the second derivative of the
loss, is subgaussian at $\theta_*$. Besides, for type-ii losses we require
boundedness of a certain measure of curvature of the population risk at
$\theta_*$.Our improved result bounds the critical sample size from above as
$O(\max\{d_{\text{eff}}, d \log d\})$ under slightly stronger assumptions.
Namely, the local assumptions must hold in the neighborhood of $\theta_*$ given
by the Dikin ellipsoid of the population risk. Interestingly, we find that, for
logistic regression with Gaussian design, there is no actual restriction of
conditions: the subgaussian parameter and curvature measure remain
near-constant over the Dikin ellipsoid. Finally, we extend some of these
results to $\ell_1$-penalized estimators in high dimensions.

spin-glass phase in SrMn1-xWxO3 (x=0.20 to 0.40) have been studied using
neutron powder diffraction (NPD), muon spin relaxation (MuSR), and magnetic
susceptibility (X) measurements. Structural studies reveal that SrMn1-xWxO3
undergoes a quasi-continuous transformation from simple perovskite (Pm-3m) to
PODP (P21/n) phase as x increases. Xdc(T) and Xac(T) measurements show a sharp
cusp-like peak at a spin glass transition, Tg. The muon relaxation rate
({\lambda}) peaks at Tg following a critical growth, given by
{\lambda}={\lambda}(0).t-w [t=(T-Tg)/Tg]. However, no long-range magnetic order
is observed in NPD below Tg. These measurements confirm a tunable spin-glass
freezing in SrMn1-xWxO3 with Tg monotonously decreasing with W content, which
we attribute to tuning the relative concentration of the coexisting Mn-O-Mn and
Mn-O-W-O-Mn anti-ferromagnetic super-exchange pathways altering the geometric
frustration.

separation problems that turned out to be important in parameterized
complexity: Skew Multicut and Directed Feedback Arc Set. In our generalization,
we assign colors $1,2,...,\ell$ to some edges and give separate budgets
$k_{1},k_{2},...,k_{\ell}$. Let $E_{i}$ be the set of edges of color $i$. The
solution $C$ for the multi-budgeted variant of a graph separation problem not
only needs to satisfy the usual separation requirements, but also needs to
satisfy that $|C\cap E_{i}|\leq k_{i}$ for every $i\in \{1,...,\ell\}$.
  Contrary to the classic minimum cut problem, the multi-budgeted variant turns
out to be NP-hard even for $\ell = 2$. We propose FPT algorithms parameterized
by $k=k_{1}+...+k_{\ell}$ for all three problems. To this end, we develop a
branching procedure for the multi-budgeted minimum cut problem that measures
the progress of the algorithm not by reducing $k$ as usual, by but elevating
the capacity of some edges and thus increasing the size of maximum
source-to-sink flow. Using the fact that a similar strategy is used to
enumerate all important separators of a given size, we merge this process with
the flow-guided branching and show an FPT bound on the number of (appropriately
defined) important multi-budgeted separators. This allows us to extend our
algorithm to the Skew Multicut and Directed Feedback Arc Set problems.
  Furthermore, we show connections of the multi-budgeted variants with weighted
variants of the directed cut problems and the Chain $\ell$-SAT problem, whose
parameterized complexity remains an open problem. We show that these problems
admit a bounded-in-parameter number of ""maximally pushed"" solutions (in a
similar spirit as important separators are maximally pushed), giving somewhat
weak evidence towards their tractability.

question of how `treelike' a phylogenetic network is has become the center of
attention in various studies. This led to the introduction of \emph{tree-based

geometry between a two-dimensional plane and a complete three-dimensional
lattice with an open boundary in the direction of the growing thickness. We
perform a multi-fractal analysis of the Barkhausen noise signals and scaling of
the critical avalanches of the domain wall motion. Our results reveal that, for
sufficiently small thickness, the sample geometry profoundly affects the
dynamics by modifying the spectral segments that represent small fluctuations
and promoting the time-scale dependent multi-fractality. Meanwhile, the
avalanche distributions display two distinct power-law regions, in contrast to
those in the two-dimensional limit, and the average avalanche shapes are
asymmetric. With increasing thickness, the scaling characteristics and the
multi-fractal spectrum in thicker samples gradually approach the hysteresis
loop criticality in three-dimensional systems. Thin ferromagnetic films are
growing in importance technologically, and our results illustrate some new

three distinct phases, superconductor, superinsulator and bosonic topological
insulator. The superinsulator is a state of matter with infinite resistance in
a finite temperature range, which is the S-dual of the superconductor and in
which charge transport is prevented by electric strings binding charges of
opposite sign. The electric strings ensuring linear confinement of charges are
generated by instantons and are dual to superconducting Abrikosov vortices.
Material parameters and disorder enter the London penetration depth of the
superconductor, the string tension of the superinsulator and the quantum
fluctuation parameter driving the transition between them. They are entirely
encoded in four phenomenological parameters of a topological gauge theory of
the SIT. Finally, we point out that, in the context of strong coupling gauge
theories, the many-body localization phenomenon that is often referred to as an
underlying mechanism for superinsulation is a mere transcription of the
well-known phenomenon of confinement into solid state physics language and is
entirely driven by endogenous disorder embodied by instantons with no need of

of the solution, and the principles of residual distribution schemes are
adapted to obtain steady state solutions. Extensive numerical examples in both
scalar and system test problems in one and two dimensions demonstrate the
efficiency, high order accuracy and the capability of resolving shocks of the
proposed methods.

event with extremely high intensity-had opened a flourishing time for temporal
statistic investigation as a powerful tool to reveal the fundamental physics in
different laser scenarios. However, up to now, optical RW behavior with
temporally localized structure has yet not been presented in random fiber laser
(RFL) characterized with mirrorless open cavity, whose feedback arises from
distinctive distributed multiple scattering. Here, thanks to the participation
of sustained and crucial stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) process,
experimental explorations of optical RW are done in the highly-skewed transient
intensity of an incoherently-pumped standard-telecom-fiber-constructed RFL.
Furthermore, threshold-like beating peak behavior can also been resolved in the
radiofrequency spectroscopy. Bringing the concept of optical RW to RFL domain
without fixed cavity may greatly extend our comprehension of the rich and
complex kinetics such as photon propagation and localization in disordered
amplifying media with multiple scattering.

isotropic pressure and incompressible flow parallel to the magnetic field
introduced therein in the case of respective CGL equilibria with anisotropic
pressure. We find that the geometrical symmetry of the field-aligned equilibria
can break by those transformations only when the magnetic field is purely
poloidal. In this situation we derive three-dimensional CGL equilibria from
given axisymmetric ones. Also, we examine the generic symmetry transformations
for MHD and CGL equilibria with incompressible flow of arbitrary direction,
introduced in a number of papers, and find that they cannot break the
geometrical symmetries of the original equilibria, unless the velocity and
magnetic field are collinear and purely poloidal.

As a result, the concepts of dependability and security get deeply intertwined.
The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the
system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This
paper summarizes state-of-the-art of existing work on anomaly detection,
fault-tolerance and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable
to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods
ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the
main challenges in building a resilient IoT for CPS which is crucial in the era
of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system
is connected autonomous vehicles). It further summarizes our solutions,
work-in-progress and future work to this topic to enable ""Trustworthy IoT for
CPS"". Finally, this framework is illustrated on a selected use case: A smart

topological structure of the incompressible bulk phase. Here we show that noise
of electrical current carried through the edge evidences the interplay between
these two topological observables. Transport through a structured edge is
modeled by a voltage-biased line junction made up of two counter-propagating
modes associated with respective filling factors. Specifically, we focus on the
edge of a $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state. Noise is generated at a
point distinctly separated from the hot spot (where most of the Ohmic
dissipation takes place) and reflects the competition between ballistically
carried downstream current and diffusively carried heat (which can propagate
also upstream). We propose specific setups where our predictions can be
measured.

  algorithm for graphs of bounded mim-width",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A semitotal dominating set of a graph $G$ with no isolated vertex is a
dominating set $D$ of $G$ such that every vertex in $D$ is within distance two
of another vertex in $D$. The minimum size $\gamma_{t2}(G)$ of a semitotal
dominating set of $G$ is squeezed between the domination number $\gamma(G)$ and
the total domination number $\gamma_{t}(G)$.
  \textsc{Semitotal Dominating Set} is the problem of finding, given a graph
$G$, a semitotal dominating set of $G$ of size $\gamma_{t2}(G)$. In this paper,
we continue the systematic study on the computational complexity of this
problem when restricted to special graph classes. In particular, we show that
it is solvable in polynomial time for the class of graphs with bounded
mim-width by a reduction to \textsc{Total Dominating Set} and we provide
several approximation lower bounds for subclasses of subcubic graphs. Moreover,
we obtain complexity dichotomies in monogenic classes for the decision versions
of \textsc{Semitotal Dominating Set} and \textsc{Total Dominating Set}.
  Finally, we show that it is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete to recognise the graphs
such that $\gamma_{t2}(G) = \gamma_{t}(G)$ and those such that $\gamma(G) =
\gamma_{t2}(G)$, even if restricted to be planar and with maximum degree at
most $4$, and we provide forbidden induced subgraph characterisations for the
graphs heriditarily satisfying either of these two equalities.

paramagnet-ferromagnet transition in (In,Mn)As and so on. The key to such
modulation is charge accumulation in solids. Thus, it has been believed that
such modulation is out of reach for conventional metals where the number of
carriers is too large. However, success in tuning the Curie temperature of
ultrathin cobalt gave hope of finally achieving such degree of control even in
metallic materials. Here, we show reversible modulation of up to two orders of
magnitude of the inverse spin Hall effect - a phenomenon that governs
interconversion between spin and charge currents - in ultrathin platinum.
Spin-to-charge conversion enables the generation and use of electric and spin
currents in the same device, which is crucial for the future of spintronics and
electronics.

microwave application in the cavity of the electron spin resonance system (ESR)
was measured at room temperature by fabricating a Cu/Sb thermocouple onto it.
To date, thermal transport in YIG films caused by the Damon-Eshbach mode (DEM)
- the unidirectional spin-wave heat conveyer effect - was demonstrated only by
the excitation using coplanar waveguides. Here we show that effect exists even
under YIG excitation using the ESR cavity - tool often employed to realize spin
pumping. The temperature difference observed around the ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) field under the 4 mW microwave power peaked at 13 mK. The observed
thermoelectric signal indicates the imbalance of the population between the
DEMs that propagate near the top and bottom surfaces of the YIG film. We
attribute the DEM population imbalance to the different magnetic damping near
the top and bottom YIG surfaces. Additionally, the spin wave dynamics of the
system were investigated using the micromagnetic simulations. The micromagnetic
simulations confirmed the existence of the DEM imbalance in the system with the
increased Gilbert damping at one of the YIG interfaces. The reported results
are indispensable for the quantitative estimation of the electromotive force in
the spin-charge conversion experiments using ESR cavities.

the public grid (50 or 60 Hz) are special in many senses. One is that they
exist in a just few countries around the world. However, for these countries
such low frequency railways are a critical part of their infrastructure.
  The number of published dynamic models as well as stability studies regarding
low frequency railways is small, compared to corresponding publications
regarding 50 Hz/60 Hz public grids. Since there are two main type of low
frequency railways; synchronous and asynchronous, it makes the number of
available useful publications even smaller. One important reason for this is
the small share of such grids on a global scale, resulting in less research and
development man hours spent on low frequency grids.
  This work presents an open model of a (synchronous-synchronous) rotary
frequency converter for electromechanical stability studies in the phasor
domain, based on established synchronous machine models. The proposed model is
designed such that it can be used with the available data for a rotary
frequency converter.
  The behaviour of the model is shown through numerical electromechanical
transient stability simulations of two example cases, where a fault is cleared,
and the subsequent oscillations are shown. The first example is a single-fed
catenary section and the second is doubly-fed catenary section.

the cyclical learning rate and the increased number of epochs for local model

competitive performance in the decentralized mode compared to the

that to achieve unbiased simulation of finite order NARMAX models, in general,
we require infinite order simulation models. The main contributions of the
paper are two-fold. Firstly, an alternate representation of polynomial NARMAX
models, based on Hermite polynomials, is proposed. The proposed representation
provides a convenient way to translate a polynomial NARMAX model to a
corresponding simulation model by simply setting certain terms to zero. This
translation is exact when the simulation model can be written as an NFIR model.
Secondly, a parameterized approximation method is proposed to curtail infinite
order simulation models to a finite order. The proposed approximation can be
viewed as a trade-off between the conventional approach of setting noise
contributions to zero and the approach of incorporating the bias introduced by
higher-order moments of the noise distribution. Simulation studies are provided
to illustrate the utility of the proposed representation and approximation
method.

this paper, we closely examine the conditions for realizing a robust chiral
$p-$wave order in this system, rather than conventional $s$-wave
superconductivity. Further, within the $p$-wave superconducting phase, we
identify parameter regimes where impurity bound (Shiba) states depend crucially
on the existence of the chiral $p-$wave order, and distinguish them from other
regimes where the chiral $p-$wave order does exist but the impurity-induced
subgap bound states cannot be used as evidence for it. Such a distinction can
provide an easily realizable experimental test for chiral $p-$wave order in
this system. Notably, we have obtained exact analytical expressions for the
bound state wavefunctions in point defects, in the chiral $p-$wave
superconducting state, and find that instead of the usual $exponential$ decay
profile that characterizes bound states, these states decay as a $power-law$ at
large distances from the defect. As a possible application of our findings, we
also show that the zero-energy Shiba states in point defects possess an
internal SU(2) rotational symmetry which enables them to be useful as quantum

  Gaussian residual speckle noise",,,"10.1093/mnras/stz1350",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task as it requires to reach a
high contrast at very close separation to the star. Today, the main limitation
in the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles that are created by
residual instrumental aberrations. They have the same angular size as planetary
companions and are often brighter, hence hindering our capability to detect
exoplanets. Dedicated observation strategies and signal processing techniques
are necessary to disentangle these speckles from planetary signals. The output
of these methods is a detection map in which the value of each pixel is related
to a probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found in
the literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is Gaussian.
However, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates, especially close
to the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of detection map by
analyzing the speckle noise distribution, namely the Modified Rician
distribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum of random variables to
show that the tail of the distribution of the residual noise decays as an
exponential distribution, hence explaining the high false detection rate
obtained with the Gaussian assumption. From this analysis, we introduce a novel
time domain detection map and we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance
of our approach through experiments on real data. We also provide an empirical
rule to determine detection threshold providing a good trade off between true
positive and false positive rates for exoplanet detection.

With optimized length ratio and feasible assembly of two phase change

contribute to align the convective-intensified thermal conductive profiles,
mandatory for heat flux manipulation within temperature bias of 10~40 {\deg}C.
The most significant finding discloses the fact that supercooling elongates the

allows to tune the thermal rectification ratio at any temperature bias within

play an important role in the energy exchange between normal modes. In the
weakly nonlinear regime, those interactions may facilitate energy equipartition
in Fourier space. We consider analytically resonant wave-wave interactions for
the celebrated Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system. Using a
number-theoretical approach based on cyclotomic polynomials, we show that the
problem of finding exact resonances for a system of N particles is equivalent
to a Diophantine equation whose solutions depend sensitively on the set of
divisors of N. We provide an algorithm to construct all possible resonances,
based on two methods: pairing-off and cyclotomic, which we introduce to build
up explicit solutions to the 4-, 5- and 6-wave resonant conditions. Our results
shed some light in the understanding of the long-standing FPUT paradox,
regarding the sensitivity of the resonant manifolds with respect to the number
of particles N and the corresponding time scale of the interactions leading to
thermalisation. In this light we demonstrate that 6-wave resonances always
exist for any N, while 5-wave resonances exist if N is divisible by 3 and N >
6. It is known (for finite N) that 4-wave resonances do not mix energy across
the spectrum, so we investigate whether 5-wave resonances can produce energy
mixing across a significant region of the Fourier spectrum by analysing the
interconnected network of Fourier modes that can interact nonlinearly via
resonances. The answer depends on the set of odd divisors of N that are not
divisible by 3: the size of this set determines the number of dynamically
independent components, corresponding to independent constants of motion
(energies). We show that 6-wave resonances connect all these independent
components, providing in principle a restoring mechanism for full-scale
thermalisation.

first stage deciding the post-restoration topology and the second stage
determining the set of loads to be restored and the outputs of sources. In the
second stage, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer semidefinite

their priority. The unbalanced three-phase power flow constraint and

deal with integer variables and can attain the global optimum of the critical

$\alpha$-attractor-type double inflation. The model is composed of two
minimally coupled scalar fields, where each of the fields has a potential of
the $\alpha$-attractor type. We find that the background trajectory in this
double inflation model is given by two almost straight lines connected with a
turn in the field space. With this simple background, we can classify the
property of the perturbations generated in this double inflation model just
depending on whether the turn occurs before the horizon exit for the mode
corresponding to the scale of interest or not. In the former case, the
resultant primordial curvature perturbation coincides with the one obtained by
the single-field $\alpha$-attractor. On the other hand, in the latter case, it
is affected by the multifield effects, like the mixing with the isocurvature
perturbation and the change of the Hubble expansion rate at the horizon exit.
We obtain the approximated analytic solutions for the background, with which we
can calculate the primordial curvature perturbation by the $\delta N$ formalism
analytically, even when the multifield effects are significant. We also impose
observational constraints on the model parameters and initial values of the
fields in this double inflation model based on the Planck result.

attractive for its simplicity but ignores important physical effects and can be
inaccurate in many cases. To overcome this problem, we consider a recently
developed grid of about 7000 one-dimensional upper-atmosphere hydrodynamic
models computed for a wide range of planets with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres
from which we extract the mass-loss rates. The grid boundaries are [1:39]
MEARTH in planetary mass, [1:10] REARTH in planetary radius, [300:2000] K in

extreme ultraviolet luminosity. We then derive an analytical expression for the
atmospheric mass-loss rates based on a fit to the values obtained from the
grid. The expression provides the mass-loss rates as a function of planetary
mass, planetary radius, orbital separation, and incident stellar high-energy
flux. We show that this expression is a significant improvement to the
energy-limited approximation for a wide range of planets. The analytical
expression presented here enables significantly more accurate planetary

the forefront of our understanding of materials science, chemistry, biology,

X-rays, as electrons accelerated in wakefields emit short-wavelength radiation
due to betatron oscillations. While applications such as phase-contrast imaging
with these betatron sources have already been demonstrated, others would
require higher photon number and would benefit from increased tunability. In
this paper we demonstrate, through detailed 3D simulations, a novel
configuration for a laser-wakefield betatron source that increases the energy
of the X-ray emission and also provides increased flexibility in the tuning of
the X-ray photon energy. This is made by combining two Laguerre-Gaussian pulses
with non-zero net orbital angular momentum, leading to a rotation of the
intensity pattern, and hence, of the driven wakefields. The helical motion
driven by the laser rotation is found to dominate the radiation emission,
rather than the betatron oscillations. Moreover, the radius of this helical
motion can be controlled through the laser spot size and orbital angular
momentum indexes, meaning that the radiation can be tuned fully independently
of the plasma parameters.

attractors is proposed. It is based on using oscillators, the transfer of
excitation between which is provided resonantly due to the difference in the
frequencies of small and large oscillations by an integer number of times being
accompanied by phase transformation according to Bernoulli nap. We consider a
system with Smale-Williams attractor, which is based on two coupled
Bonhoeffer-van der Pol oscillators. The oscillators manifest activity and
suppression turn by turn. With appropriate selection of the modulation,
relaxation oscillations occur at the end of each activity stage, the frequency
of which is by an integer factor $M = 2,3,4,\ldots$ smaller than that of small
oscillations. When the partner oscillator enters the activity stage, the
oscillations start being stimulated by the M-th harmonic of the relaxation
oscillations, so that the transformation of phase during the modulation period
corresponds to the M-fold Bernoulli map. In the state space of the Poincar\'e
map this corresponds to Smale-Williams attractor, constructed with M-fold
increase in the number of turns of the winding at each step of the mapping. The
results of numerical studies confirming the occurrence of the hyperbolic
attractors in certain parameter domains are presented, including the portraits
of attractors, diagrams illustrating the phase transformation according to the
Bernoulli map, Lyapunov exponents, and charts of regimes in parameter planes.
The hyperbolic nature of the attractors is verified by numerical tests that
confirm absence of tangencies of stable and unstable manifolds for trajectories
on the attractor (criterion of angles). An electronic circuit is proposed that
implements this principle of obtaining the hyperbolic chaos and its functioning
is demonstrated using the software package Multisim.

Specifically, one algorithm employs gradient descent for obtaining the RIS

realistic power consumption model for RIS-based systems is presented, and the

seen in a number of protoplanetary disks. They are most commonly interpreted as
the two shadows cast by a highly misaligned inner disk. Direct evidence of such
an inner disk, however, remain largely illusive, except in rare cases. In 2012,
a pair of such shadows were discovered in scattered light observations of the
near face-on disk around 2MASS J16042165-2130284, a transitional object with a
cavity $\sim$60 AU in radius. The star itself is a `dipper', with
quasi-periodic dimming events on its light curve, commonly hypothesized as
caused by extinctions by transiting dusty structures in the inner disk. Here,
we report the detection of a gas disk inside the cavity using ALMA observations
with $\sim0$\farcs2 angular resolution. A twisted butterfly pattern is found in
the moment 1 map of CO (3-2) emission line towards the center, which is the key
signature of a high misalignment between the inner and outer disks. In
addition, the counterparts of the shadows are seen in both dust continuum
emission and gas emission maps, consistent with these regions being cooler than
their surroundings. Our findings strongly support the hypothesized
misaligned-inner-disk origin of the shadows in the J1604-2130 disk. Finally,
the inclination of inner disk would be close to -45 $^{\circ}$ in contrast with
45 $^{\circ}$; it is possible that its internal asymmetric structures cause the
variations on the light curve of the host star.

Observatory. Such observations raise many questions as to how such energies can
be reached and what source can possibly produce them. Although at lower
energies, mechanisms such as Fermi acceleration in supernovae front shocks seem
to be favored, top-down scenarios have been proposed to explain the existence
of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays: the decay of super-massive long-lived
particles produced in the early Universe may yield to a flux of ultra-high
energy photons. Such photons might be presently generating so called
super-preshowers, an extended cosmic-ray shower with a spatial distribution
that can be as wide as the Earth diameter. The Cosmic Ray Extremely Distributed
Observatory (CREDO) mission is to find such events by means of a network of
detectors spread around the globe. CREDO's strategy is to connect existing
detectors and create a worldwide network of cosmic-ray observatories. Moreover,
citizen-science constitutes an important pillar of our approach. By helping our
algorithms to recognize detection patterns and by using smartphones as
individual cosmic-ray detectors, non-scientists can participate in scientific
discoveries and help unravel some of the deepest mysteries in physics.

correlation function (structure factor) in concentrated solutions and melts of
dipolar as well as ionic polymers. The theory captures effects of electrostatic
fluctuations on the structure factor and provides insights into the origin of
experimentally observed enhanced scattering at ultralow wavevectors in
salt-free ionic polymers. It is shown that the enhanced scattering can
originate from a coupling between fluctuations of electric polarization and
monomer density. Local and non-local effects of the polarization resulting from
finite sized permanent dipoles and ion-pairs in dipolar and charge regulating
ionic polymers, respectively, are considered. Theoretical calculations reveal
that, similar to the salt-free ionic polymers, the structure factor for dipolar
polymers can also exhibit a peak at a finite wavevector and enhanced scattering
at ultralow wavevectors. Although consideration of dipolar interactions leads
to attractive interactions between monomers, the enhanced scattering at
ultralow wavevectors is predicted solely on the basis of the electrostatics of
weakly inhomoge- neous dipolar and ionic polymers without considering the
effects of any aggregates or phase separation. Thus, we conclude that neither
aggregation nor phase separation is necessary for observing the enhanced
scattering at ultralow wave-vectors in salt-free dipolar and ionic polymers.
For charge regulating ionic polymers, it is shown that electrostatic
interactions between charged monomers get screened with a screening length,
which depends not only on the concentration of free counterions and coions but
also on the concentration of adsorbed ions on the polymer chains. Qualitative
comparisons with the experimental scattering curves for ionic and dipolar
polymer melts are presented using the theory developed in this work.

half-space arbitrarily $m$-magnetized Glauber-Ising chain as a Fredholm
Pfaffian gap probability generating function with a sech-kernel. This is then
spelled out as a tau-function for a certain Painlev\'e VI transcendent, the
persistence exponent $\theta(m)/2$ emerging as an asymptotic decay rate. Using
a known yet remarkable correspondence that relates Painlev\'e equations to
Bonnet surfaces, the persistence probability also acquires a geometric meaning
in terms of the mean curvature of the latter, and even a topological one at the
magnetization-symmetric point. Since the same sech-kernel with an underlying
Pfaffian structure shows up in a variety of Gaussian first-passage problems,
our Painlev\'e VI provides their universal first-passage probability
distribution, in a manner exactly analogous to the famous Painlev\'e II
Tracy-Widom laws. The tail behavior in the magnetization-symmetric case of our
full scaling function allows to recover the exact persistence exponent
$\theta(0)/2=3/16$ for the $2d$-diffusing random field or for random real Kac's
polynomials, a particular result found very recently by Poplavskyi and Schehr
(Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 121}, 150601 (2018)). Our Painlev\'e VI tau-function
characterization of the persistence probability also bears a correspondence
with a $c=1$ conformal field theory, the monodromy parameters giving the
dimensions of the associated primary fields. Thereby $\theta(0)/2=3 \beta/2$,
with $\beta=1/8$ the Onsager-Yang magnetization exponent for the critical $2d$
Ising model. This relates a nonequilibrium exponent to ordinary static critical
behavior in one more space dimension, and suggests more generally that methods
of boundary conformal field theory should be helpful for determining the
critical properties of other unsolved nonequilibrium $1d$ processes.

Universe. Their prompt gamma-ray radiation corresponds to an energy release of
1E42-1E47J. Fifty years after their discovery and several dedicated space-based
instruments, the physical origin of this emission is still unknown. Synchrotron
emission has been one of the early contenders but was criticized because
spectral fits of empirical models (such as a smoothly-connected broken power
law or a cut-off power law) suggest too hard a slope of the low-energy power
law, violating the so-called synchrotron line-of-death. We perform
time-resolved gamma-ray spectroscopy of single-peaked GRBs as measured with
Fermi/GBM. We demonstrate that idealized synchrotron emission, when properly
incorporating time-dependent cooling of the electrons, is capable of fitting
~95% of all these GBM spectra. The comparison with spectral fit results based
on previous empirical models demonstrates that the past exclusion of
synchrotron radiation as an emission mechanism derived via the line-of-death
was misleading. Our analysis probes the physics of these ultra-relativistic
outflows and the related microphysical processes, and for the first time
provides estimates of magnetic field strength and Lorentz factors of the
emitting region directly from spectral fits. Our modeling of the Fermi/GBM
observations provides evidence that GRBs are produced by moderately magnetized
jets in which relativistic mini-jets emit optically-thin synchrotron radiation
at large emission radii.

(PCA) and related tasks using strictly local learning rules have been
previously derived based on the principle of similarity matching: similar pairs

these networks (and of similar networks) requires a fixed-point iteration to
determine the output corresponding to a given input, which means that dynamics
must operate on a faster time scale than the variation of the input. Further,
during these fast dynamics such networks typically ""disable"" learning, updating
synaptic weights only once the fixed-point iteration has been resolved. Here,
we derive a network for PCA-based dimensionality reduction that avoids this
fast fixed-point iteration. The key novelty of our approach is a modification
of the similarity matching objective to encourage near-diagonality of a
synaptic weight matrix. We then approximately invert this matrix using a Taylor
series approximation, replacing the previous fast iterations. In the offline
setting, our algorithm corresponds to a dynamical system, the stability of
which we rigorously analyze. In the online setting (i.e., with stochastic
gradients), we map our algorithm to a familiar neural network architecture and
give numerical results showing that our method converges at a competitive rate.
The computational complexity per iteration of our online algorithm is linear in
the total degrees of freedom, which is in some sense optimal.

use of dimensionality reduction techniques to extract explanatory

it would be desirable to interpret the model in terms of the original features

latent low-dimensional representations, external covariates, and non-linear
interactions between the two. In this paper, we propose to achieve this through
a structured kernel decomposition in a hybrid Gaussian Process model which we
call the Covariate Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (c-GPLVM). We
demonstrate the utility of our model on simulated examples and applications in
disease progression modelling from high-dimensional gene expression data in the
presence of additional phenotypes. In each setting we show how the c-GPLVM can
extract low-dimensional structures from high-dimensional data sets whilst
allowing a breakdown of feature-level variability that is not present in other
commonly used dimensionality reduction approaches.

similar curves from their noisy images under an operator that does not have a
bounded inverse. Problems of this kind appear in many areas of application.
Routinely, in such problems clustering is carried out at the pre-processing
step and then the inverse problem is solved for each of the cluster averages
separately. As a result, the errors of the procedures are usually examined for
the estimation step only. The objective of this paper is to examine, both
theoretically and via simulations, the effect of clustering on the accuracy of
the solutions of general ill-posed linear inverse problems. In particular, we
assume that one observes $X_m = A f_m + \delta \epsilon_m$, $m=1, \cdots, M$,
where functions $f_m$ can be grouped into $K$ classes and one needs to recover
a vector function ${\bf f}= (f_1,\cdots, f_M)^T$. We construct an estimators
for ${\bf f}$ as a solution of a penalized optimization problem and derive an
oracle inequality for its precision. By deriving upper and minimax lower bounds
for the error, we confirm that the estimator is minimax optimal or nearly
minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor of the number of observations. One
of the advantages of our estimation procedure is that we do not assume that the
number of clusters is known in advance. We conclude that clustering at the
pre-processing step is beneficial when the problem is moderately ill-posed. It
should be applied with extreme care when the problem is severely ill-posed.

analysis of the quartic Casimir invariants, for which we provide a review using
conventions adapted to Feynman diagram calculations. Finally, our computations
show that at one loop, some operators are redundant whatever the representation

age for stars in MS and RGB phases. We adopted Teff, [Fe/H], Delta_nu and
nu_max as observational constraints. Artificial stars were sampled from a
reference isochrone and subjected to random perturbation to simulate
observational errors. Their ages were then recovered by means of a MCMC
approach. The differences between the recovered and true ages were modelled
against the errors in the observables by means of linear models and projection
pursuit regression models. From linear models we find that no age error source
dominates. For MS the most important error source is Teff. An offset of 75 K
accounts for an underestimation of the stellar age from 0.4 to 0.6 Gyr for
initial and terminal MS. An error of 2.5% in nu_max accounted for about -0.3
Gyr. A 0.1 dex error in [Fe/H] resulted particularly important only at the end
of the MS, with an age error of -0.4 Gyr. For the RGB phase the dominant source
of uncertainty is nu_max, causing an underestimation of about 0.6 Gyr; the
offset in the effective temperature and Delta_nu caused respectively an
underestimation and overestimation of 0.3 Gyr. We find that the inference from
the linear model is a good proxy for that from projection pursuit regression
models, so that linear models can be safely used thanks to its broader
generalizability. Finally, we explored the impact on age estimates of adding
the luminosity to the other observational constraints. We assumed - for
computational reasons - a 2.5% error in luminosity, much lower than the average
error in the Gaia DR2 catalogue. Even in this optimistic case, the luminosity
does not increase precision of age estimates. Moreover, the luminosity resulted
as a major contributor to the variability in the estimated ages, accounting for
an error of about -0.3 Gyr in the explored evolutionary phases.

networks (CNN), in particular those based on U-Net, have led to improved
performances for this task. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that
improves standard U-Net based methods in three important ways. First, instead
of combining the available image modalities at the input, each of them is
processed in a different path to better exploit their unique information.
Moreover, the network is densely-connected (i.e., each layer is connected to
all following layers), both within each path and across different paths,
similar to HyperDenseNet. This gives our model the freedom to learn the scale
at which modalities should be processed and combined. Finally, inspired by the
Inception architecture, we improve standard U-Net modules by extending
inception modules with two convolutional blocks with dilated convolutions of
different scale. This helps handling the variability in lesion sizes. We split
the 93 stroke datasets into training and validation sets containing 83 and 9

conditions justifying the use of BG statistics are not fulfilled and the
systems produced are not extensive. This can be accounted for either by
enriching the original dynamics or by replacing the BG statistics by its
nonextensive counterpart described by a nonextensivity parameter $q\neq 1$ (for
$q \to 1$ one returns to the extensive situation). In this work we investigate
the interplay between the effects of dynamics and nonextensivity. Since the
complexity of the nonextensive MF models prevents their simple visualization,
we instead use some simple quasi-particle description of QCD matter in which
the interaction is modelled phenomenologically by some effective fugacities,
$z$. Embedding such a model in a nonextensive environment allows for a
well-defined separation of the dynamics (represented by $z$) and the
nonextensivity (represented by $q$) and a better understanding of their
relationship.

relativistic $e^{\pm}$ pairs would loss energy through inverse-Compton
scattering (ICS) photons of cosmic microwave background (CMB) or plasma

assumption that the dominant energy-loss process is ICS, the resulted cascade
GeV radiation is usually used to constrain the intergalactic magnetic field

the calculation of cascade gamma-ray flux, and investigate the impact of the
plasma instability on the constraint of IGMF. The up-to-date GeV data and
archival TeV data of the blazar 1ES 0229+200 are used. The results indicate
that even if the oblique instability cooling is dominating over ICS cooling,
the cascade flux could be still used to constrain the IGMF. It is found that
with the ratio between the cooling rates of the oblique instability and the ICS
varying from 0.1, 1 to 10, the lower limit of the IGMF putted by the cascade
flux and the gamma-ray data changes from $8\times10^{-18}\ $G,
$5\times10^{-18}\ $G to $10^{-18}\ $G. If the ratio between the two cooling

suggest a connection between theories of gravity and Navier-Stokes (NS)
equation of fluid dynamics. It emerges out that gravity theory can be treated
as some kind of fluid on a particular surface. Motivated by the work carried
out by Bredberg et al (JHEP 1207, 146 (2012)) \cite{Bredberg:2011jq}, our paper
focuses on including certain modes to the metric which are consistent with the
so called hydrodynamic scaling and discuss the consequences, one of which
appear in the form of Damour Navier Stokes (DNS) equation with the
incompressibility condition. We also present an alternative route to the
results by considering the metric as a perturbative expansion in the
hydrodynamic scaling parameter $\epsilon$ and with a specific gauge choice,
thus modifying the metric. It is observed that the inclusion of certain modes
in the metric corresponds to the solution of Einstein's equations in presence
of a particular type of matter in the spacetime. This analysis reveals that
gravity has both the NS and DNS description not only on a null surface, but
also on a timelike surface. So far we are aware of, this analysis is the first
attempt to illuminate the possibility of presenting the gravity dual of DNS
equation on a timelike surface. In addition, an equivalence between the
hydrodynamic expansion and the near-horizon expansion has also been studied in
the present context.

in a soft-wall AdS/QCD model with $SU_L(N_f)\times SU_R(N_f)$ symmetry,
especially for $N_f=2,3$ and $N_f=2+1$. It is shown that in quark mass
plane($m_{u/d}-m_s$) chiral phase transition is second order at a certain
critical line, by which the whole plane is divided into first order and
crossover regions. The critical exponents $\beta$ and $\delta$, describing
critical behavior of chiral condensate along temperature axis and light quark
mass axis, are extracted both numerically and analytically. The model gives the
critical exponents of the values $\beta=\frac{1}{2}, \delta=3$ and
$\beta=\frac{1}{3}, \delta=3$ for $N_f=2$ and $N_f=3$ respectively. For
$N_f=2+1$, in small strange quark mass($m_s$) region, the phase transitions for
strange quark and $u/d$ quarks are strongly coupled, and the critical exponents
are $\beta=\frac{1}{3},\delta=3$; when $m_s$ is larger than
$m_{s,t}=0.290\rm{GeV}$, the dynamics of light flavors($u,d$) and strange
quarks decoupled and the critical exponents for $\bar{u}u$ and $\bar{d}d$
becomes $\beta=\frac{1}{2},\delta=3$, exactly the same as $N_f=2$ result and
the mean field result of 3D Ising model; between the two segments, there is a
tri-critical point at $m_{s,t}=0.290\rm{GeV}$, at which
$\beta=0.250,\delta=4.975$. In some sense, the current results is still at mean
field level, and we also showed the possibility to go beyond mean field
approximation by including the higher power of scalar potential and the
temperature dependence of dilaton field, which might be reasonable in a full
back-reaction model. The current study might also provide reasonable
constraints on constructing a realistic holographic QCD model, which could
describe both chiral dynamics and glue-dynamics correctly.

of spin current injected with incoherent magnons to a superfluid spin current
near the interface where spin is injected. The Gilbert damping parameter in the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory does not describe dissipation properly, and the
dissipation parameters are calculated from the Boltzmann equation for magnons
scattered by defects. The two-fluid theory is developed similar to the
two-fluid theory for superfluids. This theory shows that the influence of
temperature variation in bulk on the superfluid spin transport (bulk Seebeck
effect) is weak at low temperatures. The scenario that the results of Yuan et
al. are connected with the Seebeck effect at the interface between the spin
detector and the sample is also discussed.
  The Landau criterion for an antiferromagnet put in a magnetic field is
derived from the spectrum of collective spin modes. The Landau instability
starts in the gapped mode earlier than in the Goldstone gapless mode, in
contrast to easy-plane ferromagnets where the Goldstone mode becomes unstable.
The structure of the magnetic vortex in the geometry of the experiment is
determined. The vortex core has the skyrmion structure with finite
magnetization component normal to the magnetic field. This magnetization
creates stray magnetic fields around the exit point of the vortex line from the
sample, which can be used for experimental detection of vortices.

  Equations",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new approach to the numerical solution of radiative transfer
equations with certified a posteriori error bounds. A key role is played by
stable Petrov--Galerkin type variational formulations of parametric transport
equations and corresponding radiative transfer equations. This allows us to
formulate an iteration in a suitable, infinite dimensional function space that
is guaranteed to converge with a fixed error reduction per step. The numerical
scheme is then based on approximately realizing this iteration within
dynamically updated accuracy tolerances that still ensure convergence to the
exact solution. To advance this iteration two operations need to be performed
within suitably tightened accuracy tolerances. First, the global scattering
operator needs to be approximately applied to the current iterate within a
tolerance comparable to the current accuracy level. Second, parameter dependent
linear transport equations need to be solved, again at the required accuracy of
the iteration. To ensure that the stage dependent error tolerances are met, one
has to employ rigorous a posteriori error bounds which, in our case, rest on a
Discontinuous Petrov--Galerkin (DPG) scheme. These a posteriori bounds are not
only crucial for guaranteeing the convergence of the perturbed iteration but

case in which magnetic fields themselves give rise to a third family of stable

more general point of view: the Quark-Hadron Chiral Parity-Doublet (Q$\chi$P)

connected to either the MIT Bag model with vector interaction (MIT) or to the

deformed stars. We show that strong magnetic fields can destabilize twin star
sequences, with the threshold intensity being model dependent. On the other
hand, magnetic fields can also give rise to twin stars in models that did not
predict these sequences, up to some point when they are again destabilized. In
this sense, magnetic fields can play an important role on the evolution of

due to the accretion of solids and the subsequent convective motions. Using a
constant embryo surface temperature, we show that radiative energy transport
results in a tendency to reduce the entropy in the primordial atmosphere, but
this tendency is alleviated by an increase in the strength of convective energy
transport, triggered by a correspondingly increased super-adiabatic temperature
gradient. As a consequence, the amplitude of the convective motions increase by
roughly an order of magnitude in the vicinity of the embryo. In the cases
investigated here, where the optical depth towards the disk surface is larger
than unity, the reduction of the temperature in the outer parts of the Hill
sphere relative to cases without radiative energy transport is only $\sim$100K,
while the mass density increase is on the order of a factor of two in the inner
parts of the Hill sphere. Our results demonstrate that, unless unrealistically
low dust opacities are assumed, radiative cooling in the context of primordial
rocky planet atmospheres can only become important after the disk surface
density has dropped significantly below minimum-mass-solar-nebula values.

affinity-guided method to encourage each localization map to be consistent with
their intermediate level features. Third, we adopt the training image itself as
guidance and propose a self-guided refinement to further transfer the image's
inherent structure into the maps. Finally, we derive pseudo pixel-level labels
from these localization maps and use the pseudo labels as ground truth to train
the semantic segmentation model. Our proposed self-guided strategy is a unified
framework, which is built on a single network and alternatively updates the
feature representation and refines localization maps during the training
procedure. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark

a misclassification. Understanding overthinking requires studying how each

For prediction transparency, we propose the Shallow-Deep Network (SDN), a
generic modification to off-the-shelf DNNs that introduces internal
classifiers. We apply SDN to four modern architectures, trained on three image
classification tasks, to characterize the overthinking problem. We show that
SDNs can mitigate the wasteful effect of overthinking with confidence-based
early exits, which reduce the average inference cost by more than 50% and
preserve the accuracy. We also find that the destructive effect occurs for 50%
of misclassifications on natural inputs and that it can be induced,
adversarially, with a recent backdooring attack. To mitigate this effect, we
propose a new confusion metric to quantify the internal disagreements that will

which we link to the concept that societies collapse because of the diminishing
returns of complexity proposed by Joseph Tainter. Our model is based on the
description of a socioeconomic system as a trophic chain of energy stocks which
dissipate the energy potential of the available resources. The model produces
various trajectories of decline, in some cases rapid enough that they can be
defined as collapses. At the same time, we observe that the exploitation of the
resource stock (production) has a strongly nonlinear relationship with the
complexity of the system, assumed to be proportional to the size of the stock
termed bureaucracy. These results provide support for Tainter s hypothesis.

opportunities to facilitate Internet-of-Things (IoT) into our daily life, while
their minimalist design also makes IoT devices vulnerable to many active

advocate the use of an antenna array to extract fine-grained physical-layer

of energy consumption and hardware cost that IoT devices cannot afford. To
overcome this predicament, we present ShieldScatter, a lightweight system that
attaches battery-free backscatter tags to single-antenna devices to shield the
system from active attacks. The key insight of ShieldScatter is to
intentionally create multi-path propagation signatures with the careful
deployment of backscatter tags. These signatures can be used to construct a
sensitive profile to identify the location of the signals' arrival, and thus
detect the threat. We prototype ShieldScatter with USRPs and ambient
backscatter tags to evaluate our system in various environments. The
experimental results show that even when the attacker is located only 15 cm
away from the legitimate device, ShieldScatter with merely three backscatter
tags can mitigate 97% of spoofing attack attempts while at the same time
trigger false alarms on just 7% of legitimate traffic.

real-time systems is a stringent requirement. A plethora of existing works
focus on the analysis of Double Data Rate Dynamic Random Access Memories (DDR
DRAMs), or redesigning its memory to provide predictable memory behavior. In
this paper, we show that DDR DRAMs by construction suffer inherent limitations
associated with achieving such predictability. These limitations lead to 1)
highly variable access latencies that fluctuate based on various factors such
as access patterns and memory state from previous accesses, and 2) overly
pessimistic latency bounds. As a result, DDR DRAMs can be ill-suited for some
real-time systems that mandate a strict predictable performance with tight
timing constraints. Targeting these systems, we promote an alternative off-chip
memory solution that is based on the emerging Reduced Latency DRAM (RLDRAM)
protocol, and propose a predictable memory controller (RLDC) managing accesses
to this memory. Comparing with the state-of-the-art predictable DDR
controllers, the proposed solution provides up to 11x less timing variability
and 6.4x reduction in the worst case memory latency.

method to combine the information of two waveform models: an accurate, but
computationally expensive target model, and a fast but less accurate
approximate model. In an automatic process we systematically update the basis
representation of the approximate model using information from the target model

anywhere in the parameter space jointly covered by either the approximate or

proof-of-concept construction of signals from non-precessing, spinning
black-hole binaries based on the phenomenological waveform family. We show that
obvious shortcomings of the previous PhenomB being the approximate model in the

Real-time range verification techniques aim to reduce these uncertainties in
order to take full advantage of the finite range of the primary protons. In
this paper, we propose a novel concept for real-time range verification based
on detection of secondary neutrons produced in nuclear interactions during
proton therapy. The proposed detector concept is simple; consisting of a
hydrogen-rich converter material followed by two charged particle tracking
detectors, mimicking a proton recoil telescopic arrangement. Neutrons incident
on the converter material are converted into protons through elastic and
inelastic (n,p) interactions. The protons are subsequently detected in the
tracking detectors. The information on the direction and position of these
protons is then utilized in a new reconstruction algorithm to estimate the
depth distribution of neutron production by the proton beam, which in turn is
correlated with the primary proton range. In this paper, we present the results
of a Monte Carlo feasibility study and show that the proposed concept could be
used for real-time range verification with millimetric precision in proton

with thicknesses of $\sim$1000 nm and $x$ spanning the dielectric,
transitional, and metallic regions. It is found that the percolation threshold
$x_c$ lies between 0.57 and 0.60. For films with $x$$\lesssim$0.50, the
resistivities $\rho$ as functions of temperature $T$ obey
$\rho\propto\exp(\Delta/k_BT)$ relation ($\Delta$ being the local
superconducting gap and the $k_B$ Boltzmann constant) below the superconducting
transition temperature $T_c$ ($\sim$7 K) of Pb granules. The value of the gap
obtained via this expression is almost identical to that by single electron
tunneling spectra measurement. The magnetoresistance is negative below $T_c$
and its absolute value is far larger than that above $T_c$ at a certain field.
These observations indicate that single electron hopping (or tunneling), rather
than Cooper pair hopping (or tunneling) governs the transport processes below
$T_c$. The temperature dependence of resistivities shows reentrant behavior for
the 0.50$<$$x$$<$0.57 films. It is found that single electron hopping (or
tunneling) also dominates the low-temperature transport process for these
films. The reduction of the single electron concentration leads to an
enhancement of the resisivity at sufficiently low temperature. For the
0.60$\lesssim$$x$$\lesssim$0.72 films, the resistivities sharply decrease with
decreasing temperature just below $T_c$, and then show dissipation effect with
further decreasing temperature. Treating the conducting paths composed of Pb

well explained by a model that includes both thermally activated phase slips

performance evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database demonstrates that the
proposed method can achieve the accuracy of 98% and maintain high accuracy

algorithms. In our studies we are focused on a vertex amplitude of 3+1 D
gravity, associated with a pentagram spin-network. Furthermore, all spin labels
of the spin network are assumed to be equal $j=1/2$, which is crucial for the
introduction of the \emph{intertwiner qubits}. A procedure of determining
modulus squares of vertex amplitudes on universal quantum computers is
proposed. Utility of the approach is tested with the use of: IBM's
\emph{ibmqx4} 5-qubit quantum computer, simulator of quantum computer provided
by the same company and QX quantum computer simulator. Finally, values of the
vertex probability are determined employing both the QX and the IBM simulators
with 20-qubit quantum register and compared with analytical predictions.

The high-sensitivity and resolution at wavelengths of 3~mm and longer will

observe dust emission at wavelengths of 3~mm and longer is motivated by the
fact that dust emission at these wavelengths is more likely to be optically
thin, which is essential to understanding the structure of these disks. We
explore the feasibility of detecting and resolving protostellar disks with a

require wavelength coverage extending at least to $\sim$4~cm to characterize

  We show that LOFAR is incapable of probing the parameter space for DAMPE

  Agents",,,,,"econ.GN cond-mat.stat-mech q-fin.EC q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an analytical treatment of economic systems with an
arbitrary number of agents that keeps track of the systems' interactions and
agents' complexity. This formalism does not seek to aggregate agents. It rather
replaces the standard optimization approach by a probabilistic description of
both the entire system and agents'behaviors. This is done in two distinct
steps. A first step considers an interacting system involving an arbitrary
number of agents, where each agent's utility function is subject to
unpredictable shocks. In such a setting, individual optimization problems need
not be resolved. Each agent is described by a time-dependent probability
distribution centered around his utility optimum. The entire system of agents
is thus defined by a composite probability depending on time, agents'
interactions and forward-looking behaviors. This dynamic system is described by
a path integral formalism in an abstract space-the space of the agents'
actions-and is very similar to a statistical physics or quantum mechanics
system. We show that this description, applied to the space of agents'actions,
reduces to the usual optimization results in simple cases. Compared to a
standard optimization, such a description markedly eases the treatment of
systems with small number of agents. It becomes however useless for a large
number of agents. In a second step therefore, we show that for a large number
of agents, the previous description is equivalent to a more compact description
in terms of field theory. This yields an analytical though approximate
treatment of the system. This field theory does not model the aggregation of a
microeconomic system in the usual sense. It rather describes an environment of
a large number of interacting agents. From this description, various phases or
equilibria may be retrieved, along with individual agents' behaviors and their
interactions with the environment. For illustrative purposes, this paper
studies a Business Cycle model with a large number of agents.

diffusion-reaction system. The diffusion-reaction system is coupled to
stochastic differential equations, which govern the changes in the media
properties. Though homogenization with changing media properties has been
studied in previous findings, there is little research on homogenization when
the media properties change due to stochastic differential equations. Such
processes occur in many applications, where the changes in media properties are
due to particle deposition. In the paper, we investigate the well-posedness of
the nonlinear fine-grid (resolved) problem and derive limiting equations. We
formulate the cell problems and derive the limiting equations, which are
deterministic with nonlinear reaction terms. The limiting equations involve the
invariant measures corresponding to stochastic differential equations. These
obtained results can play an important role for modeling in porous media and
allow the use of simplified and deterministic limiting equations.

performance of WCNSs since then. In this work, the ENO-like stencil selection
procedure of Targeted ENO schemes [Fu et al. JCP 305(2016):333-359] is
introduced for interpolating midpoint variables, targeting compact nonlinear
schemes which fully abandon the oscillatory stencils crossing discontinuities,
and directly apply optimal linear weights when the flow field is smooth, such
that the optimal numerical resolution is fully recovered in smooth flow field.
Several canonical numerical cases of scalar equations and the Euler equations
of gas dynamics are given to examine the performance of the presented method.

providing a rapid transition from ground to airborne locomotion. An effective
jump is predicated on the need to maintain dynamic stability through the
acceleration phase. The present study concerns understanding how birds retain
control of body attitude and trajectory during take-off. Cursory observation
suggests that stability is achieved with relatively little cost. However,
analysis of the problem shows that the stability margins during jumping are
actually very small and that stability considerations play a significant role
in selection of appropriate jumping kinematics. We use theoretical models to
understand stability in prehensile take-off (from a perch) and also in
non-prehensile take-off (from the ground). The primary instability is tipping,
defined as rotation of the centre of gravity about the ground contact point.
Tipping occurs when the centre of pressure falls outside the functional foot. A
contribution of the paper is the development of graphical tipping stability
margins for both centre of gravity location and acceleration angle. We show
that the nose-up angular acceleration extends stability bounds forward and is
hence helpful in achieving shallow take-offs. The stability margins are used to
interrogate simulated take-offs of real birds using published experimental
kinematic data from a guinea fowl (ground take-off) and a diamond dove (perch
take-off). For the guinea fowl the initial part of the jump is stable, however
simulations exhibit a stuttering instability not observed experimentally that
is probably due to absence of compliance in the idealised joints. The diamond
dove model confirms that the foot provides an active torque reaction during
take-off, extending the range of stable jump angles by around 45{\deg}.

NHL.com use to rank players before each hockey season. A combination of
physical characteristics, shooting percentage, and usage during games are used
as training features. A novel metric, Player Availability Rating (PAR) is
proposed which utilizes the offensive predictions to predict the availability
of a player during a season. These metrics can be valuable in the NHL as it
would allow for general managers to track a players performance and their
availability during the course of a season.

photocatalytic materials that can produce hydrogen through water splitting. The
solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of these materials is critically dependent on the
electrochemical state of their surface. Here, we develop an embedded
quantum-mechanical approach using the self-consistent continuum solvation
(SCCS) model to predict the relation between band alignment, electrochemical
stability, and photocatalytic activity taking into account the long-range
polarization of the semiconductor electrode under electrical bias. Using this
comprehensive model, we calculate the charge-voltage response of various
reconstructions of a solvated SrTiO3 surface, revealing that interfacial charge
trapping exerts primary control on the electrical response and surface
stability of the photoelectrode. Our results provide a detailed molecular-level
interpretation of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3 upon
voltage-induced restructuring of the semiconductor-solution interface.

massive attention from research and industry. Integrating and composing smart
objects functionalities or their services is required to create and promote
more complex IoT applications with advanced features. When many smart objects
are deployed, selecting the most appropriate set of smart objects to compose a
service by considering both energy and quality of service (QoS) is an essential
and challenging task. In this paper, we reduced the problem of finding an
optimal balance between QoS level and the consumed energy of the IoT service
composition to a bi-objective shortest path optimization (BSPO) problem and
used an exact algorithm named pulse to solve the problem. The BSPO has two
objectives, minimizing the QoS including execution time, network latency, and
service price, and minimize the energy consumption of the composite service.
Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach has short execution
time in various complex service profiles. Meanwhile, it can obtain good
performance in energy consumption and thus network lifetime while maintaining a
reasonable QoS level.

black holes in an anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spaces was recently proposed [Phys.
Lett. B 768 (2017) 235], where the square of the electric charge $(Q^2)$ of
black hole was regarded as a thermodynamic variable and the cosmological
constant (pressure) as a fixed quantity. In this paper, we address the
universality class and critical properties of any AdS black hole in this
alternative phase space. We disclose the critical behavior of AdS black hole in
the alternative phase space in which a continuous phase transition happens and
in a very general framework, independent of the spacetime metric. Based on the
expansion of the equation of state and Landau thermodynamic potential in the
neighborhood of a critical point in the alternative phase space, we confirm
that the set of values for critical exponents for generic black hole is
analogous to the Van der Waals fluid system. Finally, we reveal that the scalar
curvature in geometry thermodynamic diverges at the critical point of black
hole. Our study shows that the approach here is powerful enough to investigate
the critical behavior of any black holes and further supports the viability of
the alternative viewpoint toward phase space of black holes suggested in [Phys.
Lett. B 768 (2017) 235].
