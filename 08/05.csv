  Economy","A previous version of this paper was circulating under the title
  ""Optimal Management of Debt-to-GDP Ratio with Regime-Switching Interest
  Rate"". In the new version we have improved exposition, generalized the
  setting and some of the results, and reorganized the structure of the paper.
  27 pages, 3 figures. To appear on SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We solve an infinite time-horizon bounded-variation stochastic control
problem with regime switching between $N$ states. This is motivated by the
problem of a government that wants to control the country's debt-to-GDP (gross
domestic product) ratio. In our formulation, the debt-to-GDP ratio evolves
stochastically in continuous time, and its drift -- given by the interest rate
on government debt, net of the growth rate of GDP -- is affected by an
exogenous macroeconomic risk process modelled by a continuous-time Markov chain
with $N$ states. The government can act on the public debt by increasing or
decreasing its level, and it aims at minimising a net expected regime-dependent
cost functional. Without relying on a guess-and-verify approach, but performing
a direct probabilistic study, we show that it is optimal to keep the
debt-to-GDP ratio in an interval, whose boundaries depend on the states of the
risk process. These boundaries are given through a zero-sum optimal stopping
game with regime switching with $N$ states and are characterised through a
system of nonlinear algebraic equations with constraints. To the best of our
knowledge, such a result appears here for the first time. Finally, we put in
practice our methodology in a case study of a Markov chain with $N=2$ states;
we provide a thorough analysis and we complement our theoretical results by a
detailed numerical study on the sensitivity of the optimal debt ratio
management policy with respect to the problem's parameters.

velocity distribution in the solar neighborhood (SN). We propose that the
structures on the $U-V$ planes, known as the moving groups, can be mainly
explained by the spiral arms perturbations. The applied model of the Galactic
disk and spiral arms, with the parameters defined by observational data and
with pattern speed $\Omega_p=$28.0 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, is the same that
allowed us to explain the origin of the Local Arm and the Sun's orbit trapped
inside the corotation resonance (CR). We show that the $U-V$ picture of the SN
consists of the main component, associated with the CR, and the inner and outer
structures, which we could associate with the Hercules and Sirius streams,
respectively. The Coma-Berenices and Hyades-Pleiades groups and the Sun itself
belong to the main part. The substructures of Hercules are formed mainly by the
nearby 8/1, 12/1, and even 6/1 inner Lindblad resonances, while Sirius is
shaped by the bulk of overlapping outer Lindblad resonances, -8/1, -12/1,
-16/1, which are stuck to the CR. This richness in resonances only exists near
corotation, which should be of the spiral arms, not of the Galactic bar, whose
stable corotation zone is far away from the Sun. The model's predictions of the
velocity distribution match qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution
provided by Gaia DR2.

predict stochastic drift of grid responses, which is not observed
experimentally. We demonstrate a biologically plausible mechanism of dynamic
self-organization by which border cells, which fire at environmental

experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity during exploration allows border cells
to learn connectivity to grid cells. Border cells in this learned network reset
the phase of drifting grids. This error-correction mechanism is robust to
environmental shape and complexity, including enclosures with interior
barriers, and makes distinctive predictions for environmental deformation
experiments. Our work demonstrates how diverse cell types in the entorhinal

2050 and exceed six billion. The major challenges confronting cities, such as
sustainability, safety, and equality, will depend on the infrastructure
developed to accommodate the increase. Urban planners have long debated the
consequences of vertical expansion---the concentration of residents by
constructing tall buildings---over horizontal expansion---the dispersal of
residents by extending urban boundaries. Yet relatively little work has
predicted the vertical expansion of cities and quantified the likelihood and
therefore urgency of these consequences.
  We regard tall buildings as random exceedances over a threshold and use
extreme value theory to forecast the skyscrapers that will dominate the urban
skyline in 2050 if present trends continue. We predict forty-one thousand
skyscrapers will surpass 150 meters and 40 floors, an increase of eight percent
a year, far outpacing the expected urban population growth of two percent a
year. The typical tall skyscraper will not be noticeably taller, and the
tallest will likely exceed one thousand meters but not one mile. If a mile-high
skyscraper is constructed, it will hold fewer occupants than many of the
mile-highs currently designed. We predict roughly three-quarters the number of
floors of the Mile-High Tower, two-thirds of Next Tokyo's Sky Mile Tower, and
half the floors of Frank Lloyd Wright's The Illinois---three prominent plans
for a mile-high skyscraper. However, the relationship between floor and height

measure-preserving, ergodic dynamical systems with both atomic and continuous
spectral components is developed. It is based on an approximation of the
generator of the system by a compact operator $W_\tau$ on a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS). A key tool is that $W_\tau$ is skew-adjoint , and thus
can be characterized by a unique projection-valued measure, discrete by
compactness, and an associated orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. These
eigenfunctions can be ordered in terms of a Dirichlet energy on the RKHS, and
provide a notion of coherent observables under the dynamics akin to the Koopman
eigenfunctions associated with the atomic part of the spectrum. In addition,
the regularized generator has a well-defined Borel functional calculus allowing
the construction of a unitary evolution group $\{ e^{t W_\tau}
\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ on the RKHS, which approximates the unitary Koopman
evolution group of the original system. We establish convergence results for
the spectrum and Borel functional calculus of the regularized generator to
those of the original system in the limit $\tau \to 0^+$. Convergence results
are also established for a data-driven formulation, where these operators are
approximated using finite-rank operators obtained from observed time series. An
advantage of working with an RKHS structure is that one can perform pointwise
evaluation and interpolation through bounded linear operators, which is not
possible in $L^p$ spaces. This enables the out of sample evaluation of
data-approximated eigenfunctions, as well as data-driven forecasts initialized
with pointwise initial data (as opposed to probability densities in $L^p$). The
pattern extraction and prediction framework is numerically applied to three
instances of ergodic dynamical systems with atomic and continuous spectra.

through network automation and programmability. Small business networks require
flexibility, like service provider networks, to scale, deploy, and self-heal
network infrastructure that comprises of cloud operating systems, virtual
machines, containers, vendor networking equipment, and virtual network
functions (VNFs); however, as SDN evolves in industry, there has been limited
research to develop an SDN architecture to fulfill the requirements of small
business networks. This research proposes a network architecture that can
abstract, orchestrate, and scale configurations based on small business network
requirements. Our results show that the proposed architecture provides enhanced
network management and operations when combined with the network orchestration
application (NetO-App) developed in this research. The NetO-App orchestrates
network policies, automates configuration changes, and manages internal and
external communication between the campus networking infrastructure.

use of data-driven models for automating various clinical tasks based on ECG
data. The development of subject-specific models are limited by the cost and
difficulty of obtaining sufficient training data for each individual. The
alternative of population model, however, faces challenges caused by the
significant inter-subject variations within the ECG data. We address this
challenge by investigating for the first time the problem of learning
representations for clinically-informative variables while disentangling other
factors of variations within the ECG data. In this work, we present a
conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract the subject-specific
adjustment to the ECG data, conditioned on task-specific representations
learned from a deterministic encoder. To encourage the representation for
inter-subject variations to be independent from the task-specific
representation, maximum mean discrepancy is used to match all the moments
between the distributions learned by the VAE conditioning on the code from the
deterministic encoder. The learning of the task-specific representation is
regularized by a weak supervision in the form of contrastive regularization. We
apply the proposed method to a novel yet important clinical task of classifying
the origin of ventricular tachycardia (VT) into pre-defined segments,
demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method against the standard VAE.

Examples include analyzing network traffic under zero-day attacks, and computer
vision tasks by sensor networks deployed in the field. To handle this
challenging task, organizations often use human analysts to classify events
under high uncertainty. Existing algorithms use a threshold-based mechanism to
decide whether to classify an object automatically or send it to an analyst for

resources since it does not take the practical temporal constraints of system

such kind of signals is in their phase evolution, which is stable over a long
observation run. When using analysis based on matched filtering, the phase
evolution of long-coherent signals is needed to define how to build a proper

characterizes the geometry for the likelihood given by the matched filtering.
Most of the times, the metric for long-coherent signals cannot be computed

accelerations play a key role in the relative motion of bidisperse particles,
and we find that reducing $Fr$ leads to an enhancement of the accelerations,
but a suppression of their intermittency. For Stokes numbers $St>1$, the effect
of $R_\lambda$ on the accelerations is enhanced by gravity, since settling
causes the particle accelerations to be affected by a larger range of flow
scales. The results for the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the particle
relative velocities show that for bidisperse particles, decreasing $Fr$ leads
to an enhancement of their relative velocities in both the vertical (parallel

when the particles are settling very fast, turbulence continues to play a key
role in their vertical relative velocities, and increasingly so as $R_\lambda$
is increased. This occurs because although the settling velocity may be much
larger than typical velocities of the turbulence, due to intermittency, there
are significant regions of the flow where the turbulence contribution to the
particle motion is of the same order as that from gravitational settling...

My algorithm generates both truly Delaunay and constrained Delaunay

feature size (LFS) by solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that map
points from a closed 1D interval to points on the input line segments in the
PSLG. I then refine the Delaunay triangulation (truly or constrained) of the
PSLG by inserting off-center Steiner vertices of ""skinny"" triangles while
prioritizing such triangles with shortest edges first. As in Chew's algorithm,
I show that the Steiner vertices do not encroach upon any subsegment of the
PSLG. The off-center insertion algorithm places Steiner vertices in an
advancing front manner such that we obtain a size-optimal Delaunay mesh (truly

even in the presence of a small angle $\phi < \pi/2$ in the PSLG, the bound on
the minimum angle ""across"" the small angle tends to
$\arctan{((\sin{\phi})/(2-\cos(\phi))}$ as the PSLG is progressively refined.
Also, the bound on the maximum angle across any small input angle tends to
$\pi/2 + \phi/2$ as the PSLG is progressively refined.

problem of designing molecular circuits for demodulation. In our earlier work,
we use a Markovian approach to derive a demodulator for diffusion-based
molecular communication. The demodulation filters take the form of an ordinary
differential equation which computes the log-posteriori probability of a
transmission symbol being sent. This work considers the realisation of these
demodulation filters using molecular circuits assuming the transmission symbols
are rectangular pulses of the same duration but different amplitudes, i.e.
concentration modulation. This paper makes a number of contributions. First, we
use time-scale separation and renewal theory to analytically derive an
approximation of the demodulation filter from our earlier work. Second, we
present a method to turn this approximation into a molecular circuit. By using
simulation, we show that the output of the derived molecular circuit is
approximately equal to the log-posteriori probability calculated by the exact
demodulation filter if the log-posteriori probability is positive. Third, we
demonstrate that a biochemical circuit in yeast behaves similarly to the
derived molecular demodulation filter and is therefore a candidate for
implementing the derived filter.

show that it reaches its maximum at the change-point if a sequence has only one

this to prove that the asymptotic resurgence coincides with the resurgence if

efficient image classification under hardware constraints, prior work has
proposed adaptive CNNs, i.e., systems of networks with different accuracy and
computation characteristics, where a selection scheme adaptively selects the
network to be evaluated for each input image. While previous efforts have
investigated different network selection schemes, we find that they do not
necessarily result in energy savings when deployed on mobile systems. The key
limitation of existing methods is that they learn only how data should be
processed among the CNNs and not the network architectures, with each network
being treated as a blackbox.
  To address this limitation, we pursue a more powerful design paradigm where
the architecture settings of the CNNs are treated as hyper-parameters to be
globally optimized. We cast the design of adaptive CNNs as a hyper-parameter
optimization problem with respect to energy, accuracy, and communication
constraints imposed by the mobile device. To efficiently solve this problem, we
adapt Bayesian optimization to the properties of the design space, reaching
near-optimal configurations in few tens of function evaluations. Our method
reduces the energy consumed for image classification on a mobile device by up
to 6x, compared to the best previously published work that uses CNNs as
blackboxes. Finally, we evaluate two image classification practices, i.e.,

investigate the possibility of applying depthwise separable convolutions in 3D

convolution splits a single standard 3D convolution into two separate steps,
which would drastically reduce the number of parameters in 3D convolutions with
more than one order of magnitude. We experiment with 3D depthwise convolution

carried out with more light-weighted neural networks while still delivering

  Neuroimaging studies","37 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, longitudinal neuroimaging study has become increasingly
popular in neuroscience research to investigate disease-related changes in
brain functions. In current neuroscience literature, one of the most commonly
used tools to extract and characterize brain functional networks is independent
component analysis (ICA). However, existing ICA methods are not suited for
modelling repeatedly measured imaging data. In this paper, we propose a novel
longitudinal independent component model (L-ICA) which provides a formal
modeling framework for extending ICA to longitudinal studies. By incorporating
subject-specific random effects and visit-specific covariate effects, L-ICA is
able to provide more accurate estimates of changes in brain functional networks
on both the population- and individual-level, borrow information across
repeated scans within the same subject to increase statistical power in
detecting covariate effects on the networks, and allow for model-based
prediction for brain networks changes caused by disease progression, treatment
or neurodevelopment. We develop a fully traceable exact EM algorithm to obtain
maximum likelihood estimates of L-ICA. We further develop a subspace-based
approximate EM algorithm which greatly reduce the computation time while still
retaining high accuracy. Moreover, we present a statistical testing procedure
for examining covariate effects on brain network changes. Simulation results
demonstrate the advantages of our proposed methods. We apply L-ICA to ADNI2
study to investigate changes in brain functional networks in Alzheimer disease.
Results from the L-ICA provide biologically insightful findings which are not
revealed using existing methods.

from exchanging information through edges, while continuous technological
progress fosters system functionings that increasingly often rely on
cooperation. Growing attention is being placed on coalition formation, where
each node chooses what coalition to join, while the surplus generated by
cooperation is an amount of TU (transferable utility) quantified by a
real-valued function defined on partitions -or even embedded coalitions- of
nodes. A TU-sharing rule is thus essential, as how players are rewarded
determines their behavior. This work offers a new option for distributing
partition function-based surpluses, dealing with cooperative game theory in
terms of both global games and games in partition function form, namely lattice
functions, while the sharing rule is a point-valued solution or value. The
novelty is grounded on the combinatorial definition of such solutions as
lattice functions whose M\""obius inversion lives only on atoms, i.e. on the
first level of the lattice. While simply rephrasing the traditional solution
concept for standard coalitional games, this leads to distribute the surplus
generated by partitions across the edges of the network, as the atoms among
partitions are unordered pairs of players. These shares of edges are further
divided between nodes, but the corresponding Shapley value is very different
from the traditional one and leads to two alternative forms, obtained by
focusing either on marginal contributions along maximal chains, or else on the
uniform division of Harsanyi dividends. The core is also addressed, and
supermodularity is no longer sufficient for its non-emptiness.

bilayer graphene (TBG) at very small angles, along with nearly flat electron
bands at certain fillings. A good starting point in understanding the physics
is a continuum model (CM) proposed by Lopes dos Santos et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
99, 256802 (2007)] and Bistritzer et al. [PNAS 108, 12233 (2011)] for TBG at
small twist angles, which successfully predicts the bandwidth reduction of the
middle two bands of TBG near the first magic angle $\theta_0=1.05^\circ$. In
this paper, we analyze the symmetries of the CM and investigate the low energy
flat band structure in the entire moir\'e Brillouin zone near $\theta_0$.
Instead of observing flat bands at only one ""magic"" angle, we notice that the
bands remain almost flat within a small range around $\theta_0$, where multiple
topological transitions occur. The topological transitions are caused by the
creation and annihilation of Dirac nodes at either $\text{K}$,
$\text{K}^\prime$, or $\Gamma$ points, or along the high symmetry lines in the
moir\'e Brillouin zone. We trace the evolution of the nodes and find that there
are several processes transporting them from $\Gamma$ to $\text{K}$ and
$\text{K}^\prime$. At the $\Gamma$ point, the lowest energy levels of the CM
are doubly degenerate for some range of twisting angle around $\theta_0$,
suggesting that the physics is not described by any two band model. Based on
this observation, we propose an effective six-band model (up to second order in
quasi-momentum) near the $\Gamma$ point with the full symmetries of the CM,
which we argue is the minimal model that explains the motion of the Dirac nodes
around $\Gamma$ as the twist angle is varied. By fitting the coefficients from
the numerical results, we show that this six-band model captures the important
physics over a wide range of angles near the first ""magic"" angle.

other auxiliary information, language can describe a specific person from more
compact and semantic visual aspects, thus is complementary to the pixel-level
image data. Our method not only learns better global visual feature with the
supervision of the overall description but also enforces semantic consistencies
between local visual and linguistic features, which is achieved by building
global and local image-language associations. The global image-language
association is established according to the identity labels, while the local
association is based upon the implicit correspondences between image regions

employing language as training supervisions with the two association schemes.

For example, given a query video and a reference video, how to accurately

corresponds to the query video? We define a distinctively new task, namely
\textbf{video re-localization}, to address this scenario. Video re-localization
is an important emerging technology implicating many applications, such as fast
seeking in videos, video copy detection, video surveillance, etc. Meanwhile, it
is also a challenging research task because the visual appearance of a semantic
concept in videos can have large variations. The first hurdle to clear for the
video re-localization task is the lack of existing datasets. It is labor
expensive to collect pairs of videos with semantic coherence or correspondence
and label the corresponding segments. We first exploit and reorganize the
videos in ActivityNet to form a new dataset for video re-localization research,
which consists of about 10,000 videos of diverse visual appearances associated
with localized boundary information. Subsequently, we propose an innovative
cross gated bilinear matching model such that every time-step in the reference

the prediction of the starting and ending time is formulated as a

of the current density for a charged fermionic field in background of locally
AdS spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compact dimensions and in
the presence of a constant gauge field. Along compact dimensions the field
operator obeys quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary phases and on the
brane it is constrained by the bag boundary condition. The VEVs for the charge
density and the components of the current density along uncompact dimensions
vanish. The components along compact dimensions are decomposed into the
brane-free and brane-induced contributions. The behavior of the latter in
various asymptotic regions of the parameters is investigated. It particular, it
is shown that the brane-induced contribution is mainly located near the brane
and vanishes on the AdS boundary and on the horizon. An important feature is
the finiteness of the current density on the brane. Applications are given to
$Z_2$-symmetric braneworlds of the Randall-Sundrum type with compact dimensions
for two classes of boundary conditions on the fermionic field. In the special
case of three-dimensional spacetime, the corresponding results are applied for
the investigation of the edge effects on the ground state current density

variety of rhythmic beating patterns from non-planar cone-like motions to
planar wave-like deformations. Although their internal structure, composed of a
microtubule-based axoneme driven by dynein motors, is known, the mechanism
responsible for these beating patterns remains elusive. Existing theories
suggest that the dynein activity is dynamically regulated, via a geometric
feedback from the cilium's mechanical deformation to the dynein force. An
alternative, open-loop mechanism based on a 'flutter' instability was recently
proven to lead to planar oscillations of elastic filaments under follower
forces. Here, we show that an elastic filament in viscous fluid, clamped at one
end and acted on by an external distribution of compressive axial forces,
exhibits a Hopf bifurcation that leads to non-planar spinning of the buckled
filament at a locked curvature. We also show the existence of a second
bifurcation, at larger force values, that induces a transition from non-planar
spinning to planar wave-like oscillations. We elucidate the nature of these
instabilities using a combination of nonlinear numerical analysis, linear
stability theory, and low-order bead-spring models. Our results show that away
from the transition thresholds, these beating patterns are robust to
perturbations in the distribution of axial forces and in the filament
configuration. These findings support the theory that an open-loop,
instability-driven mechanism could explain both the sustained oscillations and
the wide variety of periodic beating patterns observed in cilia and flagella.

is sensitive to changes within the tissue microstructure of the human brain.
However, a major challenge when using MRI to derive quantitative measures is
that the use of different scanners, as used in multi-site group studies,
introduces measurement variability. This can lead to an increased variance in
quantitative metrics, even if the same brain is scanned.
  Contrary to the assumption that these characteristics are comparable and
similar, small changes in these values are observed in many clinical studies,
hence harmonization of the signals is essential.
  In this paper, we present a method that does not require additional
preprocessing, such as segmentation or registration, and harmonizes the signal
based on a deep learning residual network. For this purpose, a training
database is required, which consist of the same subjects, scanned on different
scanners.
  The results show that harmonized signals are significantly more similar to
the ground truth signal compared to no harmonization, but also improve in
comparison to another deep learning method. The same effect is also
demonstrated in commonly used metrics derived from the diffusion MRI signal.

attack edge color bleeding we generate more continuous color maps with sharp

and a scalar DM model. Both models require the presence of two physical Higgs
bosons $h_1$ and $h_2$ which come from mixed components of the standard Higgs
doublet $H$ and a complex singlet $S$. In the Vector model, the extra $U(1)$
symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum of the complex field $S$. This
leads to a massive gauge boson $X^\mu$ that is a DM candidate stabilized by the
dark charge conjugation symmetry $S \to S^*$, $X^\mu\to -X^\mu$. On the other
hand, in the Scalar model the gauge group remains the standard one. The DM
field $A$ is the imaginary component of $S$ and the stabilizing symmetry is
also the dark charge conjugation $S \to S^*$ ($A \to - A$). In this case, in
order to avoid spontaneous breaking, the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken explicitly,
but softly, in the scalar potential. The possibility to disentangle the two
models has been investigated. We have analyzed collider, cosmological, DM
direct and indirect detection constraints and shown that there are regions in
the space spanned by the mass of the non-standard Higgs boson and the mass of
the DM particle where the experimental bounds exclude one of the models. We
have also considered possibility to disentangle the models at $e^+e^-$ collider
and concluded that the process $e^+e^-\to Z + \text{DM}$ provides a useful tool
to distinguish the models.

them different modelling languages such as mobile ambients were developed. To
analyse the quality of mobile ambients as a good foundational model for
distributed computation, we analyse the level of synchronisation between
distributed components that they can express. Therefore, we rely on earlier
established synchronisation patterns. It turns out that mobile ambients are not
fully distributed, because they can express enough synchronisation to express a
synchronisation pattern called M. However, they can express strictly less
synchronisation than the standard pi-calculus. For this reason, we can show
that there is no good and distributability-preserving encoding from the
standard pi-calculus into mobile ambients and also no such encoding from mobile
ambients into the join-calculus, i.e., the expressive power of mobile ambients
is in between these languages. Finally, we discuss how these results can be
used to obtain a fully distributed variant of mobile ambients.

This principle can be formulated in various form. Fundamentally, this principle
can be expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the measured
observables. In quantum information theory the preferred mathematical quantity
to express the entropic uncertainty relation is the Shannon's entropy. In this
work, we consider the generalized entropic uncertainty relation in which there
is an additional particle as a quantum memory. Alice measures on her particle
$A$ and Bob, with memory particle $B$, predicts the Alice's measurement
outcomes. We study the effects of the environment on the entropic uncertainty
lower bound in the presence of weak measurement and measurement reversal. The
dynamical model that is intended in this work is as follows: First the weak
measurement is performed, Second the decoherence affects on the system and at
last the measurement reversal is performed on quantum system . Here we consider
the generalized amplitude damping channel and depolarizing channel as
environmental noises. We will show that in the presence of weak measurement and
measurement reversal, despite the presence of environmental factors, the
entropic uncertainty lower bound dropped to an optimal minimum value. In fact,
weak measurement and measurement reversal enhance the quantum correlation
between the subsystems $A$ and $B$ thus the uncertainty of Bob about Alice's
measurement outcomes reduces.

extremal function is one of the most important tool to investigate derivatives
of polynomials. W. Ple\'sniak in the circle of papers (most important joint
with W. Paw\l{}ucki) showed deep connections between behavior of Siciak
extremal function near compact $K$ and bounds for derivatives of polynomials.
In 1990 W. Ple\'sniak introduced condition (P) which is equivalent to Markov
property of compact $K$. In the same paper there was stated a problem which
property of Siciak's extremal function are necessary to Markov's property. A
stronger question is on H\""older continuity of the logarithm of the Siciak
extremal function. This problem can be formulate in more general case of
arbitrary norms $q$ on the space of polynomials. In the present paper we
investigate the connection between behavior of generalizations of Siciak's
function and the behavior of norms of derivatives of polynomials. In particular
we get some deep properties of Markov factors $M_n(q,k)$ related to the main
problems. One of the main result is the Kolmogorov-Landau type property of
$M_n(q,k)^{1/k}$ which is a condition on the triangle sequence of family of
derivatives of polynomials not for particular polynomials as for direct
analogon of the Kolmogorov-Landau remarkable inequalities: $\log
M_n(q,k)^{1/k}\leq \log const. + (1-\frac{\log k}{\log n})\log
M_n(q,1)+\frac{\log k}{\log n}M_n(q,n)^{1/n},\ 1\leq k\leq n$.It seems that
this condition is satisfied for arbitrary norm $q$. Separately this condition
(a weaker version is sufficient) gives nothing. But if we assume that $q$ has
A. Markov's property with respect to $q$ and satisfies a condition $C(q)>0$
then $q$ posseses Vladimir Markov property. In the case $q(P)=||P||_E$ this

fascinating solution to 3D sensing. CNNs led to considerable improvements in
this field, and recent trends replaced the need for ground-truth labels with
geometry-guided image reconstruction signals enabling unsupervised training.
Currently, for this purpose, state-of-the-art techniques rely on images
acquired with a binocular stereo rig to predict inverse depth (i.e., disparity)
according to the aforementioned supervision principle. However, these methods
suffer from well-known problems near occlusions, left image border, etc
inherited from the stereo setup. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle these
issues by moving to a trinocular domain for training. Assuming the central
image as the reference, we train a CNN to infer disparity representations
pairing such image with frames on its left and right side. This strategy allows
obtaining depth maps not affected by typical stereo artifacts. Moreover, being
trinocular datasets seldom available, we introduce a novel interleaved training
procedure enabling to enforce the trinocular assumption outlined from current
binocular datasets. Exhaustive experimental results on the KITTI dataset
confirm that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised
monocular depth estimation trained on binocular stereo pairs as well as any
known methods relying on other cues.

alignment also facilitates the spatial separation of photogenerated

tool for guiding the planning and execution of interventional procedures. The
functional role of colour information in terms of its potential benefits to
behavioural success across the species is addressed in the introduction here to
clarify why colour perception may have evolved to generate behavioural success.
It is argued that evolutionary and environmental pressures influence not only
colour trait production in the different species, but also their ability to
process and exploit colour information for goal-specific purposes. We then leap
straight to the human primate with insight from current research on the
facilitating role of colour cues on performance training with precision
technology for image-guided surgical planning and intervention. It is shown
that local colour cues in 2D images generated by a surgical fisheye camera help
individuals become more precise rapidly across a limited number of trial sets
in simulator training for specific manual gestures with a tool. The
progressively facilitating effect of a local colour cue on performance
evolution in a video controlled simulator task can be explained in terms of
colour-based figure-ground segregation guiding attention towards local image
parts, with an immediate cost on performance time, and a lasting long-term

radial velocity of open clusters was determined, using the most probable
members available from a previous astrometric investigation that also provided
mean parallaxes and proper motions. Those parameters, all derived from Gaia DR2
only, were combined to provide the 6D phase space information of 861 clusters.
The velocity distribution of nearby clusters was investigated, as well as the
spatial and velocity distributions of the whole sample as a function of age. A
high quality subsample was used to investigate some possible pairs and groups
of clusters sharing the same Galactic position and velocity. Results. For the
high quality sample that has 406 clusters, the median uncertainty of the
weighted mean radial velocity is 0.5 km/s. The accuracy, assessed by comparison
to ground-based high resolution spectroscopy, is better than 1 km/s. Open
clusters nicely follow the velocity distribution of field stars in the close
Solar neighbourhood previously revealed by Gaia DR2. As expected, the vertical
distribution of young clusters is very flat but the novelty is the high
precision to which this can be seen. The dispersion of vertical velocities of
young clusters is at the level of 5 km/s. Clusters older than 1 Gyr span
distances to the Galactic plane up to 1 kpc with a vertical velocity dispersion
of 14 km/s, typical of the thin disc. Five pairs of clusters and one group with
five members are possibly physically related. Other binary candidates
previously identified turn out to be chance alignment.

conjecture does not only regard the amplitude of the tensor spectrum, but also
its tilt, as $c\gtrsim 1$ implies both a yet unobserved tensor to scalar ratio,
and an enhancement of the observed scalar power spectrum on large scales in
discord with current data that favors a suppression on these scales. Scalar
fields are abundant in theories of quantum gravity. Considering a second scalar
field, its dynamics are dictated by the relation between its mass, $m$, and the
Hubble parameter, $H$, at different epochs in the history of the Universe. This
scalar field, a drainon, fulfills the conjecture draining up the swampland. For
Inflation, this drainon requires a modest hierarchy compared to the inflaton.
For the rest of the thermal history of the Universe, the drainon can be a

network at the lowest possible energy cost (sum of activation and switching

a Max-Weight algorithm along with a Lyapunov-based stability argument -- does
not suffice to show queue stability, essentially due to the temporal

properties of satellites and those of their central counterparts, identified by
matching the Vmax of their host haloes at the accretion time of the satellites.
Our model reproduces nicely the differences between centrals and satellites
measured for the HI mass, size of the star-forming region, and stellar radii.
In contrast, our model predicts larger differences with respect to data for the
molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By analysing the progenitors of
central and satellite model galaxies, we find that differences in the gas
content arise after accretion, and can be entirely ascribed to the
instantaneous stripping of the hot gas reservoir. The suppression of cold gas
replenishment via cooling and star formation leads to a reduction of the cold
gas and of its density. Therefore, more molecular gas is lost than lower
density HI gas, and model satellites have less molecular gas and lower star
formation rates than observed satellites. We argue that these disagreements
could be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for
ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas
reservoir. A more sophisticated treatment of angular momentum exchanges,
accounting for the multi-phase nature of the gaseous disc is also required.

$\lambda^{(\nu\nu\phi)}\bar\nu^c_R\nu_L\phi$ are then obtained as a special
case. In the presence of these interactions there can be new contributions to
the neutrino effective potential and index of refraction in the context of
neutrino collective oscillations in a supernova and in the Early Universe hot
plasma before neutrino decoupling. The formulas obtained here can be used to
estimate those effects and/or put limits on the model parameters based on the
contribution that such interactions can have in those contexts. A particular
feature of the results is that the contribution to the neutrino self-energy or
effective potential in a neutrino background due to the $\nu\nu\phi$ coupling
is proportional to the antineutrino-neutrino asymmetry $(n_{\bar\nu} -
n_{\nu})$, in contrast to the standard $Z$ contribution which is proportional
to $(n_{\nu} - n_{\bar\nu})$. Therefore the two contributions tend to cancel.
If the cancellation is significant, it is conceivable that the $O(1/m^4_\phi)$
terms give the dominant contribution. Alternatively, a limit can be set by
requiring that the contribution of the $\nu\nu\phi$ interaction to the neutrino
effective potential does not cancel the standard contribution in an appreciable
way.

parameter-varying (LPV) discrete-time state-space (SS) models with affine
dependence on the scheduling variable still remains an open question, as
identification methods proposed in the literature suffer heavily from the curse
of dimensionality and/or depend on over-restrictive approximations of the
measured signal behaviors. However, obtaining an SS model of the targeted
system is crucial for many LPV control synthesis methods, as these synthesis
tools are almost exclusively formulated for the aforementioned representation
of the system dynamics. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle the problem by
combining state-of-the-art LPV input-output (IO) identification methods with an
LPV-IO to LPV-SS realization scheme and a maximum likelihood refinement step.
The resulting modular LPV-SS identification approach achieves statical
efficiency with a relatively low computational load. The method contains the
following three steps: 1) estimation of the Markov coefficient sequence of the
underlying system using correlation analysis or Bayesian impulse response
estimation, then 2) LPV-SS realization of the estimated coefficients by using a
basis reduced Ho-Kalman method, and 3) refinement of the LPV-SS model estimate
from a maximum-likelihood point of view by a gradient-based or an
expectation-maximization optimization methodology. The effectiveness of the
full identification scheme is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo study where our
proposed method is compared to existing schemes for identifying a MIMO LPV
system.

elaborate saliency maps by enhancing local and global information of feature

enhanced by a recurrent structure which shared convolution kernel at different

a self-attention module, which generates different attention weights for

are. Curiously enough, when they are applied to random variables, they lead to
a notion of best predictor that coincides with usual best predictor in
Euclidean distance. Given a divergence function, we can derive from it a
Riemannian metric, which leads to a distance in which means and best predictors
do not coincide with their Euclidean counterparts. It is the purpose of this
note to study the Riemannian metric derived from the divergence function as
well as its use in prediction theory.

  time to death among dying ICU patients",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0212439",,"cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We considered observational data available from the MIMIC-III open-access ICU
database and collected within a study period between year 2002 up to 2011. If a
patient had multiple admissions to the ICU during the 30 days before death,
only the first stay was analyzed, leading to a final set of 6,436 unique ICU
admissions during the study period. We tested two hypotheses: (i)
administration of invasive intervention during the ICU stay immediately
preceding end-of-life would decrease over the study time period and (ii)
time-to-death from ICU admission would also decrease, due to the decrease in
invasive intervention administration. To investigate the latter hypothesis, we
performed a subgroups analysis by considering patients with lowest and highest
severity. To do so, we stratified the patients based on their SAPS I scores,
and we considered patients within the first and the third tertiles of the
score. We then assessed differences in trends within these groups between years
2002-05 vs. 2008-11.
  Comparing the period 2002-2005 vs. 2008-2011, we found a reduction in
endotracheal ventilation among patients who died within 30 days of ICU
admission (120.8 vs. 68.5 hours for the lowest severity patients, p<0.001; 47.7
vs. 46.0 hours for the highest severity patients, p=0.004). This is explained
in part by an increase in the use of non-invasive ventilation. Comparing the
period 2002-2005 vs. 2008-2011, we found a reduction in the use of vasopressors
and inotropes among patients with the lowest severity who died within 30 days
of ICU admission (41.8 vs. 36.2 hours, p<0.001) but not among those with the
highest severity. Despite a reduction in the use of invasive interventions, we
did not find a reduction in the time to death between 2002-2005 vs. 2008-2011
(7.8 days vs. 8.2 days for the lowest severity patients, p=0.32; 2.1 days vs.

equitable coloring called equitable choosability. A $k$-assignment, $L$, for a
graph $G$ assigns a list, $L(v)$, of $k$ available colors to each $v \in V(G)$,
and an equitable $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring, $f$, of $G$ such
that $f(v) \in L(v)$ for each $v \in V(G)$ and each color class of $f$ has size
at most $\lceil |V(G)|/k \rceil$. Graph $G$ is said to be equitably
$k$-choosable if an equitable $L$-coloring of $G$ exists whenever $L$ is a
$k$-assignment for $G$. In this note we study the equitable choosability of
complete bipartite graphs. A result of Kostochka, Pelsmajer, and West implies
$K_{n,m}$ is equitably $k$-choosable if $k \geq \max \{n,m\}$ provided $K_{n,m}
\neq K_{2l+1, 2l+1}$. We prove $K_{n,m}$ is equitably $k$-choosable if $m \leq

$k$-choosable for certain $k$ satisfying $k < \max \{n,m\}$. We also give a
complete characterization of the equitable choosability of complete bipartite
graphs that have a partite set of size at most 2.

technological or engineering roadblocks, or even rely on speculative unknown
science. In particular light of the recent public excitement and ensuing
disappointment regarding the exotic ""EM drive"" it is worthwhile to point out
that propellantless space travel is eminently possible based on well
established physical principles. Here a new mode of transport is proposed which
relies on electric-field moderated momentum exchange with the ionized particles
in the interstellar medium. The application of this mechanism faces significant
challenges requiring industrial-scale exploitation of space but the
technological roadblocks are different than those presented by light sails or
particle beam powered craft, and may be more easily addressed depending on the
uncertain march of technology. This mode of space travel is well suited to
energy efficient travel at velocities less than or of order 0.05c and compares
exceptionally well to light sails on an energy expenditure basis. It therefore
represents an extremely attractive mode of transport for slow (~multi-century
long) voyages carrying massive payloads to nearby stellar neighbors. This would
be useful for missions that would otherwise be too energy intensive to carry
out, such as transporting a generation ship or bulk materials for a future
colony around Alpha Cen A.

In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale artificial neural network for

allows us to efficiently approximate discretized nonlinear maps arising from
partial differential equations or integral equations. It also naturally extends
our recent work based on the generalization of hierarchical matrices [Fan et
al. arXiv:1807.01883] but with a reduced number of parameters. In particular,
the number of parameters of the neural network grows linearly with the
dimension of the parameter space of the discretized PDE. We demonstrate the
properties of the architecture by approximating the solution maps of non-linear
Schr{\""o}dinger equation, the radiative transfer equation, and the Kohn-Sham
map.

surface morphology of skin lesions. The sensor consists of a brass cylinder
with an axial bore. Three peripheral bobbins were machined in the cylinder
around which three coils have been wound. An iron core can easily move inside
the bore. One of the coils acts as primary and the other two are secondary
coils. Change in the position of the core due to surface peaks and valleys
causes the induced voltage in the secondary coils to vary. This change in the
voltage is a measure of core position and reveals the morphological features of
the surface (surface profile). Experiments show that the proposed sensor is
capable of discriminating between the models of two different types of skin
lesions, namely, anetoderma and nodule, which resemble each other in visual
inspection but behave differently when being touched. Thus, this sensor could
be used as an assist device for diagnosis purposes in teledermatology systems.

states of matter that behave like crystals in the manner in which they suppress
volume-fraction fluctuations at large length scales, and yet are statistically
isotropic with no Bragg peaks. It has recently been shown that disordered
hyperuniform dielectric two-dimensional cellular network solids possess
complete photonic band gaps comparable in size to photonic crystals, while at
the same time maintaining statistical isotropy, enabling waveguide geometries
not possible with photonic crystals. Motivated by these developments, we
explore other functionalities of various two-dimensional ordered and disordered
hyperuniform cellular networks, including their effective thermal or electrical
conductivities and elastic moduli. We establish the multifunctionality of a
class of such low-density networks by demonstrating that they maximize or
virtually maximize the effective conductivities and elastic moduli. This is
accomplished using the machinery of homogenization theory, including optimal
bounds and cross-property bounds, and statistical mechanics. We have identified
ordered and disordered hyperuniform low-weight cellular networks that are
multifunctional with respect to transport (e.g., heat dissipation and fluid
transport), mechanical and electromagnetic properties, which can be readily
fabricated using 3D printing and lithographic technologies.

glare happens would be helpful to prevent sun glare caused traffic accidents

Street View (GSV) panorama images to estimate and predict the occurrence of sun
glare. GSV images have view sight similar to drivers, which would make GSV
images suitable for estimating the visibility of sun glare to drivers. A
recently developed convolutional neural network algorithm was used to segment
GSV images and predict obstructions on sun glare. Based on the predicted
obstructions for given locations, we further estimated the time windows of sun
glare by estimating the sun positions and the relative angles between drivers
and the sun for those locations. We conducted a case study in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA. Results show that the method can predict the presence of
sun glare precisely. The proposed method would provide an important tool for
drivers and traffic planners to mitigate the sun glare and decrease the
potential traffic accidents caused by the sun glare.

how mathematics may be seen to be largely about 'information compression via
the matching and unification of patterns' (ICMUP). ICMUP is itself a novel
approach to information compression, couched in terms of non-mathematical
primitives, as is necessary in any investigation of the foundations of
mathematics. This new perspective on the foundations of mathematics has grown
out of an extensive programme of research developing the ""SP Theory of
Intelligence"" and its realisation in the ""SP Computer Model"", a system in which
a generalised version of ICMUP -- the powerful concept of SP-multiple-alignment
-- plays a central role. These ideas may be seen to be part of a ""Big Picture""
comprising six areas of interest, with information compression as a unifying
theme. The paper describes the close relation between mathematics and
information compression, and describes examples showing how variants of ICMUP
may be seen in widely-used structures and operations in mathematics. Examples
are also given to show how the mathematics-related disciplines of logic and
computing may be understood as ICMUP. There are many potential benefits and
applications of these ideas.
