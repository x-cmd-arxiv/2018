in time-series photometry, repeatedly covering their 5-6 hr orbital light
curves in $r^{\prime}$ or $R$. On timescales of months, PSR J1048+2339 and XMMU
J083850.38$-$282756.8 exhibit similar variability of $\approx0.3$ mag on the
heated side of the companion star. However, the heating light curve is rarely
symmetric, suggesting that the intrabinary shock generated by the pulsar wind
is skewed in addition to being variable, or that changing magnetic fields
intrinsic to the companion channel the pulsar wind. In addition to this
variable heating, there are long-lived flaring states that increase the
brightness by an additional 0.5 mag, with variability on $\approx10$ minute
timescales. These flares also appear to originate on the heated side of the
companion, while the ""night""-side brightness remains relatively stable.
Somewhat less active, PSR J1628$-$3205 has an optical light curve that is
dominated by tidal distortion (ellipsoidal modulation), although it too shows
evidence of variable and asymmetric heating due to shifting magnetic fields or
migrating star spots. These effects frustrate any effort to derive system
parameters such as inclination angle and Roche-lobe filling factor from optical
light curves of redback MSPs. We also report on two Chandra X-ray observations
of PSR J1048+2339 that show strong orbital modulation, possibly due to beaming
along the intrabinary shock, and a third observation that is dominated by
flaring. The peak flare luminosity in the 0.3-8 keV band is $\approx12\%$ of
the pulsar's spin-down power, which may require magnetic reconnection. None of
these three systems has yet shown a transition back to an accreting state.

During filtration, the system performance is dramatically affected by membrane
fouling which causes a significant decrease in permeate flux as well as an
increase in the energy input required to operate the system. Design and
optimization of ROM filtration systems aim at reducing membrane fouling by
studying the coupling between membrane structure, local flow field, local
solute concentration and foulant adsorption patterns. Yet, current studies
focus exclusively on oversimplified steady-state models that ignore any dynamic
coupling between the fluid dynamics and the transport through the membrane,
while membrane design still proceeds through trials and errors. In this work,
we develop a model that couples the transient Navier-Stokes and the
Advection-Diffusion-Equations, as well as an adsorption-desorption equation for
the foulant accumulation, and we validate it against unsteady measurements of
permeate flux as well as steady-state spatial fouling patterns. Furthermore, we
analytically show that, for a straight channel, a universal scaling
relationship exists between the Sherwood and Bejam numbers. We then generalize
this result to membranes subject to morphological and/or topological
modifications. We demonstrate that universal scaling behavior can be identified
through the definition of a modified Reynolds number, that accounts for the
additional length scales introduced by the membrane modifications, and a
membrane performance index, which represents an aggregate efficiency measure
with respect to both clean permeate flux and energy input required to operate
the system.

to a Lie group $G$, in the presence of a many-body environment this particle
can be described by a deformed group, $G_q$. Crucially, the single deformation
parameter, $q$, contains all the information about the many-particle
interactions in the system. We exemplify our approach by considering a quantum
rotor interacting with a bath of bosons, and demonstrate that extracting the
value of $q$ from closed-form solutions in the perturbative regime allows one
to predict the behavior of the system for arbitrary values of the impurity-bath
coupling strength, in good agreement with non-perturbative calculations.
Furthermore, the value of the deformation parameter allows to predict at which
coupling strengths rotor-bath interactions result in a formation of a stable
quasiparticle. The approach based on quantum groups does not only allow for a
drastic simplification of impurity problems, but also provides valuable
insights into hidden symmetries of interacting many-particle systems.

modeling and neural machine translation provide the justification and means

first taking the average of LSTM states across the sequence and secondly using
a bidirectional LSTM, both implementations serve to improve model performance

an exact reproduction of the baseline results proves unsuccessful. Despite

which effectively alleviates the backhaul burden and reduces response time. To
fully exploit edge storage resources, the most popular contents should be
identified and cached. Observing that user demands on certain contents vary
greatly at different locations, this paper devises location-customized caching
schemes to maximize the total content hit rate. Specifically, a linear model is
used to estimate the future content hit rate. For the case where the model
noise is zero-mean, a ridge regression based online algorithm with positive
perturbation is proposed. Regret analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm
asymptotically approaches the optimal caching strategy in the long run. When
the noise structure is unknown, an $H_{\infty}$ filter based online algorithm
is further proposed by taking a prescribed threshold as input, which guarantees
prediction accuracy even under the worst-case noise process. Both online
algorithms require no training phases, and hence are robust to the time-varying
user demands. The underlying causes of estimation errors of both algorithms are
numerically analyzed. Moreover, extensive experiments on real world dataset are
conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed algorithms. It is
demonstrated that those algorithms can be applied to scenarios with different
noise features, and are able to make adaptive caching decisions, achieving
content hit rate that is comparable to that via the hindsight optimal strategy.

effect estimator, but is by construction invalid for inference. Robust bias
corrected (RBC) inference methods are valid when using the MSE-optimal
bandwidth, but we show they yield suboptimal confidence intervals in terms of
coverage error. We establish valid coverage error expansions for RBC confidence
interval estimators and use these results to propose new inference-optimal
bandwidth choices for forming these intervals. We find that the standard
MSE-optimal bandwidth for the RD point estimator is too large when the goal is
to construct RBC confidence intervals with the smallest coverage error. We
further optimize the constant terms behind the coverage error to derive new
optimal choices for the auxiliary bandwidth required for RBC inference. Our
expansions also establish that RBC inference yields higher-order refinements
(relative to traditional undersmoothing) in the context of RD designs. Our main
results cover sharp and sharp kink RD designs under conditional
heteroskedasticity, and we discuss extensions to fuzzy and other RD designs,
clustered sampling, and pre-intervention covariates adjustments. The
theoretical findings are illustrated with a Monte Carlo experiment and an
empirical application, and the main methodological results are available in
\texttt{R} and \texttt{Stata} packages.

low-scale baryon number violation. This work presents first-principles

to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme, and studying excited state effects in

expected bounds from proposed neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments to
predictions of a specific model of post-sphaleron baryogenesis. Quantum
chromodynamics is found to predict at least an order of magnitude more events
in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments than previous estimates based on
the ""MIT bag model"" for fixed BSM parameters. Lattice artifacts and other

of linear discrete ill-posed problems in conjunction with Tikhonov
regularization and requires the estimation of a regularization parameter that
balances between the sizes of the fit to data function and the regularization
term. The unbiased predictive risk estimator is one suggested method for
finding the regularization parameter when the noise in the measurements is
normally distributed with known variance. In this paper we provide an algorithm
using the unbiased predictive risk estimator that automatically finds both the
regularization parameter and the number of terms to use from the singular value
decomposition. Underlying the algorithm is a new result that proves that the
regularization parameter converges with the number of terms from the singular

discrete Picard condition is satisfied for exact data and that noise completely
contaminates the measured data coefficients for a sufficiently large number of
terms, dependent on both the noise level and the degree of ill-posedness of the
system. A lower bound for the regularization parameter is provided leading to a
computationally efficient algorithm. Supporting results are compared with those

How the structure of the environment shapes the population front and the

we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of populations consisting of many
selectively neutral genotypes expanding on curved surfaces. Using a combination
of individual-based off-lattice simulations, geometrical arguments, and
lattice-based stepping-stone simulations, we characterise the effect of
individual bumps on an otherwise flat surface. Compared to the case of a range
expansion on a flat surface, we observe a transient relative increase, followed
by a decrease, in neutral genetic diversity at the population front. In
addition, we find that individuals at the sides of the bump have a dramatically
increased expected number of descendants, while their neighbours closer to the
bump's centre are far less lucky. Both observations can be explained using an
analytical description of straight paths (geodesics) on the curved surface.
Complementing previous studies of heterogeneous flat environments, the findings

use supervised-learning methods that rely on large amounts of data collected in

participants may suffer and even die as a result of having not received the
most appropriate treatments during the trial. Reinforcement-learning methods
improve the situation by making it possible to learn the treatment efficacies
dynamically during the course of the trial, and to adapt treatment assignments
accordingly. Recent efforts using \textit{multi-arm bandits}, a type of
reinforcement-learning methods, have focused on maximizing clinical outcomes
for a population that was assumed to be homogeneous. However, those approaches
have failed to account for the variability among participants that is becoming
increasingly evident as a result of recent clinical-trial-based studies. We
present a contextual-bandit-based online treatment optimization algorithm that,
in choosing treatments for new participants in the study, takes into account
not only the maximization of the clinical outcomes but also the patient
characteristics. We evaluated our algorithm using a real clinical trial dataset
from the International Stroke Trial. The results of our retrospective analysis
indicate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than either a
random assignment of treatments (the current gold standard) or a
multi-arm-bandit-based approach, providing substantial gains in the percentage
of participants who are assigned the most suitable treatments. The
contextual-bandit and multi-arm bandit approaches provide 72.63% and 64.34%

theories of gravity have received increased attention lately, motivated from
both theoretical and observational aspects. Gravitational wave observations
opened new possibilities for testing the viability of such theories in the
strong-field regime. One could test each theory against observed data one at a
time, though a more efficient approach would be to first probe gravity in a
theory-agnostic way and map such information to that on specific theories
afterward. One example of such model-independent tests with gravitational waves
is the parameterized post-Einsteinian formalism, where one introduces generic
parameters in the amplitude and phase that capture non-Einsteinian effects. In
this paper, we derive gravitational waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries
in various modified theories of gravity that violate at least one fundamental
pillar in general relativity. We achieve this by deriving relations between
corrections to the waveform amplitude/phase and those to the frequency
evolution and Kepler's third law, since the latter two have already been (or
can easily be) derived in many theories. Such an analysis allows us to derive
corrections to the waveform amplitude, which extends many of previous works
that focused on phase corrections only. Moreover, we derive gravitational
waveforms in theories with varying gravitational constant. We extend the
previous work by introducing two gravitational constants (the conservative one
entering in the binding energy and the dissipative one entering in the
gravitational wave luminosity) and allowing masses of binary constituents to
vary with time. We also correct some errors in previous literature. Our results
can be used to improve current analyses of testing general relativity as well
as to achieve new projected constraints on many modified theories of gravity.

mass spectrometry analyses utilize mean regression to detect spectral regions
that are differentially expressed across groups. However, given the
inter-patient heterogeneity that is a key hallmark of cancer, many biomarkers
are only present at aberrant levels for a subset of, not all, cancer samples.
Differences in these biomarkers can easily be missed by mean regression, but
might be more easily detected by quantile-based approaches. Thus, we propose a
unified Bayesian framework to perform quantile regression on functional
responses. Our approach utilizes an asymmetric Laplace working likelihood,
represents the functional coefficients with basis representations which enable
borrowing of strength from nearby locations, and places a global-local
shrinkage prior on the basis coefficients to achieve adaptive regularization.
Different types of basis transform and continuous shrinkage priors can be used
in our framework. A scalable Gibbs sampler is developed to generate posterior
samples that can be used to perform Bayesian estimation and inference while
accounting for multiple testing. Our framework performs quantile regression and
coefficient regularization in a unified manner, allowing them to inform each
other and leading to improvement in performance over competing methods as
demonstrated by simulation studies. We also introduce an adjustment procedure
to the model to improve its frequentist properties of posterior inference. We
apply our model to identify proteomic biomarkers of pancreatic cancer that are
differentially expressed for a subset of cancer patients compared to the normal
controls, which were missed by previous mean-regression based approaches.

finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, and uses the graphical calculus of string
diagrams to facilitate reasoning about finite dimensional processes. A
significant portion of quantum physics, however, involves reasoning about
infinite dimensional processes, and it is well-known that the category of all
Hilbert spaces is not compact closed. Thus, a limitation of using dagger
compact closed categories is that one cannot directly accommodate reasoning
about infinite dimensional processes.
  A natural categorical generalization of compact closed categories, in which
infinite dimensional spaces can be modelled, is *-autonomous categories and,
more generally, linearly distributive categories. This article starts the
development of this direction of generalizing categorical quantum mechanics. An
important first step is to establish the behaviour of the dagger in these more
general settings. Thus, these notes simultaneously develop the categorical
semantics of multiplicative dagger linear logic.
  The notes end with the definition of a mixed unitary category. It is this

environment for contagion processes such as the spread of pathogens. Empirical
evidence reveals a systematic increase in the rates of certain sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) with larger urban population size. However, the
main drivers of these systemic infection patterns are still not well
understood, and rampant urbanization rates worldwide makes it critical to
advance our understanding on this front. Using confirmed-cases data for three
STDs in US metropolitan areas, we investigate the scaling patterns of
infectious disease incidence in urban areas. The most salient features of these
patterns are that, on average, the incidence of infectious diseases that
transmit with less ease-- either because of a lower inherent transmissibility
or due to a less suitable environment for transmission-- scale more steeply
with population size, are less predictable across time and more variable across
cities of similar size. These features are explained, first, using a simple
mathematical model of contagion, and then through the lens of a new theory of
urban scaling. These theoretical frameworks help us reveal the links between
the factors that determine the transmissibility of infectious diseases and the
properties of their scaling patterns across cities.

coupled quark gluon plasma ( QGP ) and to play a role for chiral symmetry
breaking as well as quark confinement. We analyze monopole quark interactions
and show that massless quarks colliding with the monopoles inevitably change
their chiralities keeping their flavors. The monopole quark interaction
explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry ( SU$_A(2)\times $U$_A$(1) ) just like
bare quark masses. It is given by $\bar{q}q\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi$ with the
monopole field $\Phi$. The pions are not Nambu-Goldstone bosons even in the
vanishing bare quark masses. Their masses are mainly determined by the
interaction because the monopole condensation generates a larger current quark
mass than the bare quark masses. Based on the analysis of the monopole quark
interaction, we propose a phenomenological linear sigma model coupled with the
monopoles. The monopoles couple only with isoscalar scalar mesons e.g. sigma
meson $\sigma$ such as $\sigma\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi$ indicated by the monopole
quark interaction. The coupling explicitly breaks the chiral SU(2)$_A\times
$U$_A$(1) symmetry. Pion masses are generated by the chiral condensate, which
arises only when the monopole condensate takes place. We show that one of the
monopoles is a color singlet and observable. The monopole decays into hadrons (
pions, kaon, etc. ) through the coupling. Our analysis indicates that
$f_0(1500)$ meson is a candidate of the observable monopole. As
phenomenological effects of these monopoles, we point out that the masses of
hadrons decrease in dense nuclear matters and that chiral magnetic effects
disappear in strong coupled QGP.

transport lines. In the tunnel, space is reserved for a future pp collider,
SPPC. The CEPC center-of-mass energy is 240 GeV, and at that collision energy
will serve as a Higgs factory. The design also allows operation at 91 GeV for a
Z factory and at 160 GeV for a W factory. The heart of the CEPC is a
double-ring collider. It has two interaction points where are located large
detectors. The Booster is in the same tunnel above the Collider. It is a
synchrotron with a 10 GeV injection energy and extraction energy equal to the
beam collision energy. The repetition cycle is 10 seconds. Top-up injection
will be used to maintain constant luminosity. The 10 GeV Linac, injector to the
Booster, built at ground level, accelerates both electrons and positrons. A 1.1
GeV damping ring reduces the positron emittance. Transport lines made of
permanent magnets connect the Linac to the Booster. In addition to particle
physics, the Collider can operate simultaneously as a powerful synchrotron
radiation (SR) light source. It will extend the usable SR spectrum into an
unprecedented energy and brightness range. Two gamma-ray beamlines are included
in the design. Prior to the construction will be a five-year R&D period

firstly, the whole atoll shape of the CCD links the disk radius range of ~15.9
- 33.0 km, which is just located inside the corotation radius of 4U 1728-34
-r_co ( ~34.4 km), implying that the CCD shape is involved in the NS spin-up
state. Secondly, the island and banana states of CCD correspond to the two
particular boundaries: (I)-near the corotation radius at r ~27.2 - 33.0 km,
where the source lies in the island state; (II)-near the NS surface at r ~15.9
- 22.3 km, where the source lies in both the island and banana states. Thirdly,
the vertex of the atoll shape in CCD, where the radiation transition from the

measurements are routinely used to monitor the population relaxation dynamics
on the subpicosecond time scale, it is also known that the signal in the
negative delay can yield direct signatures of the
perturbed-free-induction-decay of polarization. Yet this technique, especially
in reflection geometry, has never been popular because the experiment is
conceptually not very intuitive. Coherent dynamics is therefore usually studied
using the more complex four-wave-mixing experiments. Here we derive from first
principles the simplest possible but mathematically complete framework for the
negative delay signal in both the time and the spectral domains. The
calculation involving the optical Bloch equations to describe the induced
polarization and the Ewald-Oseen idea to calculate the reflected signal as a
consequence of the free oscillations of perturbed dipoles, also explicitly
includes the process of lock-in detection of a double-chopped signal after it
has passed through a monochromator. The theory is compared with experiments on
high quality GaAs quantum well sample. The dephasing time inferred
experimentally at 4 K compares remarkably well with the inverse of the
absorption linewidth of the continuous-wave photoluminescence excitation
spectrum. Spectrally resolved signal at negative delay calculated from our
theoretical expression nicely reproduces the coherent spectral oscillations,
although exact fitting of the experimental spectra with the theoretical
expression is difficult. This is on account of additional resonances present in
the sample corresponding to lower energy bound states.

expressible in terms of the quantity $L_{X}g_{ab}$ it is possible to compute
the Lie derivative of all tensors defined by the metric i.e. the Ricci tensor,
the Weyl tensor etc. This makes possible the effects of any assumed
collineation on the gravitational field equations. This is done as follows.
Using relevant identities of Differential Geometry we express the quantity

irreducible parts $\psi,H_{ab}$. Subsequently using the gravitational field
equations we compute the same quantity $L_{X}R_{ab}$ in terms of the Lie
derivative of the dynamic variables. We equate the two results and find the
field equations in the form $L_{X}{\text{Dynamic

social, economical, and political systems. A computational and mathematical
framework to investigate consensus dynamics on complex networks is naming
games. In general, naming is not an independent process but relies on
perception and categorization. Existing works focus on consensus process of
vocabulary evolution in a population of agents. However, in order to name an
object, agents must first be able to distinguish objects according to their
features. We articulate a likelihood category game model (LCGM) to integrate
feature learning and the naming process. In the LCGM, self-organized agents can
define category based on acquired knowledge through learning and use likelihood
estimation to distinguish objects. The information communicated among the
agents is no longer simply in some form of absolute answer, but involves one's
perception. Extensive simulations with LCGM reveal that a more complex
knowledge makes it harder to reach consensus. We also find that agents with
larger degree contribute more to the knowledge formation and are more likely to
be intelligent. The proposed LCGM and the findings provide new insights into
the emergence and evolution of consensus in complex systems in general.

generation electronics and optoelectronics among the 2D family materials due to
its extraordinary electrical/optical/optoelectronic properties. Interestingly,
BP shows strong anisotropic transport behaviour because of its puckered
honeycomb structure. Previous studies have demonstrated the thermal transport
anisotropy of BP and theoretically attribute this to the anisotropy in both
phonon dispersion relation and phonon relaxation time. However, the exact
origin of such strong anisotropy lacks clarity and has yet to be proven
experimentally. In this work, we probe the thermal transport anisotropy of BP
nanoribbons (NRs) by an electron beam technique. We provide direct evidence
that the origin of this anisotropy is dominated by the anisotropic phonon group
velocity for the first time, verified by Young modulus measurements along
different directions. It turns out that the ratio of thermal conductivity
between zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) ribbons is almost same as that of the
corresponding Young modulus values. The results from first-principles
calculation are consistent with this experimental observation, where
anisotropic phonon group velocity between ZZ and AC is shown. Our results
provide fundamental insight into the anisotropic thermal transport in low

of such a situation, a new image identification scheme for double-compressed

extracted from only DC coefficients in DCT coefficients is used for the
identification. The use of the feature allows us not only to robustly avoid

requirement in untrusted relaying networks. Our considered system model
consists of one source, one destination, one untrusted relay, and one Willie.
The untrusted relay tries to extract the information signal, while the goal of
Willie is to detect the presence of the information signal transmitted by the
source, in the current time slot. To overcome these two attacks, we illustrate
that the destination and the source should inject jamming signal to the network
in phase I and phase II, respectively. Accordingly, the communication in our
proposed system model is accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, when
the source transmits its data to the untrusted relay the destination broadcasts
its jamming signal. In the second phase, when the relay retransmits the
received signal, the source transmits a jamming signal with one of its
antennas. For this system model, we propose a power allocation strategy to
maximize the instantaneous secrecy rate subject to satisfying the covert
requirements in both of the phases. Since the proposed optimization problem is
non-convex, we adopt the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach to
convert it to a convex optimization problem. Next, we extend our system model
to a practical system model where there are multiple untrusted relays and
multiple Willies under two scenarios of noncolluding Willies and colluding
Willies. Our findings highlight that unlike the direct transmission scheme, the
achievable secrecy rate of the proposed secure transmission scheme improve as
the number of untrusted relays increases.

some counterterms in the perturbed constraints cannot be uniquely fixed on the

in the perturbation equations. In this paper, we show that this problem can be
overcome by extending the anomaly-free algebra to the spatially closed

algebra can be obtained in the spatially closed case, and each counter term can
be uniquely fixed in terms of the inverse-volume correction functions; then, by
taking the large $r_o$ limit, we recover the anomaly-free Hamiltonian on the
spatially flat background. Using this Hamiltonian we obtain the gauge invariant
cosmological perturbations for scalar, vector and tensor modes in the spatially

  Machine Translation (WMT18), 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A popular application of machine translation (MT) is gisting: MT is consumed
as is to make sense of text in a foreign language. Evaluation of the usefulness
of MT for gisting is surprisingly uncommon. The classical method uses reading
comprehension questionnaires (RCQ), in which informants are asked to answer
professionally-written questions in their language about a foreign text that
has been machine-translated into their language. Recently, gap-filling (GF), a
form of cloze testing, has been proposed as a cheaper alternative to RCQ. In
GF, certain words are removed from reference translations and readers are asked
to fill the gaps left using the machine-translated text as a hint. This paper
reports, for thefirst time, a comparative evaluation, using both RCQ and GF, of
translations from multiple MT systems for the same foreign texts, and a
systematic study on the effect of variables such as gap density, gap-selection
strategies, and document context in GF. The main findings of the study are: (a)
both RCQ and GF clearly identify MT to be useful, (b) global RCQ and GF
rankings for the MT systems are mostly in agreement, (c) GF scores vary very
widely across informants, making comparisons among MT systems hard, and (d)
unlike RCQ, which is framed around documents, GF evaluation can be framed at
the sentence level. These findings support the use of GF as a cheaper
alternative to RCQ.

in a vehicle-to-vehicle communication network. The technical challenges lie in
high vehicle mobility and data traffic variations. Over the discrete scheduling
slots, each vehicle user equipment (VUE)-pair competes with other VUE-pairs in
the coverage of a road side unit (RSU) for the limited frequency to transmit
queued packets. The frequency allocation at the beginning of each slot by the
RSU is regulated following a sealed second-price auction. Each VUE-pair aims to
optimize the expected long-term performance. Such interactions among VUE-pairs
are modelled as a stochastic game with a semi-continuous global network state
space. By defining a partitioned control policy, we transform the stochastic
game into an equivalent game with a global queue state space of finite size. We
adopt an oblivious equilibrium (OE) to approximate the Markov perfect
equilibrium (MPE), which characterizes the optimal solution to the equivalent
game. The OE solution is theoretically proven to be with an asymptotic Markov
equilibrium property. Due to the lack of a priori knowledge of network
dynamics, we derive an online algorithm to learn the OE policies. Numerical
simulations validate the theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of the
proposed online learning algorithm.

GOODS-North field, with the aim to understand its physical properties of
stellar and dust emission, as well as the central AGN activity. Although it is
shown that the source is likely an extremely dusty galaxy at high redshift, its
exact position of submillimeter emission is unknown. With the new NOEMA
interferometric imaging, we confirm that the source is a unique dusty galaxy.
It has no obvious counterpart in the optical and even NIR images observed with
HST at lambda~<1.4um. Photometric-redshift analyses from both stellar and dust
SED suggest it to likely be at z~>4, though a lower redshift at z~>3.1 cannot
be fully ruled out (at 90% confidence interval). Explaining its unusual
optical-to-NIR properties requires an old stellar population (~0.67 Gyr),
coexisting with a very dusty ongoing starburst component. The latter is
contributing to the FIR emission, with its rest-frame UV and optical light
being largely obscured along our line of sight. If the observed fluxes at the
rest-frame optical/NIR wavelengths were mainly contributed by old stars, a
total stellar mass of ~3.5x10^11Msun would be obtained. An X-ray spectral
analysis suggests that this galaxy harbors a heavily obscured AGN with
N_H=3.3x10^23 cm^-2 and an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of L_X~2.6x10^44
erg/s, which places this object among distant type 2 quasars. The radio
emission of the source is extremely bright, which is an order of magnitude
higher than the star-formation-powered emission, making it one of the most
distant radio-luminous dusty galaxies. The combined characteristics of the
galaxy suggest that the source appears to have been caught in a rare but
critical transition stage in the evolution of submillimeter galaxies, where we
are witnessing the birth of a young AGN and possibly the earliest stage of its
jet formation and feedback.

report its long-term evolution in the X-ray flux and spectral variations over a
time-scale of ~decade, using both new and archival X-ray observations from the
XMM and Swift. The new Swift observations detected the source in its lowest
level of X-ray activity since outburst, a factor of ~4 lower in the 0.2-2 keV
flux than that obtained with the XMM observations nearly 8 years ago. Combining
with the historical X-ray measurements, we find that the X-ray flux is
decreasing slowly. There seemed to be spectral softening associated with the
drop of X-ray flux. In addition, we find evidence for the presence of a weak,
variable hard X-ray component, in addition to the dominant thermal blackbody
emission reported before. The long decay of X-ray flux and spectral evolution,
as well as the supersoft X-ray spectra, suggest that the source could be a
tidal disruption event, though a highly variable AGN cannot be fully ruled out.
Further continued X-ray monitoring would be required to test the TDE
interpretation, through better determining the flux evolution in the decay
phase.

we can map a node in $G_1$ to a node in $G_2$ whose distance vector to only a

action term non-trivial without the need to couple it to matter fields unlike
the case of ordinary D=4 Gauss-Bonnet gravity models. The non-Riemannian volume
element dynamically triggers the Gauss-Bonnet scalar to be an arbitrary
integration constant M on-shell, which in turn has several interesting
cosmological implications: (i) It yields specific solutions for the Hubble
parameter and the Friedmann scale factor as functions of time, which are
completely independent of the matter dynamics, i.e., there is no back reaction
by matter on the cosmological metric; (ii) For M>0 it predicts a
""coasting""-like evolution immediately after the Big Bang, and it yields a late
universe with dynamically produced dark energy density given through M; (iii)

Research on classroom networks has led to greater understandings of student
persistence in physics majors, changes in their career-related beliefs (e.g.,
physics interest), and their academic success. In this paper, we aim to provide
a practitioner's guide to carrying out research using SNA, including how to
develop data collection instruments, set up protocols for gathering data, as
well as identify network methodologies relevant to a wide range of research
questions beyond what one might find in a typical primer. We illustrate these
techniques using student anxiety data from active-learning physics classrooms.
We explore the relationship between students' physics anxiety and the social
networks they participate in throughout the course of a semester. We find that
students' with greater numbers of outgoing interactions are more likely to
experience negative anxiety shifts even while we control for {\it pre} anxiety,
gender, and final course grade. We also explore the evolution of student
networks and find that the second half of the semester is a critical period for
participating in interactions associated with decreased physics anxiety. Our
study further supports the benefits of dynamic group formation strategies that
give students an opportunity to interact with as many peers as possible
throughout a semester. To complement our guide to SNA in education research, we
also provide a set of tools for letting other researchers use this approach in

reliably recognizing faces across ages still remains a big challenge. The
appearance of a human face changes substantially over time, resulting in
significant intra-class variations. As opposed to current techniques for
age-invariant face recognition, which either directly extract age-invariant
features for recognition, or first synthesize a face that matches target age
before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both
tasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end, we propose a
deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three
distinct novelties. First, AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture
jointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual
boosting way. Second, AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with
remarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties, avoiding the
requirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third, we
develop effective and novel training strategies for end-to-end learning the
whole deep architecture, which generates powerful age-invariant face
representations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Moreover, we
propose a new large-scale Cross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) benchmark dataset
to facilitate existing efforts and push the frontiers of age-invariant face
recognition research. Extensive experiments on both our CAFR and several other
cross-age datasets (MORPH, CACD and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts. Benchmarking our model on one of
the most popular unconstrained face recognition datasets IJB-C additionally
verifies the promising generalizability of AIM in recognizing faces in the

of these wormholes depend upon the redshift and shape functions which are
defined in terms of radial coordinate. In literature, several shape functions
are defined and wormholes are studied in $f(R)$ gravity with respect to these
shape functions \cite{lobo, saiedi, baha}. In this paper, two shape functions
(i) $b(r)=\dfrac{{r_0} \log (r+1)}{\log ({r_0}+1)}$ and (ii)
$b(r)=r_0(\frac{r}{r_0})^\gamma$, $0<\gamma<1$ are considered. The first shape
function is newly defined, however the second one is collected from the
literature\cite{cataldo}. The wormholes are investigated for each type of shape
function in $f(R)$ gravity with $f(R)=R+\alpha R^m-\beta R^{-n}$, where $m$,
$n$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ are real constants. Varying parameters $\alpha$ or
$\beta$, $f(R)$ model is studied in five subcases for each type of shape
function. In each case, the energy density, radial \& tangential pressures,
energy conditions that include null energy condition, weak energy condition,
strong energy condition \& dominated energy condition, and anisotropic
parameter are computed. The energy density is found to be positive and all
energy conditions are obtained to be violated which supports the existence of
wormholes. Also, the equation of state parameter is obtained to possess values
less than -1, that shows the presence of the phantom fluid and leads towards
the expansion of the universe.

photonic transitions, a one-way beam splitting and amplification is exhibited
by the STM slab. Beam splitting is a vital operation for various optical and
photonic systems, ranging from quantum computation to fluorescence spectroscopy

the performance characteristics of beam splitters significantly influence the
repeatability and accuracy of the entire optical system. As of today, there has
been no approach exhibiting a nonreciprocal beam splitting accompanied with
transmission gain and an arbitrary splitting angle. Here, we show that oblique
illumination of a periodic and semi-coherent dynamically-modulated slab results
in coherent photonic transitions between the incident light beam and its
counterpart space-time harmonic (STH). Such photonic transitions introduce a
unidirectional synchronization and momentum exchange between two STHs with same
temporal frequencies, but opposite spatial frequencies. Such a beam splitting
technique offers high isolation, transmission gain and zero beam tilting, and
is expected to drastically decrease the resource and isolation requirements in

objects with uncertain shapes are needed in various applications ranging from
remote sensing at microwave frequencies to Raman spectroscopy at optical
frequencies. Often, such computational tools use the Monte Carlo (MC) method to
sample a parametric space describing geometric uncertainties. For each sample,
which corresponds to a realization of the geometry, a deterministic
electromagnetic solver computes the scattered fields. However, for an accurate
statistical characterization the number of MC samples has to be large. In this
work, to address this challenge, the continuation multilevel Monte Carlo
(CMLMC) method is used together with a surface integral equation solver. The
CMLMC method optimally balances statistical errors due to sampling of the
parametric space, and numerical errors due to the discretization of the
geometry using a hierarchy of discretizations, from coarse to fine. The number
of realizations of finer discretizations can be kept low, with most samples
computed on coarser discretizations to minimize computational cost.
Consequently, the total execution time is significantly reduced, in comparison
to the standard MC scheme.

may calculate the Hawking temperature and find the effect of the Lagrangian
density of BHs on the Hawking radiation. Therefore, a generalized uncertainty
principle (GUP) emerges from the modified Hawking temperature in Einstein-NED

  Length and Rigidity Required for Multivalent Binding of Antibodies to HIV-1
  Spikes",,,"10.1016/j.cels.2019.09.007",,"q-bio.BM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to the low density of envelope (Env) spikes on the surface of HIV-1,
neutralizing IgG antibodies rarely bind bivalently using both antigen-binding
arms (Fabs) to crosslink between spikes (inter-spike crosslinking), instead
resorting to weaker monovalent binding that is more sensitive to Env mutations.
Synthetic antibodies designed to bivalently bind a single Env trimer
(intra-spike crosslinking) were previously shown to exhibit increased
neutralization potencies. In initial work, diFabs joined by varying lengths of
rigid double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were considered. Anticipating future
experiments to improve synthetic antibodies, we investigate whether linkers
with different rigidities could enhance diFab potency by modeling DNA-Fabs
containing different combinations of rigid dsDNA and flexible single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) and characterizing their neutralization potential. Model
predictions suggest that while a long flexible polymer may be capable of
bivalent binding, it exhibits weak neutralization due to the large loss in
entropic degrees of freedom when both Fabs are bound. In contrast, the
strongest neutralization potencies are predicted to require a rigid linker that
optimally spans the distance between two Fab binding sites on an Env trimer,
and avidity can be further boosted by incorporating more Fabs into these
constructs. These results inform the design of multivalent anti-HIV-1
therapeutics that utilize avidity effects to remain potent against HIV-1 in the
face of the rapid mutation of Env spikes.

a single rod connected to a single ski plate. We studied the conditions for the
stable ski turn as functions of the linear velocity and the radius of the turn.
The solutions for the stable ski turn in our model do not require any extra
skier's movement to complete a stable circular turn. The solution may then give
the skier the most comfortable skiing method without any active movement to
control the ski. The generalized force supporting the point mass from the ski
plate was calculated. We obtained the force from the ground (rebound force)
without any geometrical structure of the ski plate. Adding an active movement
to the direction of the ski plate, the conditions for the stable ski turn were
also analyzed. Our result gives some insight for the skier who wants to develop
technique.

  Transition Metal Carbides with Enhanced Damage tolerance and Exceptional
  Thermal Properties",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multicomponent alloying has displayed extraordinary potential for producing
exceptional structural and functional materials. However, the synthesis of
single-phase, multi-principal covalent compounds remains a challenge. Here we
present a diffusion-controlled alloying strategy for the successful realization
of covalent multi-principal transition metal carbides (MPTMCs) with a single
face-centered cubic (FCC) phase. The increased interfacial diffusion promoted
by the addition of a nonstoichiometric compound leads to rapid formation of the
new single phase at much lower sintering temperature. Direct atomic-level
observations via scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that
MPTMCs are composed of a single phase with a random distribution of all
cations, which holds the key to the unique combinations of improved fracture
toughness, superior Vickers hardness, and extremely lower thermal diffusivity
achieved in MPTMCs. The present discovery provides a promising approach toward
the design and synthesis of next-generation high-performance materials.
