the gravitational field of a circularly polarized laser beam. The rotation
consists of a reciprocal part due to gravitational optical activity, and a
non-reciprocal part due to the gravitational Faraday effect. We discuss how to
distinguish the two effects: Letting light propagate back and forth between two
mirrors, the rotation due to gravitational optical activity cancels while the
rotation due to the gravitational Faraday effect accumulates. In contrast, the
rotation due to both effects accumulates in a ring cavity and a situation can
be created in which gravitational optical activity dominates. Such setups
amplify the effects by up to five orders of magnitude, which however is not
enough to make them measurable with state of the art technology. The effects
are of conceptual interest as they reveal gravitational spin-spin coupling in
the realm of classical general relativity, a phenomenon which occurs in
perturbative quantum gravity.

  Gestures",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problem of recognizing eating gestures by tracking
wrist motion. Eating gestures can have large variability in motion depending on
the subject, utensil, and type of food or beverage being consumed. Previous
works have shown viable proofs-of-concept of recognizing eating gestures in
laboratory settings with small numbers of subjects and food types, but it is
unclear how well these methods would work if tested on a larger population in
natural settings. As more subjects, locations and foods are tested, a larger
amount of motion variability could cause a decrease in recognition accuracy. To
explore this issue, this paper describes the collection and annotation of
51,614 eating gestures taken by 269 subjects eating a meal in a cafeteria.
Experiments are described that explore the complexity of hidden Markov models
(HMMs) and the amount of training data needed to adequately capture the motion
variability across this large data set. Results found that HMMs needed a
complexity of 13 states and 5 Gaussians to reach a plateau in accuracy,
signifying that a minimum of 65 samples per gesture type are needed. Results
also found that 500 training samples per gesture type were needed to identify
the point of diminishing returns in recognition accuracy. Overall, the findings
provide evidence that the size a data set typically used to demonstrate a
laboratory proofs-of-concept may not be sufficiently large enough to capture
all the motion variability that could be expected in transitioning to
deployment with a larger population. Our data set, which is 1-2 orders of
magnitude larger than all data sets tested in previous works, is being made
publicly available.

classes of multistage adaptive optimization problems. Recent literature has
shown the promise of using linear and nonlinear decision rules in which
wait-and-see decisions are represented as functions, whose parameters are
decision variables to be optimized, of the underlying uncertain parameters.
Despite this growing success, solving real-world stochastic optimization
problems can become computationally prohibitive when using nonlinear decision
rules, and in some cases, linear ones. Consequently, decision rules that offer
a competitive trade-off between solution quality and computational time become
more attractive. Whereas the extant research has always used homogeneous
decision rules, the major contribution of this paper is a computational
exploration of hybrid decision rules. We first verify empirically that having
higher uncertainty resolution or more linear pieces in early stages is more
significant than having it in late stages in terms of solution quality. Then we
conduct a comprehensive computational study for non-increasing (i.e., higher
uncertainty resolution in early stages) and non-decreasing (i.e., higher
uncertainty resolution in late stages) hybrid decision rules to illustrate the
trade-off between solution quality and computational cost. We also demonstrate
a case where a linear decision rule is superior to a piecewise-linear decision
rule within a simulator environment, which supports the need to assess the
quality of decision rules obtained from a look-ahead model within a simulator
rather than just using the look-ahead model's objective function value.

of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities,
marginal rates of substitution (MRS), and heterogeneous values of time (VOT).
Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn the utility function and reveal
behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts. However, the
economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable because of the three
challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to
hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. To
demonstrate the strength and challenges of DNNs, we estimated the DNNs using a
stated preference survey, extracted the full list of economic information from
the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the
economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more
reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or
trainings, and that even simple hyperparameter searching can significantly
improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs.
Future studies should investigate other regularizations and DNN architectures,
better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address
DNNs' three challenges, to provide more reliable economic information from
DNN-based choice models.

they do not pay much attention to interactions among elements of a software. An
element is simply a callable code snippet such as a method or even a clickable
button. As a result, these approaches cannot be applied to event-driven
programs, such as Android applications, because they have specific features
such as numerous interactions between their elements. To tackle this problem,
we propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks and dynamic call
graphs to generate summaries for methods of event-driven programs. First, we
collect a set of comment/code pairs from Github and train a deep neural network
on the set. Afterward, by exploiting a dynamic call graph, the Pagerank
algorithm, and the pre-trained deep neural network, we generate summaries. An
empirical evaluation with 14 real-world Android applications and 42
participants indicates 32.3% BLEU4 which is a definite improvement compared to
the existing state-of-the-art techniques. We also assessed the informativeness

Specifically, the rms fluctuations $\sqrt {<(\delta N)^2>}$ of the number $N$
of active particles in a region containing a mean number of active particles
$<N>$ scales according to the law $\sqrt {<(\delta N)^2>} = K'<N>^{\phi(d)}$

much larger the ""law of large numbers"" scaling $\sqrt {<(\delta N)^2>} =
K\sqrt{<N>}$ found in most equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. In further
contrast to most other systems, the coefficient $K'$ also depends singularly on
the shape of the box in which one counts the particles, vanishing in the limit
of very thin boxes. These fluctuations arise {\it not} from large density
fluctuations - indeed, the density fluctuations in \dry s are not in general
particularly large - but from long ranged spatial correlations between those
fluctuations. These are shown to be closely related in two spatial dimensions
to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing conducting wedge of
opening angle ${3\pi\over8}=67.5^\circ$, and in three dimensions to the
electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing charged cone of opening

alternative box counting experiments that directly measure this density-density

causing them to deform and attain non-spherical shapes. The planet shapes,
modeled here as triaxial ellipsoids, can have an impact on the observed transit
light curves and the planetary parameters derived. We investigate the
detectability of tidal deformation in short-period planets from their transit
light curves and the instrumental precision needed. We show how the detection
of deformation from the light curve allows us to obtain an observational
estimate of the second fluid Love number which gives valuable insight about the
planet's internal structure. We adopted a model to calculate the shape of a
planet due to the external potentials acting on it and used this model to
modify the ellc transit tool. Our model is parameterized by the Love number,
hence for a given light curve we can derive the value of the Love number that
best matches the observations. We simulated the known cases of WASP-103b and
WASP-121b expected to be highly deformed. Our analyses showed that instrumental
precision $\leq$50ppm/min is needed to reliably estimate the Love number and
detect tidal deformation. This precision can be achieved for WASP-103b in ~40
transits using HST and in ~300 transits using the forthcoming CHEOPS. However,
fewer transits will be required for short-period planets that may be found
around bright stars in the TESS and PLATO survey missions. The unprecedented
precisions expected from PLATO and JWST can permit the detection of deformation
with a single transit. However, the effects of instrumental and astrophysical
noise must be well-considered as they can increase the number of transits
required to reach the 50 ppm/min detection limit. We also show that improper
modeling of limb darkening can act to bury signals related to the planet's
shape thereby leading us to infer sphericity for a deformed planet.

dynamical system. The PF framework is applied on two benchmarks, networks of
Kuramoto and R\""ossler oscillators, to investigate how the interplay between
dynamics and topology impacts the network observability. Based on the numerical
results, we conjecture that, when the network nodal dynamics are heterogeneous,
better observability is conveyed for sets of sensor nodes that share some
dynamical affinity to its neighbourhood. Moreover, we also investigate how the
choice of an internal measured variable of a multidimensional sensor node
affects the PF performance. The PF framework effectiveness as an observability

hyperbolic polaritons can be drastically modified by changing the orientation
of the crystal's anisotropy axis with respect to its surface. We demonstrate,
both theoretically and experimentally, phenomena associated with the
orientation of hyperbolic media. We show the consequences of slight changes in
the crystal's orientation in various ways, from the creation of hyperbolic
surface phonon-polaritons to the demonstration of oriented asymmetric
transmission of radiation passing through a hyperbolic medium.

eigen-spectrum as well as their fine explicit approximations using rational

noise and time delay in a platoon imposes some idiosyncratic limitations on the
behavior of collision and detachment risks, for instance, weakening (improving)
network connectivity may result in lower (higher) levels of risk. Furthermore,
a thorough risk analysis and comparison have been conducted for networks with

generation of realistic turbulence at inflow boundaries is crucial for the
accuracy of a simulation. The Control Forced Concurrent Precursor Method
(CFCPM) proposed in this work combines an existing concurrent precursor method
and a mean flow forcing method with a new extension of the controlled forcing
method to impose turbulent inflow boundary conditions primarily, although not
exclusively, for domains that require periodic boundary conditions. Turbulent
inflow boundary conditions are imposed through a region of body forces added to
the momentum equations of the main simulation that transfers the precursor
simulation into the main domain. Controlled forcing planes, which come into
play as body forces added to the momentum equations on planes perpendicular to
the flow, located in the precursor simulation, allow for specific Reynolds
stress tensors and mean velocities to be imposed. The mean flow controlled
forcing method only modifies the mean velocity profiles, leaving the
fluctuating velocity field untouched. The proposed fluctuating flow controlled
forcing methods extends the application of the original controlled forcing
method to multiple fluctuating velocity components and couples their
calculation in order to amplify the existing fluctuations present in the
precursor flow field so that prescribed anisotropic Reynolds stress tensors can
be reproduced. The new method was tested on high Reynolds number turbulent
boundary layer flow over a wall-mounted cube and low Reynolds number turbulent
boundary layer flow over a backward-facing step. It was found that the new
extension of the controlled forcing method reduced the development time for
both test cases considered here when compared to not using controlled forcing
and only using the original controlled forcing method.

handling while Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) is a proven tool for
characterising (macro-)molecular structures. In combination those two
techniques enable investigations of fast reactions with high time resolution
(<1 ms). The goal of combining a micro mixer with SAXS, however, puts
constraints on the materials and production methods used in the device
fabrication. The measurement channel of the mixer needs good x-ray transparency
and a low scattering background. While both depend on the material used, the
requirement for low scattering especially limits the techniques suitable for
producing the mixer, as the fabrication process can induce molecular
orientations and stresses that can adversely influence the scattering signal.
Not only is it important to find a production method that results in a device
with low background scattering, but it also has to be versatile enough to
produce appropriate mixer designs. Here we discuss two methods - laser ablation
of polycarbonate and injection moulding of Topas - which were found suitable
for our needs, provided care is taken in aligning the mixing/reaction channel,
where the actual measurements will be carried out. We find injection moulding
to be the better of the two methods.

class of algorithms where the input data are subjected to a data-independent
unitary transform followed by a power normalization stage as preprocessing
steps. Because conventional transformations are not data-dependent, this
preconditioning procedure was shown theoretically to improve the convergence of
the LMS filter only for certain classes of input data. However, in reality if
the class of input data is not known beforehand, it is difficult to decide
which transformation to use. Thus, there is a need to devise a learning
framework to obtain such a preconditioning transformation using input data
prior to applying on the input data. It is hypothesized that the underlying
topology of the data affects the selection of the transformation. With the
input modeled as a weighted graph that mimics neuronal interactions, PrecoG
obtains the desired transform by recursive estimation of the graph Laplacian
matrix. Additionally, we show the efficacy of the transform as a generalized
split preconditioner on a linear system of equations and in Hebb-LMS settings.
In terms of the improvement of the condition number after applying the
transformation, PrecoG performs significantly better than the existing
state-of-the-art techniques that involve unitary and non-unitary transforms.

0.3 $\pm$ 0.04) is observed between the Nusselt number (dimensionless heat

the computation and storage resources on vehicles for computational service

framework. In this paper, we investigate timely service provisioning for
deadline-constrained tasks in VCC systems by leveraging the task replication
technique (i.e., allowing one task to be executed by several server vehicles).
A learning-based algorithm, called DATE-V (Deadline-Aware Task rEplication for
Vehicular Cloud), is proposed to address the special issues in VCC systems
including uncertainty of vehicle movements, volatile vehicle members, and large
vehicle population. The proposed algorithm is developed based on a novel
Contextual-Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CC-MAB) learning framework. DATE-V
is `contextual' because it utilizes side information (context) of vehicles and
tasks to infer the completion probability of a task replication under random
vehicle movements. DATE-V is `combinatorial' because it aims to replicate the
received task and send the task replications to multiple server vehicles to
guarantee the service timeliness. We rigorously prove that our learning
algorithm achieves a sublinear regret bound compared to an oracle algorithm
that knows the exact completion probability of any task replications.
Simulations are carried out based on real-world vehicle movement traces and the
results show that DATE-V significantly outperforms benchmark solutions.

these strings is very similar to Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices, they are
defined with a characteristic size modulus, much like the instanton lump size.
This entails that the constituting fields of the vortex do not decay
exponentially, as one goes far away from the core of the string, but as a
rational function. The appearance of an extra scale in the problem also allows
for an explicit, analytic, approximate solution to be written for the BPS
equation, surprisingly.
  Despite the conceptually large differences between semi-local and non-Abelian
vortices, it appears that the moduli structures have one main common feature,
both undergo the same kind of heterotic deformation when a supersymmetry
breaking potential term is added to the spacetime theory, moving from
$\mathcal{N}=2$ to $\mathcal{N}=1$.
  By adding a mass term for the gauge scalar multiplet, a heterotic deformation
develops on the worldsheet, which breaks supersymmetry down to $(0,2)$ by
coupling supertranslational fermionic zero modes to supersize ones. Such an
interaction between zero modes of two different sectors was already
hypothesized and subsequently found for non-Abelian strings, providing a neat
way of circumventing accidental supersymmetry enhancement via Zumino's theorem.
We find that, for small values of the spacetime mass term, an entirely
analogous term develops on the worldsheet of semi-local strings.

driven by three control lasers--at the cavity resonance and at the two
mechanical sidebands--that couple the amplitude of the cavity field to the
resonator's position and position squared. When the amplitude of the resonant
drive is tuned to some specific values, the mechanical steady state is found in
a (displaced) superposition of a finite number of Fock states, which for large

on the Sun on Sept. 06, 2017, providing a rare exceptional opportunity to study
the mechanisms responsible for the formation of the magnetic field
configurations suitable for the manifestation of such yet enigmatic eruptive
events and their effects in the lower layers of the solar atmosphere.
  Using photospheric vector magnetograms, taken before the beginning of the two
X-class events, as boundary conditions to reconstruct the non$-$linear coronal
magnetic field configuration, we identified two related 3D null points located
at low heights above the photosphere (i.e. in very low corona). These null
points are most likely responsible for the triggering of the two strong X-GOES
class flares. We deduced that their formation at such low altitudes may
plausibly be ascribed to the peculiar photospheric horizontal motions of the
main magnetic structures of the hosting Active Region NOAA 12673.
  These events can be adopted as a hint for a possible interpretation of the
activity of young G-type stars, recently reported by the Kepler mission. We
argued that a possible explanation of the acceleration of huge numbers of
particles producing white light emission, during the Sept. 6 events as well as
during white light flares in young Sun-like stars, might be attributed to the
special accompanying conditions of the occurrence of magnetic reconnection at
low altitudes of their atmospheres.

profiles of pressure and jet width, and conserves matter and energy, enabling
us to estimate jet velocities, and hence all the other flow properties.
Invoking realistic stellar populations within the jet, we find that the
increase in its momentum flux exceeds the net pressure force on the jet unless

independence of QIMs is flawed, and suggest a new definition. Our study is
motivated by the PXP model -- a model of $N$ spins $1/2$ possessing an
extensive number of binary QIMs. The number of QIMs which are independent
according to the common definition turns out to be equal to the number of
spins, $N$. A common wisdom would then suggest that the system is completely

survey to identify regions in which the gas-phase metallicity is
anomalously-low compared to expectations from the tight empirical relation
between metallicity and stellar surface mass-density at a given stellar mass.
We find anomalously low metallicity (ALM) gas in 10% of the star-forming
spaxels, and in 25% of the galaxies in the sample. The incidence rate of ALM
gas increases strongly with both global and local measures of the specific
star-formation rate, and is higher in lower mass galaxies and in the outer

morphologically disturbed galaxies. We estimate that the lifetimes of the ALM

its present location by a combination of interactions, mergers, and accretion
from the halo, and that this infusion of gas stimulates star-formation. Given
the estimated lifetime and duty cycle of such events, we estimate that the
time-averaged accretion rate of ALM gas is similar to the star-formation rate

formation ($f_q$) is broadly observed to increase with increasing stellar mass,
increasing galaxy density, and decreasing redshift, with clear differences
observed in $f_q$ between field and group/cluster galaxies at the highest
redshifts studied. We use a semi-empirical model to generate mock group/cluster
galaxies unaffected by environmental processes and compare them to observed
populations to constrain the environmental quenching efficiency
($\Psi_{convert}$). High-density environments from $0.55 \le z \le 1.4$ appear
capable of efficiently quenching galaxies with
$\log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})>10.45$. Lower stellar mass galaxies also appear
efficiently quenched at the lowest redshifts, but this efficiency drops
precipitously with increasing redshift. Quenching efficiencies, combined with
simulated group/cluster accretion histories and results from a companion ORELSE
study, are used to constrain the average time from group/cluster accretion to
quiescence and the time between accretion and the inception of quenching. These
timescales were constrained to be <$t_{convert}$>=$2.4\pm0.3$ and

background, the baryon content of the high-redshift Universe can be precisely
determined. However, at low redshift, about one-third of the baryons remain
unaccounted for, which poses the long-standing missing baryon problem. The
missing baryons are believed to reside in large-scale filaments in the form of
warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this work, we employ a novel stacking
approach to explore the hot phases of the WHIM. Specifically, we utilize the
470 ks Chandra LETG data of the luminous quasar, H1821+643, along with previous
measurements of UV absorption line systems and spectroscopic redshift
measurements of galaxies toward the quasar's sightline. We repeatedly blueshift
and stack the X-ray spectrum of the quasar corresponding to the redshifts of
the 17 absorption line systems. Thus, we obtain a stacked spectrum with $8.0$
Ms total exposure, which allows us to probe X-ray absorption lines with
unparalleled sensitivity. Based on the stacked data, we detect an OVII
absorption line that exhibits a Gaussian line profile and is statistically
significant at the $3.3 \sigma$ level. Since the redshifts of the UV absorption
line systems were known a priori, this is the first definitive detection of an
X-ray absorption line originating from the WHIM. The equivalent width of the
OVII line is $(4.1\pm1.3) \ \mathrm{m\AA}$, which corresponds to an OVII column
density of $(1.4\pm0.4)\times10^{15} \ \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We constrain the
absorbing gas to have a density of $n_{\rm H} = (1-2)\times10^{-6} \
\rm{cm^{-3}}$ for a single WHIM filament. We derive $\Omega_{\rm b} \rm(O\,VII)
= (0.0023 \pm 0.0007) \, \left[ f_{O\,VII} \, {Z/Z_{\odot}} \right]^{-1}$ for
the cosmological mass density of OVII, assuming that all 17 systems contribute
equally.

companion masses between redbacks and the less massive black widows continues
to be strongly bimodal, which is an important constraint on evolutionary models

(CDM) model that alleviates its dwarf-scale challenges. We show how galaxies in
this model form differently to CDM on a halo-by-halo basis, at redshifts
$z\ge6$. We show that ETHOS haloes at the half-mode mass scale form with
50~per~cent less mass than their CDM counterparts due to their later formation
times, yet they retain more of their gas reservoir due to the different
behaviour of gas and dark matter during the monolithic collapse of the first
haloes in models with a galactic-scale cutoff. As a result, galaxies in ETHOS
haloes near the cutoff scale grow rapidly between $z=10-6$ and by $z=6$ end up
having very similar stellar masses, higher gas fractions and higher star
formation rates relative to their CDM counterparts. We highlight these
differences by making predictions for how the number of galaxies with old

population of dwarf galaxies hosting AGN, which have been confirmed by X-ray
follow-up observations. Recently, the MaNGA survey identified six dwarf
galaxies that appear to have an AGN that is preventing on-going star formation.
It is therefore timely to study the physical properties of dwarf galaxies, in
particular whether the presence of an AGN can affect their evolution. Using the
moving mesh code AREPO, we have investigated different models of AGN activity,
ranging from simple energy-driven spherical winds to collimated, mass-loaded,
bipolar outflows in high resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies
hosting an active black hole. Our simulations also include a novel
implementation of star formation and mechanical supernova (SN) feedback. We
find that AGN outflows have a small but systematic effect on the central star
formation rates (SFRs) for all set-ups explored, while substantial effects on
the global SFR are only obtained with strong SNe and a sustained
high-luminosity AGN with an isotropic wind. This suggests that AGN feedback in
dwarf galaxies is unlikely to directly regulate their global SFRs. There is,
however, a significant effect on outflow properties, which are notably enhanced
by the AGN to much higher outflow temperatures and velocities, in agreement
with kinematic signatures from the MaNGA survey. This indicates that AGN may
play an indirect role in regulating the baryon cycle in dwarf galaxies by
hindering cosmic gas inflows.

`quantizing gravity', resulting in a theory of `quantum gravity'. The opposite
approach is `gravitizing QT' where we attempt to keep the principles of GR,
such as the equivalence principle, and consider how this leads to modifications
of QT. What we are most lacking in understanding which route to take, if
either, is experimental guidance. Here we consider using a Bose-Einstein

in a superposition of two locations could test a gravitizing QT proposal where
wavefunction collapse emerges from a unified theory as an objective process,
resolving the measurement problem of QT. Such a modification to QT due to
general relativistic principles is testable near the Planck mass scale, which
is much closer to experiments than the Planck length scale where quantum,
general relativistic effects are traditionally anticipated in quantum gravity
theories. Furthermore, experimental tests of this proposal should be simpler to

parameters and intergalactic medium astrophysics, which are forecast to improve
further with the next generation of surveys including eBOSS and DESI. As is
generic in cosmological inference, extracting this information requires a
likelihood to be computed throughout a high-dimensional parameter space.
Evaluating the likelihood requires a robust and accurate mapping between the
parameters and observables, in this case the 1D flux power spectrum.
Cosmological simulations enable such a mapping, but due to computational time
constraints can only be evaluated at a handful of sample points; ""emulators""
are designed to interpolate between these. The problem then reduces to placing
the sample points such that an accurate mapping is obtained while minimising
the number of expensive simulations required. To address this, we introduce an
emulation procedure that employs Bayesian optimisation of the training set for
a Gaussian process interpolation scheme. Starting with a Latin hypercube
sampling (other schemes with good space-filling properties can be used), we
iteratively augment the training set with extra simulations at new parameter
positions which balance the need to reduce interpolation error while focussing
on regions of high likelihood. We show that smaller emulator error from the
Bayesian optimisation propagates to smaller widths on the posterior
distribution. Even with fewer simulations than a Latin hypercube, Bayesian
optimisation shrinks the 95% credible volume by 90% and, e.g., the 1 sigma
error on the amplitude of small-scale primordial fluctuations by 38%. This is
the first demonstration of Bayesian optimisation applied to large-scale
structure emulation, and we anticipate the technique will generalise to many
other probes such as galaxy clustering, weak lensing and 21cm.

as structural units, and we show that this block structure leads to a
coexistence of flat and dispersive energy bands, corresponding to localised and
delocalised electronic states. Electrons localise in orbitals spanning multiple
niobium sites in the plane of the blocks. Localised and delocalised electronic
states are both effectively one-dimensional and are partitioned between
different types of niobium sites. Flat bands associated with localised
electrons are present even at the GGA level, but a correct description of the
localisation requires the use of GGA+U or hybrid functionals. We discuss the

added to existing localised electrons. We propose that this behaviour of shear
phases is general for any type of $n$-doping, and should transfer to doping by
alkali metal (lithium) ions during operation of niobium oxide-based battery
electrodes. Future directions for theory and experiment on mixed-metal shear
phases are suggested.

0.9 using data drawn from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale
Environments (ORELSE) survey. We find that SFR does depend on environment, but
only for intermediate-stellar mass galaxies (10^10.1 < M* / Msol < 10^10.8)
wherein the median SFR at the highest densities is 0.2-0.3 dex less than at
lower densities at a significance of 4 sigma. Interestingly, mass does not
drive SFR; galaxies that are more/less massive have SFRs that vary at most by
~20% across all environments showing no statistically significant dependence.
We further split galaxies into low-redshift (z ~ 0.8) and high-redshift (z ~
1.05) subsamples and observe nearly identical behavior. We devise a simple toy
model to explore possible star-formation histories (SFHs) for galaxies evolving
between these redshifts. The key assumption in this model is that star-forming
galaxies in a given environment-stellar mass bin can be described as a
superposition of two exponential timescales (SFR ~ e^(-t/tau)): a long-tau
timescale with tau = 4 Gyr to simulate ""normal"" star-forming galaxies, and a
short-tau timescale with free tau (between 0.3 < tau/Gyr < 2) to simulate
galaxies on a quenching trajectory. In general we find that galaxies residing
in low/high environmental densities are more heavily weighted to the
long-tau/short-tau pathways respectively, which we argue is a signature of
environmental quenching. Furthermore, for intermediate-stellar mass galaxies
this transition begins at intermediate-density environments suggesting that
environmental quenching is relevant in group-like halos and/or cluster infall
regions.

information, particularly about the matter distribution in lensing galaxies and
the physical properties of the current universe, in general. Here, we analyse
the multifractal (nonlinear) behaviour of the optical observations of A and B
images of Q0957+561 in the $r$ and $g$ bands. AIMS: To verify the presence, or
absence, of extrinsic variations in the observed signals of the quasar images
and investigate whether extrinsic variations affect the multifractal behaviour
of their intrinsic signals. METHOD: We apply a wavelet transform modulus
maxima-based multifractality analysis approach. RESULTS: We detect strong
multifractal (nonlinear) signatures in the light curves of the quasar images.
The degree of multifractality for both images in the $r$ band changes over time
in a non-monotonic way, possibly indicating the presence of extrinsic
variabilities in the light curves of the images, i.e., the signals of the
quasar images are a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic signals.
Additionally, in the r band, in periods of quiescent microlensing activity, we
find that the degree of multifractality (nonlinearity) of image A is stronger
than that of B, while B has a larger multifractal strength in recent epochs
(from day 5564 to day 7527) when it appears to be affected by microlensing.
Finally, comparing the optical bands in a period of quiescent microlensing
activity, we find that the degree of multifractality is stronger in the $r$
band for both quasar images. In the absence of microlensing, the observed
excesses of nonlinearity are most likely generated when the broad-line region
(BLR) reprocesses the radiation from the compact sources.

emission lines show strong variability from epoch to epoch and, in particular,
during the early stages are found embedded into deep and very broad absorption
features. The quiescent spectrum shows H$\alpha$ in emission and no obvious
signatures of the donor star. XMM-Newton and Swift spectra can be fitted with
standard X-ray models for accreting black-holes and neutron stars, although the

neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole (NS-BH), are likely progenitors of
short-duration gamma ray bursts (SGRBs). A fraction >20% of SGRBs are followed
by temporally-extended (>~ minute-long), variable X-ray emission, attributed to
ongoing activity of the central engine. One source of late-time engine activity
is fall-back accretion of bound tidal ejecta; however, observed extended
emission light curves do not track the naively-anticipated, uninterrupted
~t^{-5/3} power-law decay, instead showing a lull or gap in emission typically
lasting tens of seconds after the burst. Here, we re-examine the impact of
heating due to rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis on rate of the
fall-back accretion, using ejecta properties obtained from numerical relativity
simulations of NS-BH mergers in a toy model for the dynamical influence of
nuclear heating. Depending on the mass of the remnant black hole, r-process
heating can imprint a variety of fall-back curve shapes, ranging from temporal
lulls of up to tens of seconds to complete late-time cut-off in the fall-back
rate. This behavior is robust to realistic variations in the nuclear heating
experienced by different parts of the ejecta. Central black holes with masses
<~ 3 Msun typically experience absolute cut-offs in the fall-back rate, while
more massive >6-8 Msun black holes instead show temporal gaps. We thus propose
that SGRBs with extended emission arise from NS-BH, rather than NS-NS, mergers.
Our model implies a NS-BH merger detection rate by LIGO which, in steady-state,
is comparable to or greater than that of NS-NS mergers.

input image to yield a different tissue contrast of the output image. This
process has been shown to have application in many medical image analysis tasks

the intensities of the input images are typically scaled--i.e.,
normalized--both in training to learn the transformation and in testing when
applying the transformation, but it is not presently known what type of input
scaling is optimal. In this paper, we consider seven different intensity
normalization algorithms and three different synthesis methods to evaluate the
impact of normalization. Our experiments demonstrate that intensity
normalization as a preprocessing step improves the synthesis results across all

intensity normalization is vital for successful deep learning-based MR image

that the total cooling budget through atomic carbon has not strongly changed in
the last 12 Gyr. Both lines are optically thin and trace 1 - 6 x 10^7 M_sun of
atomic carbon. Carbon abundance ratios with H_2, X_CI, are between 2.5 and 4 x

Interpolation is necessary for cosmological parameter estimation due to the

Latin hypercube sampling and Gaussian process interpolation. We show that this
emulator has a typical accuracy of 1.5% and a worst-case accuracy of 4%, which

interpolation. The Latin hypercube samples the entire volume of parameter
space, while quadratic polynomial emulation samples only lower-dimensional
subspaces. The Gaussian process provides an estimate of the emulation error and
we show using test simulations that this estimate is reasonable. We construct a
likelihood function and use it to show that the posterior constraints generated
using the emulator are unbiased. We show that our Gaussian process emulator has
lower emulation error than quadratic polynomial interpolation and thus produces
tighter posterior confidence intervals, which will be essential for future
Lyman-$\alpha$ surveys such as DESI.

factors which can be revealed in appropriate environmental conditions. In this
study, extrinsic effects were carefully minimized in a series of experiments on
a seamless cavity. The origin of the Q-slope in low frequency cavities is
traced back to two contributions with different temperature and magnetic field
dependences. The first component of Q-slope, affecting the residual resistance,
is caused by trapped magnetic flux which is normally suppressed by a magnetic
shield for bulk niobium cavities. The second, temperature dependent component
of Q-slope, is similar to the medium-field Q-slope which is well known in bulk

possible future studies are proposed.

kpc projected radius of RAGN in the most dense local environments compared to
those of non-RAGN control samples matched to the RAGN population in colour,
stellar mass, and local environment at 2$\sigma$ significance. Further analyses
show that there are offsets at similar significance between fqs of RAGN-SNGs
and the appropriate control samples for galaxies specifically in cluster
environments and those hosted by most massive cluster galaxies, which
tentatively suggests that some negative feedback from the RAGN is occurring in
these dense environments. In addition, we find that the median radio power of
RAGN increases with increasing local overdensity, an effect which may lend
itself to the quenching of neighboring galaxies. Furthermore, we find that, in
the highest local overdensities, the fq of the sub-sample of lower stellar mass
RAGN-SNGs is larger than that of the higher stellar mass RAGN-SNGs sub-sample,
which indicates a more pronounced effect from RAGN on lower stellar mass
galaxies. We propose a scenario in which RAGN residing within clusters might

which can be used to store energy and that display fast charging. The physics
behind fast charging is still unclear. Is this just due to the collective
behavior of the underlying interacting many-body system or does it have its
roots in the quantum mechanical nature of the system itself? In this work we
address these questions by studying three examples of quantum-mechanical
many-body batteries with rigorous classical analogs. We find that the answer is
model dependent and, even within the same model, depends on the value of the
coupling constant that controls the interaction between the charger and the
battery itself.

on hazard projections. However, projections can differ drastically. What causes
this divergence and which projection(s) should a decision maker adopt to create
plans and adaptation efforts for improving coastal resiliency? Using Norfolk,
Virginia, as a case study, we start to address these questions by
characterizing and quantifying the drivers of differences between published
sea-level rise and storm surge projections, and how these differences can
impact efforts to improve coastal resilience. We find that assumptions about
the complex behavior of ice sheets are the primary drivers of flood hazard
diversity. Adopting a single hazard projection neglects key uncertainties and
can lead to overconfident projections and downwards biased hazard estimates.
These results highlight key avenues to improve the usefulness of hazard
projections to inform decision-making such as (i) representing complex ice
sheet behavior, (ii) covering decision-relevant timescales beyond this century,
(iii) resolving storm surges with a low chance of occurring (e.g., a 0.2%
chance per year), (iv) considering that storm surge projections may deviate
from the historical record, and (v) communicating the considerable deep
uncertainty.

process wherein cells reshape and rearrange to produce tissue-scale
deformations. However, the study of tissue-scale mechanics is impaired by the
difficulty of direct measurement of stress in-vivo. Alternative, image-based
inference schemes aim to estimate stress from snapshots of cellular geometry
but are challenged by sensitivity to fluctuations and measurement noise as well
as the dependence on boundary conditions. Here we overcome these difficulties
by introducing a new variational approach - the Geometrical Variation Method
(GVM) - which exploits the fundamental duality between stress and cellular
geometry that exists in the state of mechanical equilibrium of discrete
mechanical networks that approximate cellular tissues. In the Geometrical
Variation Method, the two dimensional apical geometry of an epithelial tissue
is approximated by a 2D tiling with Circular Arc Polygons (CAP) in which the
arcs represent intercellular interfaces defined by the balance of local line
tension and pressure differentials between adjacent cells. We take advantage of
local constraints that mechanical equilibrium imposes on CAP geometry to define
a variational procedure that extracts the best fitting equilibrium
configuration from images of epithelial monolayers. The GVM-based stress
inference algorithm has been validated by the comparison of the predicted
cellular and mesoscopic scale stress and measured myosin II patterns in the
epithelial tissue during Drosophila embryogenesis. GVM prediction of mesoscopic
stress tensor correlates at the 80% level with the measured myosin distribution
and reveals that most of the myosin II activity is involved in a static
internal force balance within the epithelial layer. Lastly, this study provides
a practical method for non-destructive estimation of stress in live epithelial
tissues.

astrophysical fluids are electrically conducting, it is possible that magnetic
fields play a role in either enhancing or suppressing double-diffusive
convection, but to date there have been no numerical investigations of such
possibilities. Here we study the effects of a vertical background magnetic
field (aligned with the gravitational axis) on the linear stability and
nonlinear saturation of fingering (thermohaline) convection, through a
combination of theoretical work and direct numerical simulations (DNSs). We
find that a vertical magnetic field rigidifies the fingers along the vertical

propose a simple analytical model for mixing by magnetized fingering

automorphisms and translations (the existence of Anosov structures for plane
translations was originally shown by W. White). P. Mendes conjectured that
these are the only topological conjugacy classes for Anosov diffeomorphisms in
the plane. We prove that this claim holds when the Anosov diffeomorphism is the
time-one map of a flow, via a theorem about foliations invariant under a time
one map.

paper, we explore the theoretical aspects of exponential Runge-Kutta (RK) and
linear multistep (LM) methods, in particular, the stability and convergence of
these methods via the transfer matrix formulation. The analysis carried out in
the paper shows that while the exponential LM methods are naturally amenable to
FFT-based fast polynomial arithmetic, the RK methods require equispaced nodes
to achieve that. Therefore, each these family of methods is capable of yielding
a family of fast NFT algorithms such that the scattering coefficients can be
computed with a complexity of $\mathscr{O}(N\log^2N)$ and a rate of convergence
given by $\mathscr{O}(N^{-p})$ where $N$ is the number of samples of the signal
and $p$ is order of the underlying discretization scheme. Further, while RK
methods can accommodate vanishing as well as periodic boundary conditions, the
LM methods can only handle the former type of boundary conditions without
requiring a starting procedure. The ideas presented in this paper extend
naturally to the family of integrators known as general linear methods which
will be explored in a forthcoming paper.

`alignment limit' of parameters readily furnishes one SM-like scalar, and can
be achieved naturally through an underlying symmetry. Among the other physical
states of the 2HDM, a charged scalar $H^\pm$ would provide striking evidence of
new physics if observed. We propose a novel technique for the observation of
the process $pp\to t b H^\pm \to t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ in the dileptonic decay
channel at the LHC. The reconstruction of events in this channel is complicated
by multiple $b$-jets and unobserved neutrinos in the final state. To determine
the neutrino momenta, we implement a neutrino weighting procedure to study, for
the first time, the $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ signature. We further train a pair of
boosted decision trees to reconstruct and classify signal events. We determine
the resulting reach within the context of naturally aligned 2HDMs, such as the
Maximally Symmetric Two Higgs Doublet Model (MS-2HDM). By testing at the
integrated luminosity of 150 fb$^{-1}$ achieved in Run 2 of the LHC, we find

consequences, and analyze their gauging. For simplicity, we focus on
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetries. A 3d topological quantum field theory
(TQFT) $\mathcal{T}$ with such a symmetry has $N$ special lines that generate
it. The braiding of these lines and their spins are characterized by a single
integer $p$ modulo $2N$. Surprisingly, if $\gcd(N,p)=1$ the TQFT factorizes
$\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}'\otimes \mathcal{A}^{N,p}$. Here $\mathcal{T}'$ is a
decoupled TQFT, whose lines are neutral under the global symmetry and
$\mathcal{A}^{N,p}$ is a minimal TQFT with the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry
of label $p$. The parameter $p$ labels the obstruction to gauging the
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry; i.e.\ it characterizes the 't Hooft anomaly
of the global symmetry. When $p=0$ mod $2N$, the symmetry can be gauged.
Otherwise, it cannot be gauged unless we couple the system to a 4d bulk with
gauge fields extended to the bulk. This understanding allows us to consider
$SU(N)$ and $PSU(N)$ 4d gauge theories. Their dynamics is gapped and it is
associated with confinement and oblique confinement -- probe quarks are
confined. In the $PSU(N)$ theory the low-energy theory can include a discrete
gauge theory. We will study the behavior of the theory with a space-dependent
$\theta$-parameter, which leads to interfaces. Typically, the theory on the

introducing new parallel algorithms for collision detection and handling. We
use a well-established boundary integral formulation with spectral Galerkin
method to solve the fluid flow. The key idea is to ensure an interference-free
particle configuration by introducing explicit contact constraints into the
system. While such constraints are typically unnecessary in the formulation
they make it possible to eliminate catastrophic loss of accuracy in the
discretized problem by preventing contact explicitly. The incorporation of
contact constraints results in a significant increase in stable time-step size
for locally-implicit time-stepping and a reduction in the necessary number of
discretization points for stability. Our method maintains the accuracy of
previous methods at a significantly lower cost for dense suspensions and the
time step size is independent from the volume fraction. Our method permits
simulations with high volume fractions; we report results with up to 60% volume
fraction. We demonstrated the parallel scaling of the algorithms on up to 16K

to advance security, imaging, sensing, and communications technology. For
operation in transmission, Huygens' metasurfaces are commonly used, since their
good impedance match to the surrounding media minimizes reflections and
maximizes transmission. Recent theoretical work has shown that Huygens'
metasurfaces are non-optimal, particularly for large angles of refraction, and
that to eliminate reflections and spurious diffracted beams it is necessary to
use a bianisotropic metasurface. However, it remains to be demonstrated how
significant the efficiency improvement is when using bianisotropic
metasurfaces, considering all the non-ideal features that arise when
implementing the metasurface design with real meta-atoms. Here we compare
concrete terahertz metasurface designs based on the Huygens' and Omega-type
bianisotropic approaches, demonstrating anomalous refraction angles for 55
degrees, and 70 degrees. We show that for the lower angle of 55 degrees, there
is no significant improvement when using the bianisotropic design, whereas for
refraction at 70 degrees the bianisotropic design shows much higher efficiency
and fidelity of refraction into the designed direction. We also demonstrate the
strong perturbations caused by near-field interaction, both between and within
cells, which we compensate using numerical optimization.

electromagnetic signals not only from the universe but also from man-made radio
frequency interference of various origins. These range from wanted signals to
unwanted out-of-band emission of radio services and applications to
electromagnetic interference produced by all kinds of electronic and electric
devices. Energy harvesting wind turbines are not only equipped with electric
power conversion hardware but also copious amounts of electronics to control
and monitor the turbines. A wind turbine in the vicinity of a radio telescope
could therefore lead to harmful interference, corrupting the measured
astronomical data. Many observatories seek to coordinate placement of new wind
farms with wind turbine manufacturers and operators, as well as with the local
planning authorities, to avoid such a situation. In our study, we provide
examples as well as guidelines for the determination of the separation
distances between wind turbines and radio observatories, to enable a benign
co-existence for both.
  The proposed calculations entail three basic steps. At first, the anticipated
maximum emitted power level based on the European EN 550011 (CISPR-11)
standard, which applies to industrial devices, is determined. Then secondly,
the propagation loss along the path to the radio receiver is computed via a
model provided by the international telecommunication union. Finally, the
received power is compared to the permitted power limit that pertains in the
protected radio astronomical observing band under consideration. This procedure
may be carried out for each location around a telescope site, in order to
obtain a map of potentially problematic wind turbine positions.

$\rho = 0.09 \pm 0.01$ and $\rho = 0.10 \pm 0.01$, depending on different
physics assumptions and mathematical modelling. The unprecedented precision of
the $\rho$ measurement, combined with the TOTEM total cross-section

implied the exclusion of all the models classified and published by COMPETE.
The $\rho$ results obtained by TOTEM are compatible with the predictions, from
alternative theoretical models both in the Regge-like framework and in the QCD
framework, of a colourless 3-gluon bound state exchange in the $t$-channel of
the proton-proton elastic scattering. On the contrary, if shown that the
3-gluon bound state $t$-channel exchange is not of importance for the
description of elastic scattering, the $\rho$ value determined by TOTEM would
represent a first evidence of a slowing down of the total cross-section growth
at higher energies. The very low-$|t|$ reach allowed also to determine the
absolute normalisation using the Coulomb amplitude for the first time at the
LHC and obtain a new total proton-proton cross-section measurement

TOTEM determination. Combining the two TOTEM results yields $\sigma_{tot} =

This simple deviation from the standard setup is sufficient to prove that

the shift in the critical properties induced by heterogeneous recovery rates.
Additionally, we show that the critical value of infectivity tends to be
smaller than the one predicted by quenched mean-field approaches in the
homogeneous case and that it can be linked to the variance of the recovery
rates. We then illustrate the role of dynamical--structural correlations, which
allow for a complete change in the critical behavior. We show that it is
possible for a power-law network topology to behave similarly to a homogeneous
structure by an appropriate tuning of its recovery rates, and vice versa.
Finally, we show how heterogeneity in recovery rates affects the network

the normative systems of the stakeholders such that the combined expertise of
the stakeholders may resolve the dilemma. Thirdly, and only if these two other
methods have failed, the Jiminy uses context-sensitive rules to decide which of
the stakeholders take preference over the others. At the abstract level, these
three methods are characterized by adding arguments, adding attacks between
arguments, and revising attacks between arguments. We show how a Jiminy can be
used not only for ethical reasoning and collaborative decision-making, but also
to provide explanations about ethical behavior.

  recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Machine hearing or listening represents an emerging area. Conventional
approaches rely on the design of handcrafted features specialized to a specific
audio task and that can hardly generalized to other audio fields. For example,
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and its variants were successfully
applied to computational auditory scene recognition while Chroma vectors are
good at music chord recognition. Unfortunately, these predefined features may
be of variable discrimination power while extended to other tasks or even
within the same task due to different nature of clips. Motivated by this need
of a principled framework across domain applications for machine listening, we
propose a generic and data-driven representation learning approach. For this
sake, a novel and efficient supervised dictionary learning method is presented.
The method learns dissimilar dictionaries, one per each class, in order to
extract heterogeneous information for classification. In other words, we are
seeking to minimize the intra-class homogeneity and maximize class
separability. This is made possible by promoting pairwise orthogonality between
class specific dictionaries and controlling the sparsity structure of the audio
clip's decomposition over these dictionaries. The resulting optimization
problem is non-convex and solved using a proximal gradient descent method.
Experiments are performed on both computational auditory scene (East Anglia and
Rouen) and synthetic music chord recognition datasets. Obtained results show
that our method is capable to reach state-of-the-art hand-crafted features for
both applications.

the potential to mitigate increasing fluctuations in renewable electricity
generation, but only if their joint response is coordinated. However, the

heterogeneity of the resources, conflict of interests, and impact on the grid.
Correspondingly, overcoming these challenges with a general and fair yet
efficient exchange mechanism that coordinates these distributed resources will
accommodate renewable fluctuations on a local level, thereby supporting the
energy transition. In this paper, we introduce such an exchange mechanism. It
incorporates a payment structure that encourages prosumers to participate in
the exchange by increasing their utility above baseline alternatives. The
allocation from the proposed mechanism increases the system efficiency
(utilitarian social welfare) and distributes profits more fairly (measured by
Nash social welfare) than individual flexibility activation. A case study
analyzing the mechanism performance and resulting payments in numerical
experiments over real demand and generation profiles of the Pecan Street

encounter KBO (486958) 2014 MU69 acquired near opposition in July 2017. In
order to plan the optimum flyby sequence the NH mission planners needed to
learn as much as possible about the target in advance of the encounter.
Specifically, from lightcurve data, encounter timing could be adjusted to
accommodate a highly elongated, binary, or rapidly rotating target. HST
astrometric (Porter et al. 2018) and stellar occultation (Buie et al. 2018)
observations constrained MU69's orbit and diameter (21-41 km for an albedo of
0.15-0.04), respectively. Photometry from the astrometric dataset suggested a
variability of $\ge$0.3 mags, but they did not determine the period or provide
shape information. We strategically spaced 24 HST orbits over 9 days to
investigate rotation periods from approximately 2-100 hours and to better
constrain the lightcurve amplitude. Until NH detected MU69 in its optical
navigation images beginning in August 2018, this HST campaign provided the most
accurate photometry to date. The mean variation in our data is 0.15 mags which
suggests that MU69 is either nearly spherical (a:b axis ratio of 1:1.15), or
its pole vector is pointed near the line of sight to Earth; this interpretation
does not preclude a near-contact binary or bi-lobed object. However, image
stacks do conclude that MU69 does not have a binary companion $\ge$2000 km with
a sensitivity to 29th magnitude. We report with confidence that MU69 is not
both rapidly rotating and highly elongated. We note that our results are
consistent with the fly-by imagery and orientation of MU69 (Stern et al. 2019).
The combined dataset also suggests that within the KBO lightcurve literature
there are likely other objects which share a geometric configuration like MU69
resulting in an underestimate of the contact binary fraction for the CC Kuiper
Belt.

regularization properties of CGME and LSMR, including the filtered SVD
expansion of CGME iterates, and prove that the 2-norm filtering best
regularized solutions by CGME and LSMR are less accurate than and at least as
accurate as those by LSQR, respectively. We also prove that the
semi-convergence of CGME and LSMR always occurs no later and sooner than that
of LSQR, respectively. As a byproduct, using the analysis approach for CGME, we
improve a fundamental result on the accuracy of the truncated rank $k$
approximate SVD of $A$ generated by randomized algorithms, and reveal how the
truncation step damages the accuracy. Numerical experiments justify our results
on CGME and LSMR.

  Application to a Powered Prosthetic Ankle",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Design of robotic systems that safely and efficiently operate in uncertain
operational conditions, such as rehabilitation and physical assistance robots,
remains an important challenge in the field. Current methods for the design of
energy efficient series elastic actuators use an optimization formulation that
typically assumes known operational conditions. This approach could lead to
actuators that cannot perform in uncertain environments because elongation,
speed, or torque requirements may be beyond actuator specifications when the
operation deviates from its nominal conditions. Addressing this gap, we propose
a convex optimization formulation to design the stiffness of series elastic
actuators to minimize energy consumption and satisfy actuator constraints
despite uncertainty due to manufacturing of the spring, unmodeled dynamics,
efficiency of the transmission, and the kinematics and kinetics of the load. In
our formulation, we express energy consumption as a scalar convex-quadratic
function of compliance. In the unconstrained case, this quadratic equation
provides an analytical solution to the optimal value of stiffness that
minimizes energy consumption for arbitrary periodic reference trajectories. As
actuator constraints, we consider peak motor torque, peak motor velocity,
limitations due to the speed-torque relationship of DC motors, and peak
elongation of the spring. As a simulation case study, we apply our formulation
to the robust design of a series elastic actuator for a powered prosthetic
ankle. Our simulation results indicate that a small trade-off between energy
efficiency and robustness is justified to design actuators that can operate
with uncertainty.

observed longitudinal data that take values on a nonlinear manifold, a major
challenge is how to handle the sparse and irregular observations that are
commonly encountered in longitudinal studies. Addressing this challenge, we
provide theory and implementations for a manifold version of the principal
analysis by conditional expectation (PACE) procedure that produces
representations intrinsic to the manifold, extending a well-established version
of functional principal component analysis targeting sparsely sampled
longitudinal data in linear spaces. Key steps are local linear smoothing
methods for the estimation of a Fr\'echet mean curve, mapping the observed
manifold-valued longitudinal data to tangent spaces around the estimated mean
curve, and applying smoothing methods to obtain the covariance structure of the
mapped data. Dimension reduction is achieved via representations based on the
first few leading principal components. A finitely truncated representation of
the original manifold-valued data is then obtained by mapping these tangent
space representations to the manifold. We show that the proposed estimates of
mean curve and covariance structure achieve state-of-the-art convergence rates.
For longitudinal emotional well-being data for unemployed workers as an example
of time-dynamic compositional data that are located on a sphere, we demonstrate
that our methods lead to interpretable eigenfunctions and principal component
scores. In a second example, we analyze the body shapes of wallabies by mapping
the relative size of their body parts onto a spherical pre-shape space.
Compared to standard functional principal component analysis, which is based on
Euclidean geometry, the proposed approach leads to improved trajectory recovery
for sparsely sampled data on nonlinear manifolds.

representation of nuclear, coal and oil generation facilities is set to
dramatically fall, and natural gas, wind and solar facilities will come to fill
their place. The introduction of variable energy resources (VERs) like solar
and wind, however, necessitates fundamental changes in the power grid's dynamic
operation. VER forecasts are uncertain and their profiles are intermittent thus
requiring greater quantities of operating reserves. This paper describes the
methodology and the key findings of the 2017 ISO New England System Operational
Analysis and Renewable Energy Integration Study (SOARES). This study was
commissioned by the ISO New England stakeholders to investigate the effect of
several scenarios of varying generation mix on normal operating reserves. The
project was conducted using the holistic assessment approach called the
Electric Power Enterprise Control System (EPECS) simulator.The EPECS
characterizes a power system in terms of the physical power grid and its
multiple layers of control including commitment decisions, economic dispatch,
and regulation services. This paper provides precise definitions of how
variable energy resources and operating reserves are modeled. It also includes
detailed models of the day-ahead resource scheduling, the same-day resource
scheduling, the real-time balancing operations and the regulation service.
Among the key findings, the reports shows that scenarios with high penetrations
of VERs exhaust their operating reserves for part of the year and all scenarios
curtail semi-dispatchable resources both to complement operating reserves and
to mitigate some of the topological limitations of the system. Overall,
curtailment emerges as a key balancing performance control lever and there is a
clear need for higher amounts of operating reserves.

formulation of HDG, applied to the implicit solution of unsteady compressible
flows. The matrix-free implementation allows for a reduction of the memory
footprint of the solver when dealing with implicit time-accurate
discretizations. HDG reduces the number of globally-coupled degrees of freedom
relative to DG, at high order, by statically condensing element-interior
degrees of freedom from the system in favor of face unknowns. The primal
formulation further reduces the element-interior degrees of freedom by
eliminating the gradient as a separate unknown. This paper introduces a
$p$-multigrid preconditioner implementation for these discretizations and
presents results for various flow problems. Benefits of the $p$-multigrid
strategy relative to simpler, less expensive, preconditioners are observed for
stiff systems, such as those arising from low-Mach number flows at high-order

scalability for parallel computations. Additional savings in both speed and

label-rich to label-poor domains which can significantly reduce annotation
costs associated with detection. Recently, approaches that align distributions
of source and target images using an adversarial loss have been proven
effective for adapting object classifiers. However, for object detection, fully
matching the entire distributions of source and target images to each other at
the global image level may fail, as domains could have distinct scene layouts
and different combinations of objects. On the other hand, strong matching of
local features such as texture and color makes sense, as it does not change
category level semantics. This motivates us to propose a novel method for
detector adaptation based on strong local alignment and weak global alignment.
Our key contribution is the weak alignment model, which focuses the adversarial
alignment loss on images that are globally similar and puts less emphasis on
aligning images that are globally dissimilar. Additionally, we design the
strong domain alignment model to only look at local receptive fields of the
feature map. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method on four
datasets comprising both large and small domain shifts. Our code is available

the nonequilibrium scenario, which grows monotonically with the nonequilibrium
condition quantified by the temperature difference or chemical potential
difference of the two baths. The steady-state entanglement in general is a
non-monotonic function of the nonequilibrium condition as well as the bath
parameters in the equilibrium setting. We also find that weak inter-qubit
coupling and high base temperature or chemical potential of the baths can
strongly suppress the steady-state entanglement and coherence, regardless of
the strength of the nonequilibrium condition. On the other hand, the energy
detuning of the two qubits, when used in a compensatory way with the
nonequilibrium condition, can lead to significant enhancement of the
steady-state entanglement in some parameter regimes. In addition, the qubits
typically have a stronger steady-state entanglement when coupled to fermion

such as searches for new particles at colliders, and indirect DM searches in
cosmic-ray spectra. Low energy (< 0.25 GeV/n) cosmic-ray antiparticles such as
antideuterons are strong candidates for probing DM models, as the yield of
these particles from DM processes can exceed the astrophysical background by
more than two orders of magnitude. The General Antiparticle Spectrometer
(GAPS), a balloon borne cosmic-ray detector, will perform an ultra-low
background measurement of the cosmic antideuteron flux in the regime < 0.25
GeV/n, which will constrain a wide range of DM models. GAPS will also detect
approximately 1000 antiprotons in an unexplored energy range throughout one
long duration balloon (LDB) flight, which will constrain < 10 GeV DM models and
validate the GAPS detection technique. Unlike magnetic spectrometers, GAPS
relies on the formation of an exotic atom within the tracker in order to
identify antiparticles. The GAPS tracker consists of ten layers of
lithium-drifted silicon detectors which record dE/dx deposits from primary and
nuclear annihilation product tracks, as well as measure the energy of the
exotic atom deexcitation X-rays. A two-layer, plastic scintillator time of
flight (TOF) system surrounds the tracker and measures the particle velocity,
dE/dx deposits, and provides a fast trigger to the tracker. The nuclear
annihilation product multiplicity, deexcitation X-ray energies, TOF, and
stopping depth are all used together to discern between antiparticle species.
This presentation provided an overview of the GAPS experiment, an update on the
construction of the tracker and TOF systems, and a summary of the expected
performance of GAPS in light of the upcoming LDB flight from McMurdo Station,

model at half-filling is revisited in relation to the DOS and spectral
functions by means of the ladder dual fermion approximation (LDFA). For this
purpose, a new expression of the two-body Green's function in the form of
resolvents is proposed, which provides tractable and efficient means to
calculate the local vertex function with the Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED)
method. This makes it possible to use the Lanczos ED method as a solver of the
effective impurity Anderson model for LDFA, opening up the way to access low
temperatures for these perturbative extensions of the dynamical mean field
theory and to obtain accurate DOS and spectral functions on the real frequency
axis by a new variant of the maximum entropy method. It is found that for $U\le
3.5t$, as temperature decreases, the pseudogap formation due to
antiferromagnetic correlations in the quasiparticle peak of the spectral
function occurs at the X point $[k=(\pi,0)]$, spreads through the Fermi surface
and ends at the M$_2$ point $[k=(\pi/2,\pi/2)]$. The almost simultaneous
creation of the pseudogap and the loss of the Fermi liquid feature is
consistent with that expected in the Slater regime. Although the pseudogap
still appears in the quasi-particle-like single peak for $U\ge 4.0t$, the
Fermi-liquid feature is partially lost on the Fermi surface already at higher
temperatures as expected in the Mott-Heisenberg regime, in which local spins
are preformed at high temperatures. A sharp crossover from a pseudogap phase to
a Mott insulator at finite $U^{*} \approx 4.7t$ is found to occur below the
temperature of the pseudogap formation similar to a previous study with the
non-linear $\sigma$ model approach.

Consequently, the Stokes equation can be solved as an elliptic system instead
of a saddle-point problem due to such weak form. The number of degree of

Recently, Dalessandro et al. (2018) (D18) compared the observed
color--magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of both the cluster and a nearby reference
field (although observed with the ACS/WFC instrument). They conclude that the
bifurcated pattern of BSSs in NGC 2173 observed by L18 is a field contamination
artefact. In this note, we explore the central concentration properties of the
removed `field stars' identified by D18. Our purpose is to examine if these
`field stars' are spatially homogeneously distributed. Employing a Monte
Carlo-based approach, we have carefully studied the probability that any such
central concentration may be caused by small number statistics. We find that,
in most cases of, the `field stars' removed by D18 exhibit a clear central
concentration, which cannot be explained on the basis of small number
statistics alone. Therefore, we suggest that D18 may well have overestimated
the field contamination level, implying that the bifurcated BSS pattern in NGC
2173 cannot, in fact, be explained by field contamination.

applications and services for mobile device users. A key component of many of
these services is the ability to infer the current location and predict the
future location of users based on location sensors embedded in the devices.
Such knowledge enables service providers to present relevant and timely offers
to their users and better manage traffic congestion control, thus increasing
customer satisfaction and engagement. However, such services suffer from
location data leakage which has become one of today's most concerning privacy
issues for smartphone users. In this paper we focus specifically on location
data that is exposed by Android applications via Internet network traffic in
plaintext (i.e., without encryption) without the user's awareness. We present
an empirical evaluation, involving the network traffic of real mobile device
users, aimed at: (1) measuring the extent of location data leakage in the
Internet traffic of Android-based smartphone devices; and (2) understanding the
value of this data by inferring users' points of interests (POIs). This was
achieved by analyzing the Internet traffic recorded from the smartphones of a
group of 71 participants for an average period of 37 days. We also propose a
procedure for mining and filtering location data from raw network traffic and
utilize geolocation clustering methods to infer users' POIs. The key findings
of this research center on the extent of this phenomenon in terms of both
ubiquity and severity; we found that over 85\% of devices of users are leaking
location data, and the exposure rate of users' POIs, derived from the
relatively sparse leakage indicators, is around 61%.

to train an off-the-shelf segmentation network in an iterative way. However,
the initial generated masks usually contains a notable proportion of invalid
masks which are mainly caused by small object instances. Directly using these
initial masks to train segmentation model is harmful for the performance. To
address this problem, we propose a hybrid network in this paper. In our
architecture, there is a principle segmentation network which is used to handle
the normal samples with valid generated masks. In addition, a complementary
branch is added to handle the small and dim objects without valid masks.
Experimental results indicate that our method can achieve significantly
performance improvement both on the small object instances and large ones, and

segregated stellar metallicity populations, a centrally concentrated metal-rich
population and a more extended metal-poor population. In this work we discuss
mechanisms that lead to the formation of two spatially segregated metallicity
populations. Using a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of Local
Group-like environments, we select a sample of satellite and field galaxies,
spanning the stellar mass range $10^6-10^9$M$_{\odot}$, that exhibit bimodality
in their metallicity distributions. Among those, we identify a subsample with a
strong spatial segregation in the two populations. We find three distinct
mechanisms for their formation. In field dwarfs and in a small fraction of
satellites, a merger causes the metal-poor stars to migrate to larger radii and
encourages the available gas to sink to the centre of the dwarf. Most of the
gas is subsequently blown out of the halo through star formation feedback, but
the remaining gas is consumed in the formation of a metal-rich population. In
the exclusive case of satellites that have retained some of their gas at
infall, it is the compression of this gas by ram pressure near pericentre that
triggers the formation of metal-rich stars, whilst simultaneously preventing
star formation at larger radii through stripping. Additionally, in a small
number of field and satellite dwarfs, interactions with gaseous filaments and
other galaxies can result in the formation of a metal-rich population.
Regardless of the formation mechanism, a history of mergers typically enhances
the spatial segregation.

cubed sphere is presented. The model uses a mixed mimetic spectral element
discretization which allows for the exact exchanges of kinetic, internal and
potential energy via the compatibility properties of the chosen function
spaces. A Strang carryover dimensional splitting procedure is used, with the
horizontal dynamics solved explicitly and the vertical dynamics solved
implicitly so as to avoid the CFL restriction of the vertical sound waves. The
function spaces used to represent the horizontal dynamics are discontinuous
across vertical element boundaries, such that each horizontal layer is solved
independently so as to avoid the need to invert a global 3D mass matrix, while
the function spaces used to represent the vertical dynamics are similarly
discontinuous across horizontal element boundaries, allowing for the serial
solution of the vertical dynamics independently for each horizontal element.
The model is validated against standard test cases for baroclinic instability
within an otherwise hydrostatically and geostrophically balanced atmosphere,
and a non-hydrostatic gravity wave as driven by a temperature perturbation.

the level of user participation. This paper designs an incentive mechanism to
motivate a heterogeneous crowd of users to actively participate in
crowdsourcing campaigns. We cast the problem in a new, asymmetric all-pay
contest model with incomplete information, where an arbitrary n of users exert
irrevocable effort to compete for a prize tuple. The prize tuple is an array of
prize functions as opposed to a single constant prize typically used by
conventional contests. We design an optimal contest that (a) induces the
maximum profit---total user effort minus the prize payout---for the
crowdsourcer, and (b) ensures users to strictly have the incentive to
participate. In stark contrast to intuition and prior related work, our
mechanism induces an equilibrium in which heterogeneous users behave
independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. This
newly discovered property, which we coin as strategy autonomy (SA), is of
practical significance: it (a) reduces computational and storage complexity by
n-fold for each user, (b) increases the crowdsourcer's revenue by counteracting
an effort reservation effect existing in asymmetric contests, and (c)
neutralizes the (almost universal) law of diminishing marginal returns (DMR).
Through an extensive numerical case study, we demonstrate and scrutinize the
superior profitability of our mechanism, as well as draw insights into the SA
property.

To address this issue, we investigate a machine learning-based approach to fuzz
testing in which we outline a family of test-case generators based on Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) and train those on readily available datasets with a
minimum of human fine tuning. The proposed generators do, in contrast to
previous work, not rely on heuristic sampling strategies but principled
sampling from the predictive distributions. We provide a detailed analysis to
demonstrate the characteristics and efficacy of the proposed generators in a
challenging web browser testing scenario. The empirical results show that the
RNN-based generators are able to provide better coverage than a mutation based
method and are able to discover paths not discovered by a classical fuzzer. Our
results supplement findings in other domains suggesting that generation based
fuzzing with RNNs is a viable route to better software quality conditioned on
the use of a suitable model selection/analysis procedure.

5\,TeV, and its spectrum is well-represented by a power-law function with
spectral index of $2.74 \pm 0.08$. The complexity of the region makes the
identification of the origin of the very-high energy emission difficult,
however the spectral agreement with the LAT source and overlapping position at
less than 1.5$\sigma$ point to a common origin. We analysed 8 years of
\fermi-LAT data to extend the spectrum of the source down to 60\,MeV.
\fermi-LAT and MAGIC spectra overlap within errors and the global broad band
spectrum is described by a power-law with exponential cutoff at
$1.9\pm0.5$\,TeV. The detected $\gamma$-ray emission can be interpreted as the
results of proton-proton interaction between the supernova and the CO-rich

limits of transport. The thermal and electrical conductance of gold atomic
contacts has been recently proven to be quantized at room temperature. However,
a big experimental challenge in such measurements is represented by the fast
breaking dynamics of metallic junctions at room temperature, which can exceed
the typical response time of the thermal measurement. Here we use a
break-junction setup that combines Scanning Tunneling Microscopy with suspended
micro electro-mechanical systems with a gold-covered membrane and an integrated
heater acting also as thermometer. By using other metals as tip materials,
namely Pt, PtIr and W, we show heat transport measurements through single gold
atomic contacts. The dependence of the thermal conductance is analysed as
function of contact size and material used. We find that by using Pt and Pt-Ir
tips we can maximize the mechanical stability and probability of forming single
Au atomic contacts. We then show the quantization of the electrical and thermal
conductance with the verification of the Wiedemann-Franz law at the atomic
scale. We expect these findings to increase the flexibility of experimental
techniques probing heat transport in metallic quantum point contacts and to
enable the investigation of thermal properties of molecular junctions.

from another point of view, to change the color/texture of an object, or to
insert a virtual object consistently lit into a real video or photograph.
Specifically, the estimation of a point light source is required for the
shadows cast by the inserted object to be consistent with the real scene. We
tackle the problem of illumination retrieval given an RGBD image of the scene
as an inverse problem: we aim to find the illumination that minimizes the

ejecta, there is at times a much faster transfer of energy from the region of
the accretion flow along the jet. The nature of this ultrarelativistic flow
remains unclear and while there is some evidence for a similar phenomenon in
other systems which might contain neutron stars, it has never been observed in
a confirmed black hole system. We have compared these previous radio
observations with a new analysis of simultaneous X-ray observations which were
performed with the RXTE mission. We find that the ejection of the
ultra-relativistic flow seems to be associated with the simultaneous appearance
of two particular types of quasi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray power
spectrum. In contrast, the mildly relativistic, radio-emitting outflows may be
associated with flat-topped broad band noise in the X-ray power spectrum. This
is the first time a link, albeit tentative, has been found between these
mysterious unseen flows and the accretion flow from which they are launched.

around its center, the long-range entanglement becomes short-range which can
lead to topological phases protected by symmetries (SPT). The phases are
trivial for bond-centered foldings, and non trivial for site-centered ones. In
the latter case, the folded spin 1/2 chain with $U(1)$ symmetry belongs to the

(IoT) by bridging the gap between the physical and the cyber worlds. Anomaly
detection is a critical task in this context as it is responsible for
identifying various events of interests such as equipment faults and
undiscovered phenomena. However, this task is challenging because of the
elusive nature of anomalies and the volatility of the ambient environments. In
a resource-scarce setting like WSN, this challenge is further elevated and
weakens the suitability of many existing solutions. In this paper, for the
first time, we introduce autoencoder neural networks into WSN to solve the
anomaly detection problem. We design a two-part algorithm that resides on
sensors and the IoT cloud respectively, such that (i) anomalies can be detected
at sensors in a fully distributed manner without the need for communicating
with any other sensors or the cloud, and (ii) the relatively more
computation-intensive learning task can be handled by the cloud with a much
lower (and configurable) frequency. In addition to the minimal communication
overhead, the computational load on sensors is also very low (of polynomial
complexity) and readily affordable by most COTS sensors. Using a real WSN
indoor testbed and sensor data collected over 4 consecutive months, we
demonstrate via experiments that our proposed autoencoder-based anomaly
detection mechanism achieves high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate.
It is also able to adapt to unforeseeable and new changes in a non-stationary
environment, thanks to the unsupervised learning feature of our chosen
autoencoder neural networks.

the following two directions. Firstly, I demonstrate that quantum algorithms
can be applied to enhance the computing and training of Gaussian processes
(GPs), a powerful model widely used in classical statistical inference and
supervised machine learning. A crucial component of the quantum GP algorithm is
solving linear systems with quantum computers, for which I present a novel
algorithm that achieves a provable advantage over previously known methods. I
will also explicitly address the task of encoding the classical data into a
quantum state for machine learning applications. I then apply the quantum
enhanced GPs to Bayesian deep learning and present an experimental
demonstration on contemporary hardware and simulators. Secondly, I look into
the notion of quantum causality and apply it to inferring spatial and temporal
quantum correlations, and present an analytical toolkit for causal inference in
quantum data. I will also make the connection between causality and quantum
communications, and present a general bound for the quantum capacity of noisy
communication channels.

provides a potentially increased sensitivity in comparison to inclusive
channels, where the background is often overwhelming. We pay particular
attention to the challenges that such searches would face in the hostile high
pile--up environment of the LHC, giving close consideration to the backgrounds
that will be present. The signal we focus on is the exclusive production of
same-flavour muon and electron pairs, with missing energy in the final state,
and with two outgoing intact protons registered by the dedicated forward proton
detectors installed in association with ATLAS and CMS. We present results for
slepton masses of 120--300 GeV and slepton--neutralino mass splitting of 10--20
GeV, and find that the relevant backgrounds can be controlled to the level of
the expected signal yields. The most significant such backgrounds are due to
semi--exclusive lepton pair production at lower masses, with a proton produced
in the initial proton dissociation system registering in the forward detectors,
and from the coincidence of forward protons produced in pile-up events with an
inclusive central event that mimics the signal. We also outline a range of
potential methods to further suppress these backgrounds as well as to enlarge
the signal yields.

both of the pre and postselected states are separable states. To prove this
kind of quantum correlations, a measurement apparatus must be arranged in
entanglement to perform a joint measurement on the quantum system. In this
paper we discuss how to design the state of entangled meters to achieve such a
measurement. We also propose an experimental setup composed of linear optics

Stokes equations in arbitrary dimension which is quasi-optimal, in the sense
that the error of the discrete velocity field in a broken $H^1$-norm is
proportional to the error of the best approximation to the analytical velocity
field. In particular, the velocity error is independent of the pressure error
and the discrete velocity field is element-wise solenoidal. Moreover, the sum
of the velocity error times the viscosity plus the pressure $L^2$-error is
proportional to the sum of the respective best errors. All proportionality
constants are bounded in terms of shape regularity and do not depend on the
viscosity. For simply connected two-dimensional domains, the velocity and

is an improved variant of the Faure-Loidreau (FL) system, which was broken in a
structural attack by Gaborit, Otmani, and Tal\'e Kalachi (GOT, 2018). We keep
the FL encryption and decryption algorithms, but modify the insecure key
generation algorithm. Our crucial observation is that the GOT attack is
equivalent to decoding an interleaved Gabidulin code. The new key generation
algorithm constructs public keys for which all polynomial-time interleaved
decoders fail---hence LIGA resists the GOT attack. We also prove that the
public-key encryption version of LIGA is IND-CPA secure in the standard model
and the KEM version is IND-CCA2 secure in the random oracle model, both under
hardness assumptions of formally defined problems related to list decoding and
interleaved decoding of Gabidulin codes. We propose and analyze various
exponential-time attacks on these problems, calculate their work factors, and
compare the resulting parameters to NIST proposals. The strengths of LIGA are
short ciphertext sizes and (relatively) small key sizes. Further, LIGA
guarantees correct decryption and has no decryption failure rate. It is not
based on hiding the structure of a code. Since there are efficient and
constant-time algorithms for encoding and decoding Gabidulin codes, timing
attacks on the encryption and decryption algorithms can be easily prevented.

Android app developers. To leverage Android's frequently released APIs,
developers must often spend considerable effort on API migrations. Prior
research and Android official documentation typically provide enough
information to guide developers in identifying the API calls that must be
migrated and the corresponding API calls in an updated version of Android (what
to migrate). However, API migration remains a challenging task since developers
lack the knowledge of how to migrate the API calls. There exist code examples,
such as Google Samples, that illustrate the usage of APIs. We posit that by
analyzing the changes of API usage in code examples, we can learn API migration
patterns to assist developers with API Migrations.
  In this paper, we propose an approach that learns API migration patterns from
code examples, applies these patterns to the source code of Android apps for
API migration, and presents the results to users as potential migration
solutions. To evaluate our approach, we migrate API calls in open source
Android apps by learning API migration patterns from code examples. We find
that our approach can successfully learn API migration patterns and provide API
migration assistance in 71 out of 80 cases. Our approach can either migrate API
calls with little to no extra modifications needed or provide guidance to
assist with the migrations. Through a user study, we find that adopting our
approach can reduce the time spent on migrating APIs, on average, by 29%.
Moreover, our interviews with app developers highlight the benefits of our
approach when seeking API migrations. Our approach demonstrates the value of
leveraging the knowledge contained in software repositories to facilitate API
migrations.

propose using the Wide--Fast--Deep survey that contains several nearby galaxies
(at distances where the stars themselves are not resolved, i.e., beyond 20
Mpc). In the context of hierarchical galaxy formation, it is necessary to
understand the prevalence and properties of tidal substructure around external
galaxies based on integrated (i.e., unresolved) diffuse light. This requires
collecting observations on much larger samples of galaxies than the Milky Way
and M31. We will compare the observed structures to the predictions of
cosmological models of galactic halo formation that inform us about the number
and properties of streams around Milky Way-like galaxies. The insight gained
from these comparisons will allow us to infer the properties of stream
progenitors (masses, dynamics, metallicities, stellar populations). The changes
in the host galaxies caused by the interactions with the dissolving companion
galaxies will be another focus of our studies. We conclude by discussing
synergies with WFIRST and Euclid, and also provide concrete suggestions for how
the effects of scattered light could be minimized in LSST images to optimize
the search for low surface brightness features, such as faint unresolved
stellar tidal streams.

Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
outputs. We have tried to answer two important questions: 1. Does NMT perform
equivalently well with respect to SMT and 2. Does it add extra flavor in
improving the quality of MT output by employing simple sentences as training
units. In order to obtain insights, we have developed three core models viz.,
SMT model based on Moses toolkit, followed by character and word level NMT
models. All of the systems use English-Hindi and English-Bengali language pairs
containing simple sentences as well as sentences of other complexity. In order
to preserve the translations semantics with respect to the target words of a
sentence, we have employed soft-attention into our word level NMT model. We
have further evaluated all the systems with respect to the scenarios where they
succeed and fail. Finally, the quality of translation has been validated using
BLEU and TER metrics along with manual parameters like fluency, adequacy etc.
We observed that NMT outperforms SMT in case of simple sentences whereas SMT
outperforms in case of all types of sentence.

video-based pig monitoring applications. However, it still remains a
challenging task in complex scenes, due to problems of light fluctuation,
similar appearances of pigs, shape deformations and occlusions. To tackle these
problems, we propose a robust real time multiple pig detection and tracking
method which does not require manual marking or physical identification of the
pigs, and works under both daylight and infrared light conditions. Our method
couples a CNN-based detector and a correlation filter-based tracker via a novel
hierarchical data association algorithm. The detector gains the best
accuracy/speed trade-off by using the features derived from multiple layers at
different scales in a one-stage prediction network. We define a tag-box for
each pig as the tracking target, and the multiple object tracking is conducted
in a key-points tracking manner using learned correlation filters. Under
challenging conditions, the tracking failures are modelled based on the
relations between responses of detector and tracker, and the data association
algorithm allows the detection hypotheses to be refined, meanwhile the drifted
tracks can be corrected by probing the tracking failures followed by the
re-initialization of tracking. As a result, the optimal tracklets can
sequentially grow with on-line refined detections, and tracking fragments are
correctly integrated into respective tracks while keeping the original
identifications. Experiments with a dataset captured from a commercial farm
show that our method can robustly detect and track multiple pigs under
challenging conditions. The promising performance of the proposed method also
demonstrates a feasibility of long-term individual pig tracking in a complex
environment and thus promises a commercial potential.

of material uncertainties. The uncertainties are handled in a worst-case sense,
i.e. the worst possible material distribution over a given uncertainty set is
taken into account for each topology. The worst-case approach leads to a
minimax problem, which is analyzed throughout the paper. A conservative convex
relaxation for the inner maximization problem is suggested, which allows to
treat the minimax problem by minimization of an optimal value function. A
Tikhonov type and a barrier regularization scheme are developed, which render
the resulting minimization problem continuously differentiable. The barrier
regularization scheme turns out to be more suitable for the practical solution
of the problem, as it can be closely linked to a highly efficient interior
point approach used for the evaluation of the optimal value function and its
gradient. Based on this, the outer minimization problem can be approached by a
gradient based optimization solver like the method of moving asymptotes.
Examples from additive manufacturing as well as material degradation are
examined, demonstrating the practical applicability as well as the efficiency
of the suggested method. Finally, the impact of the convex relaxation of the
inner problem is investigated. It is observed that for large material
deviations, the robust solution may become too conservative. As a remedy, a
RAMP-type continuation scheme for the inner problem is suggested and

$S^{-1} = ZZ^*$ of Hermitian positive definite matrices $S$ with localized
structure, e.g. exponential decay with respect to some given distance function
on the index set of $S$. The algorithm is a reformulation of recursive inverse
factorization [J. Chem. Phys., 128 (2008), 104105] but makes use of localized
operations only. At each level of recursion, the problem is cut into two
subproblems and their solutions are combined using iterative refinement [Phys.
Rev. B, 70 (2004), 193102] to give a solution to the original problem. The two
subproblems can be solved in parallel without any communication and, using the
localized formulation, the cost of combining their results is proportional to
the cut size, defined by the binary partition of the index set. This means that
for cut sizes increasing as $o(n)$ with system size $n$ the cost of combining
the two subproblems is negligible compared to the overall cost for sufficiently
large systems.
  We also present an alternative derivation of iterative refinement based on a
sign matrix formulation, analyze the stability, and propose a parameterless
stopping criterion. We present bounds for the initial factorization error and
the number of iterations in terms of the condition number of $S$ when the
starting guess is given by the solution of the two subproblems in the binary
recursion. These bounds are used in theoretical results for the decay
properties of the involved matrices.
  The localization properties of our algorithms are demonstrated for matrices
corresponding to nearest neighbor overlap on one-, two-, and three-dimensional
lattices as well as basis set overlap matrices generated using the Hartree-Fock

model is to combine a depth-wise separable convolution with a dilated
convolution. However, the simple combination of these two methods results in an
over-simplified operation which causes severe performance degradation due to
loss of information contained in the feature map. To resolve this problem, we
propose a new block called Concentrated-Comprehensive Convolution (C3) which
applies the asymmetric convolutions before the depth-wise separable dilated
convolution to compensate for the information loss due to dilated convolution.
The C3 block consists of a concentration stage and a comprehensive convolution
stage. The first stage uses two depth-wise asymmetric convolutions for
compressed information from the neighboring pixels to alleviate the information
loss. The second stage increases the receptive field by using a depth-wise
separable dilated convolution from the feature map of the first stage. We
applied the C3 block to various segmentation frameworks (ESPNet, DRN, ERFNet,
ENet) for proving the beneficial properties of our proposed method.
Experimental results show that the proposed method preserves the original
accuracies on Cityscapes dataset while reducing the complexity. Furthermore, we
modified ESPNet to achieve about 2% better performance while reducing the
number of parameters by half and the number of FLOPs by 35% compared with the
original ESPNet. Finally, experiments on ImageNet classification task show that
C3 block can successfully replace dilated convolutions.

gradient echo scans using convolutional neural networks.
  Methods: Whole-body gradient echo scans of 240 subjects, each consisting of 5
bipolar echoes, were used. Reference fat fraction maps were created using a
conventional method. Convolutional neural networks, more specifically 2D
U-nets, were trained using 5-fold cross-validation with 1 or several echoes as
input, using the squared difference between the output and the reference fat
fraction maps as the loss function. The outputs of the networks were assessed
by the loss function, measured liver fat fractions, and visually. Training was
performed using a graphics processing unit (GPU). Inference was performed using
the GPU as well as a central processing unit (CPU).
  Results: The loss curves indicated convergence, and the final loss of the
validation data decreased when using more echoes as input. The liver fat
fractions could be estimated using only 1 echo, but results were improved by
use of more echoes. Visual assessment found the quality of the outputs of the
networks to be similar to the reference even when using only 1 echo, with
slight improvements when using more echoes. Training a network took at most
28.6 h. Inference time of a whole-body scan took at most 3.7 s using the GPU

  Conclusion: It is possible to perform water-fat signal separation of
whole-body gradient echo scans using convolutional neural networks. Separation
was possible using only 1 echo, although using more echoes improved the
results.

the LOCalization And TrAcking (LOCATA) challenge. The tasks of stationary
sources and arrays were considered, i.e., tasks 1 and 2 of the challenge, which
were recorded with the Nao robot array, and the Eigenmike array. For both
arrays, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation has been performed with
measurements in the short time Fourier transform domain, and with direct-path
dominance (DPD) based tests, which aim to identify time-frequency (TF) bins
dominated by the direct sound. For the recordings with Nao, a DPD test which is
applied directly to the microphone signals was used. For the Eigenmike
recordings, a DPD based test designed for plane-wave density measurements in
the spherical harmonics domain was used. After acquiring DOA estimates with TF
bins that passed the DPD tests, a stage of k-means clustering is performed, to
assign a final DOA estimate for each speaker.

it can capture partial information and enlarge the receptive field of filters
simultaneously without introducing extra parameters. Secondly, we propose
Tree-structured Feature Aggregation (TFA) module which follows a recursive rule
to expand and forms a hierarchical structure. Thus, it can naturally learn
representations of multi-scale objects and encode hierarchical contextual

approach for an ultrafast generation of a field-free vector potential that is
tunable in duration, sign, and magnitude, allowing to impart non-invasive,
spatio-temporally controlled changes to the quantum nature of nanosystems. The
method relies on triggering a steady-state toroidal moment in a donut-shaped
nanostructure that serves as a vector-potential generator and quantum phase
modulator. Irradiated by moderately intense, few cycle THz pulses with
appropriately shaped polarization states, the nano donut is brought to a
steady-state where a nearby object does not experience electric nor magnetic
fields but feels the photo-generated vector potential. Designing the time
structure of the driving THz pulses allows for launching picosecond trains of
vector potentials which is the key for a contact-free optimal control of
quantum coherent states. During the toroidal moment rise up time radiation is
emitted which can be tuned in a very broad frequency band. We carry out
full-fledged quantum dynamic simulations, and theoretical analysis to
illuminate the underlying principles and to endorse the feasibility,
robustness, and versatility of the scheme. This research could trigger a new
class of ultrafast quantum devices operated and switched in an

continue to be the basis for describing the allostery in an array of systems.
However, understanding allosteric signaling and the associated dynamics between
distinct allosteric states is challenging. In this review, we first describe
symmetry and rigidity as essential requirements for allosteric proteins. The
general features, with MWC and KNF as two extreme scenarios, emerge when
allosteric signaling is viewed from an energy landscape perspective. To go
beyond the general theories, we describe computational tools to predict the
network of residues that carry allosteric signals. Methods to obtain molecular
insights into the dynamics of allosteric transitions are briefly mentioned. The
utility of the methods is illustrated by applications to systems ranging from
monomeric proteins to multisubunit proteins. Finally, the role allostery plays
in the functions of ATP-consuming molecular machines, bacterial chaperonin
GroEL and molecular motors, is described. Although universal molecular
principles governing allosteric signaling do not exist, we can draw the
following general conclusions. (1) Multiple pathways connecting allosteric
states are highly heterogeneous. (2) Allosteric signaling is exquisitely
sensitive to the architecture of the system, which implies that the capacity
for allostery is encoded in the structure itself. (3) The mechanical modes that
connect distinct allosteric states are robust to sequence variations. (4)
Extensive investigations of allostery in Hemoglobin and more recently GroEL,
show that a network of salt-bridge rearrangements serves as allosteric
switches.

While the rigid primitives offer great ease of use to savvy programmers, they

develop STEP, a novel distributed framework based on in-memory key-value store.
The key idea of STEP is to adapt multi-threading in a single machine to a
distributed environment. STEP enables users to take fine-grained control over
distributed threads and apply task-specific optimizations in a flexible manner.
The underlying key-value store serves as distributed shared memory to keep
globally shared data. To ensure ease-of-use, STEP offers plentiful effective
interfaces in terms of distributed shared data manipulation, cluster

we use $BVIJH$ photometry and optical spectroscopy of 24 SNe II during the
photospheric phase. To correct photometry for extinction and redshift effects,
we compute total-to-selective broadband extinction ratios and $K$-corrections
up to $z=0.032$. To estimate host galaxy colour excesses, we use the
colour-colour curve method with the $V\!-\!I$ versus $B\!-\!V$ as colour
combination. We calibrate the PMM using four SNe II in galaxies having Tip of
the Red Giant Branch distances. Among our 24 SNe II, nine are at $cz>2000$ km
s$^{-1}$, which we use to construct Hubble diagrams (HDs). To further explore
the PMM distance precision, we include into HDs the four SNe used for
calibration and other two in galaxies with Cepheid and SN Ia distances. With a
set of 15 SNe II we obtain a HD rms of 0.13 mag for the $J$-band, which
compares to the rms of 0.15-0.26 mag for optical bands. This reflects the
benefits of measuring PMM distances with near-IR instead of optical photometry.
With the evidence we have, we can set the PMM distance precision with $J$-band
below 10 per cent with a confidence level of 99 per cent.

detailed information about stellar interiors. This is essential to improve the
quality of the results obtained from asteroseismology as it will provide better
stellar models which in turn can be used to refine inferences made in
exoplanetology and galactic archaeology. Methods: The presented method -
WhoSGlAd - relies on Gram-Schmidt's orthogonalisation process. A Euclidean
vector subspace of functions is defined and the oscillation frequencies are
projected over an orthonormal basis in a specific order. This allows the
obtention of independent coefficients that we combine to define independent
seismic indicators. Results: The developed method has been shown to be stable
and to converge efficiently for solar-like pulsators. Thus, detailed and
precise inferences can be obtained on the mass, the age, the chemical
composition and the undershooting in the interior of the studied stars.

seems to be a degeneracy between the influence of the helium abundance and that
of the heavy elements on the glitch amplitude. As an example, we analyse the

between ejecta velocity and plateau brightness, i.e. the standard candle
method, to obtain a distance of 18.2$\pm$1.2 Mpc, which is in very good
agreement with measurements based on geometric methods. The above distance
implies a mid-plateau absolute magnitude of $M_{V}^{50}=-15.76\pm$0.14
suggesting that it is of intermediate brightness when compared to IIP SNe such
as SN 2005cs at the faint end, and more typical events such as SN 1999em. This
is further supported by relatively low expansion velocities (Fe II
$\lambda$5169 $\sim$3000 km s$^{-1}$ at +42 d). Using archival HST/WFC3 imaging
data, we find a point source coincident with the supernova position in the

investigate vacancy diffusion in Ni-Re, Ni-W, and Ni-Ta binary alloys up to 10
at.% solute concentration. We introduce an interaction model that takes into
account the chemical environment close to the diffusing atom to capture the
effect of solute-host and solute-solute interactions on the diffusion barriers.
In contrast to an ideal solid solution it is not only the diffusion barrier of
the solute atom that influences the vacancy mobility, but primarily the change
in the host diffusion barriers due to the presence of solute atoms. This is
evidenced by the fact that the observed vacancy slowdown as a function of
solute concentration is larger in Ni-W than in Ni-Re, even though Re is a
slower diffuser than W. To model diffusion in complex, non-dilute alloys an
explicit treatment of interaction energies is thus unavoidable. In the context
of Ni-based superalloys two conclusions can be drawn from our kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations: the observed slowdown in vacancy mobility is not sufficient
to be the sole cause for the so-called Re-effect; and assuming a direct
correlation between vacancy mobility, dislocation climb, and creep strength the
experimentally observed similar effect of W and Re in enhancing creep strength
can be confirmed.

assumption that individuals are independently affected by treatments or
exposures. However, recently there has been increasing interest in settings,
such as social networks, where individuals may interact with one another such
that treatments may spill over from the treated individual to their social
contacts and outcomes may be contagious. Existing models proposed for causal
inference using observational data from networks of interacting individuals
have two major shortcomings. First, they often require a level of granularity
in the data that is practically infeasible to collect in most settings, and
second, the models are high-dimensional and often too big to fit to the

parameterization for network data with interference and contagion. Our
parameterization corresponds to a particular family of graphical models known
as chain graphs. We argue that, in some settings, chain graph models
approximate the marginal distribution of a snapshot of a longitudinal data

brought important constraints on their internal rotation rates. To correctly
reproduce these data, an efficient transport mechanism is needed in addition to
meridional circulation and shear instability. Aims: We study the efficiency of
the transport of angular momentum during the subgiant phase. Results: The
precise asteroseismic measurements of both core and surface rotation rates
available for the six Kepler targets enable a precise determination of the
efficiency of the transport of angular momentum needed for each of these
subgiants. These results are found to be insensitive to all the uncertainties
related to the modelling of rotational effects before the post-main sequence
phase. An interesting exception in this context is the case of young subgiants
(typical values of log(g) close to 4), because their rotational properties are
sensitive to the degree of radial differential rotation on the main sequence.
These young subgiants constitute therefore perfect targets to constrain the
transport of angular momentum on the main sequence from asteroseismic
observations of evolved stars. As for red giants, we find that the efficiency
of the additional transport process increases with the mass of the star during
the subgiant phase. However, the efficiency of this undetermined mechanism
decreases with evolution during the subgiant phase, contrary to what is found
for red giants. Consequently, a transport process with an efficiency that
increases with the degree of radial differential rotation cannot account for
the core rotation rates of subgiants, while it correctly reproduces the
rotation rates of red giant stars. This suggests that the physical nature of
the additional mechanism needed for the internal transport of angular momentum
may be different in subgiant and red giant stars.

feature of the proposed nanoscale symmetric plasmonic configuration.
Reflectionless ENZ transmission and perfect loss-compensation are realized at
the EP which coincides with the effective ENZ resonance wavelength of the
proposed array of active plasmonic waveguides. When we further increase the
gain coefficient of the dielectric material loaded in the slits, a spectral
singularity occurs at the ENZ resonance leading to super scattering (lasing)
response at both forward and backward directions. These interesting effects are
achieved by materials characterized by very small gain coefficients with
practical values and at subwavelength scales due to the strong and homogeneous
field enhancement inside the active slits at the ENZ resonance leading to
enhanced light-matter interaction. We theoretically analyze the obtained EP, as
well as the divergent spectral singularity, using a transmission-line model and
investigate the addition of a second incident wave and nonlinearities in the
response of the proposed active ENZ plasmonic system. Our findings provide a
novel route towards interesting nanophotonic applications, such as

means of preventing fault-propagation and a system-wide blackout. However,

capability of VSC-HVDC links, a new controlled islanding model is put forward
for an AC/VSC-HVDC hybrid grid to minimize the composite power-flow disruption,
in which the DC-terminals belonging to a VSC-HVDC link are placed in different

approach is proposed by transforming the problem into a weighted undirected

islanding solution in real time such that the power exchanges between islands
are implemented via a VSC-HVDC link to reduce the generation-load imbalance.
The simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus system and a real-world system verify
the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

a Bernoulli process. Due to the link capacity constraint, it takes multiple
time slots for the source to complete the transmission of an update. Therefore,
when a new update arrives at the source during the transmission of another
update, the source needs to decide whether to skip the new arrival or to switch
to it, in order to minimize the expected average age of information (AoI) at
the destination. We start with the setting where all updates are of the same
size, and prove that within a broadly defined class of online policies, the
optimal policy should be a renewal policy, and has a sequential switching
property. We then show that the optimal decision of the source in any time slot
has threshold structures, and only depends on the age of the update being
transmitted and the AoI at the destination. We then consider the setting where
updates are of different sizes, and show that the optimal Markovian policy also
has a multiple-threshold structure. For each of the settings, we explicitly
identify the thresholds by formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP), and solve it through value iteration. Special structural properties of
the corresponding optimal policy are utilized to reduce the computational
complexity of the value iteration algorithm.

hardware complexity and power consumption. Targeting at this problem, this
article introduces a novel hardware-efficient hybrid precoding/combining
architecture, which only employs a limited number of simple phase over-samplers
(POSs) and a switch (SW) network to achieve maximum hardware efficiency while
maintaining satisfactory spectral efficiency performance. The POS can be
realized by a simple circuit and simultaneously outputs several parallel
signals with different phases. With the aid of a simple switch network, the
analog precoder/combiner is implemented by feeding the signals with appropriate
phases to antenna arrays or RF chains. We analyze the design challenges of this
POS-SW-based hybrid beamforming architecture and present potential solutions to
the fundamental issues, especially the precoder/combiner design and the channel
estimation strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that this
hardware-efficient structure can achieve comparable spectral efficiency but
much higher energy efficiency than that of the traditional structures.

classification problems. Actions are assessed according to multiple criteria
and assigned to one or more categories. A set of reference actions is used for
defining each category. The assignment of an action to a given category depends
on the comparison of the action to each reference set according to likeness
thresholds. Distinct sets of criteria weights, interaction coefficients, and
likeness thresholds can be defined per category. We propose to apply Multiple
Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) to Cat-SD. An adapted MCHP is proposed to
take into account possible interaction effects between criteria structured in a
hierarchical way. On the basis of the known deck of cards method, we also
consider an imprecise elicitation of parameters permitting to take into account
interactions and antagonistic effects between criteria. The elicitation
procedure we are proposing can be applied to any Electre method. With the
purpose of exploring the assignments obtained by Cat-SD considering possible
sets of parameters, we propose to apply the Stochastic Multicriteria
Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). The SMAA methodology allows to draw statistical
conclusions on the classification of the actions. The proposed method,
SMAA-hCat-SD, helps the decision maker to check the effects of the variation of
parameters on the classification at different levels of the hierarchy. We
propose also a procedure, based on the concept of loss function, to obtain a
final classification fulfilling some requirements given by the decision maker

dozens of processing cores running in parallel to enhance computational
efficiency. Although we use parallel computing, the procedure remains
computationally challenging since thousands of samples need to be drawn and

several computationally expensive engineering problems which motivate its use

surrogate models can speed up parallel tempering Bayeslands by developing
computationally inexpensive models to mimic expensive ones. In this paper, we
apply surrogate-assisted parallel tempering where that surrogate mimics a

both theoretically and empirically that the global anchor method is equivalent
to the alignment method, a widely-used method for comparing word embeddings, in
terms of detecting corpus-level language shifts. Despite their equivalence in

superior in terms of applicability as it can compare embeddings of different
dimensionalities. Furthermore, the global anchor method has implementation and
parallelization advantages. We show that the global anchor method reveals fine

targeted individuals and wider society, and also risks reputational damage for

detect and classify Islamophobic hate speech at scale. Previous research has
largely approached the detection of Islamophobic hate speech on social media as
a binary task. However, the varied nature of Islamophobia means that this is
often inappropriate for both theoretically-informed social science and
effectively monitoring social media. Drawing on in-depth conceptual work we
build a multi-class classifier which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic,
weak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content. Accuracy is 77.6% and
balanced accuracy is 83%. We apply the classifier to a dataset of 109,488
tweets produced by far right Twitter accounts during 2017. Whilst most tweets
are not Islamophobic, weak Islamophobia is considerably more prevalent (36,963
tweets) than strong (14,895 tweets). Our main input feature is a gloVe word

outperforms a generic word embeddings model by 5.9 percentage points,
demonstrating the importan4ce of context. Unexpectedly, we also find that a

  Communications","10 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Device-to-device (D2D) communications is expected to play a significant role
in increasing the system capacity of the fifth generation (5G) wireless
networks. To accomplish this, efficient power and resource allocation
algorithms need to be devised for the D2D users. Since the D2D users are
treated as secondary users, their interference to the cellular users (CUs)
should not hamper the CU communications. Most of the prior works on D2D
resource allocation assume full channel state information (CSI) at the base
station (BS). However, the required channel gains for the D2D pairs may not be
known. To acquire these in a fast fading channel requires extra power and
control overhead. In this paper, we assume partial CSI and formulate the D2D
power and resource allocation problem as a multi-armed bandit problem. We
propose a power allocation scheme for the D2D users in which the BS allocates
power to the D2D users if a certain signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) is maintained for the CUs. In a single player environment a D2D user
selects a CU in every time slot by employing UCB1 algorithm. Since this
resource allocation problem can also be considered as an adversarial bandit
problem we have applied the exponential-weight algorithm for exploration and
exploitation (Exp3) to solve it. In a multiple player environment, we extend
UCB1 and Exp3 to multiple D2D users. We also propose two algorithms that are
based on distributed learning algorithm with fairness (DLF) and kth-UCB1
algorithms in which the D2D users are ranked. Our simulation results show that
our proposed algorithms are fair and achieve good performance.
