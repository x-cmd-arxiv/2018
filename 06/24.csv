non-convex optimization problems using a linear and a nonlinear optimizer, full
MPC performance is compared to both linearized MPC and a standard on/off

featuring a non-Lipschitz singularity at the origin. Solutions of such systems
exist globally and are unique up until the first time they hit the origin, $t =
t_b$, which we term `blowup'. However, infinitely many solutions may exist for
longer times. To study continuation past blowup, we introduce physically
motivated regularizations: they consist of smoothing the vector field in a
$\nu$--ball around the origin and then removing the regularization in the limit
$\nu\to 0$. We show that this limit can be understood using a certain
autonomous dynamical system obtained by a solution-dependent renormalization
procedure. This procedure maps the pre-blowup dynamics, $t < t_b$, to the
solution ending at infinitely large renormalized time. In particular, the
asymptotic behavior as $t \nearrow t_b$ is described by an attractor. The
post-blowup dynamics, $t > t_b$, is mapped to a different renormalized solution
starting infinitely far in the past. Consequently, it is associated with
another attractor. The $\nu$-regularization establishes a relation between
these two different ""lives"" of the renormalized system. We prove that, in some
generic situations, this procedure selects a unique global solution (or a
family of solutions), which does not depend on the details of the
regularization. We provide concrete examples and argue that these situations
are qualitatively similar to post-blowup scenarios observed in
infinite-dimensional models of turbulence.

oversampling technique by intentionally introducing a timing mismatch between

comprehensively study the impact of timing error on the ANOMA throughput

using highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) action with 2+1+1 dynamical

functions is controlled by including up to three-states in the spectral
decomposition. Remaining systematic uncertainties associated with lattice
discretization, lattice volume and light-quark masses are controlled using a
simultaneous fit in these three variables. Our final estimates of the isovector

results with respect the case $K=0.5$ besides than a small change in the zero

transverse distribution of partons in protons, and parton distribution
functions. We perform our test at different charge-particle multiplicities and
collision energies. The MC models, which describe many features of the LHC

combining human insights with machine learning techniques, which facilitate the
use of crowdsourcing to enlist label information both effectively and
efficiently. The classic work on crowdsourcing mainly focuses on the label
inference problem under the categorization setting. However, inferring the true
label requires sophisticated aggregation models that usually can only perform
well under certain assumptions. Meanwhile, no matter how complicated the
aggregation model is, the true model that generated the crowd labels remains
unknown. Therefore, the label inference problem can never infer the ground
truth perfectly. Based on the fact that the crowdsourcing labels are abundant
and utilizing aggregation will lose such kind of rich annotation information
(e.g., which worker provided which labels), we believe that it is critical to
take the diverse labeling abilities of the crowdsourcing workers as well as
their correlations into consideration. To address the above challenge, we
propose to tackle three research problems, namely inference, learning, and

of mass $M$ and spin $S = aM^2$, it is simple to characterize its orbits as
functions of the orbit's geometry. How do the orbits change if the black hole
is itself evolving? How do the orbits change if the orbiting body evolves? In
this paper, we consider a process that changes a black hole's mass and spin,
acting such that the spacetime is described by the Kerr solution at any moment,
or that changes the orbiting body's mass. Provided this change happens slowly,
the orbit's actions ($J_r, J_\theta, J_\phi$) are {\it adiabatic invariants},
and thus are constant during this process. By enforcing adiabatic invariance of
the actions, we deduce how an orbit evolves due to changes in the black hole's
mass and spin and in the orbiting body's mass. We demonstrate the impact of
these results with several examples: how an orbit responds if accretion changes
a black hole's mass and spin; how it responds if the orbiting body's mass
changes due to accretion; and how the inspiral of a small body into a black
hole is affected by change to the hole's mass and spin due to the gravitational
radiation absorbed by the event horizon. In all cases, the effect is very
small, but can be an order of magnitude or more larger than what was found in
previous work which did not take into account how the orbit responds due to
these effects.

theories (GUTs) such as $\text{SU}(5)$ and $\text{SO}(10)$ by means of
considering two complex singlet fields with conformal invariance. In this
framework, inflation emerges from a spontaneously broken conformal symmetry.
The GUT symmetry implies a potential with a CW form, as a consequence of
radiative corrections. The conformal symmetry flattens the above VEV branch of
the CW potential to a Starobinsky plateau. As a result, we obtain $n_{s}\sim
1-\frac{2}{N}$ and $r\sim \frac{12}{N^2}$ for $N\sim 50-60$ e-foldings.
Furthermore, this framework allow us to estimate the proton lifetime as
$\tau_{p}\lesssim 10^{40}$ years, whose decay is mediated by the superheavy
gauge bosons. Moreover, we implement a type I seesaw mechanism by weakly
coupling the complex singlet, which carries two units of lepton number, to the
three generations of singlet right handed neutrinos (RHNs). The spontaneous
symmetry breaking of global lepton number amounts to the generation of neutrino
masses. We also consider non-thermal leptogenesis in which the inflaton
dominantly decays into heavy RHNs that sources the observed baryon asymmetry.
We constrain the couplings of the inflaton field to the RHNs, which gives the
reheating temperature as $10^{6}\text{ GeV}\lesssim T_{R}<10^{9}$ GeV.

disagreement exists between the two, which should have been formed with the
same chemical composition. We found that the primary is slightly supersolar (by
~+0.1dex) while the secondary is subsolar (by several tenths dex) for heavier
elements such as Fe, resulting in a marked discrepancy between the primary and
secondary, though such a trend is not seen for light elements (e.g., C or O).
These observational facts suggest that anomalously large [X/Fe] ratios found in
Li-rich giants were mainly due to an apparent decrease of Fe abundance, which
we speculate is caused by the overionization effect due to chromospheric UV
radiation. We thus conclude that conventional model atmosphere analysis would
fail to correctly determine the abundances of fast-rotating giants of high
activity, for which proper treatment of chromospheric effect is required for
deriving true photospheric abundances.

the lack of examples simple enough so that they can be thoroughly understood
theoretically, but complex enough to be realistic. We constructed an example of
structured data, motivated by problems from image-to-text conversion (OCR),
which requires long-term memory to decode. Our data is a simple writing system,
encoding characters 'X' and 'O' as their upper halves, which is possible due to
symmetry of the two characters. The characters can be connected, as in some
languages using cursive, such as Arabic (abjad). The string 'XOOXXO' may be
encoded as
'${\vee}{\wedge}\kern-1.5pt{\wedge}{\vee}\kern-1.5pt{\vee}{\wedge}$'. It
follows that we may need to know arbitrarily long past to decode a current
character, thus requiring long-term memory. Subsequently we constructed an RNN
capable of decoding sequences encoded in this manner. Rather than by training,
we constructed our RNN ""by inspection"", i.e. we guessed its weights. This
involved a sequence of steps. We wrote a conventional program which decodes the
sequences as the example above. Subsequently, we interpreted the program as a
neural network (the only example of this kind known to us). Finally, we
generalized this neural network to discover a new RNN architecture whose
instance is our handcrafted RNN. It turns out to be a 3 layer network, where
the middle layer is capable of performing simple logical inferences; thus the
name ""deductron"". It is demonstrated that it is possible to train our network
by simulated annealing. Also, known variants of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) methods are shown to work.

high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we bring geometry processing to bear
on manifold learning by introducing a new approach based on metric connection
for generating a quasi-isometric, low-dimensional mapping from a sparse and
irregular sampling of an arbitrary manifold embedded in a high-dimensional
space. Geodesic distances of discrete paths over the input pointset are
evaluated through ""parallel transport unfolding"" (PTU) to offer robustness to
poor sampling and arbitrary topology. Our new geometric procedure exhibits the
same strong resilience to noise as one of the staples of manifold learning, the
Isomap algorithm, as it also exploits all pairwise geodesic distances to
compute a low-dimensional embedding. While Isomap is limited to
geodesically-convex sampled domains, parallel transport unfolding does not
suffer from this crippling limitation, resulting in an improved robustness to
irregularity and voids in the sampling. Moreover, it involves only simple
linear algebra, significantly improves the accuracy of all pairwise geodesic
distance approximations, and has the same computational complexity as Isomap.
Finally, we show that our connection-based distance estimation can be used for
faster variants of Isomap such as L-Isomap.

greater than $N$. In these situations, applying DL techniques would lead to

  Here we aim to improve classification of various diseases with metagenomic

we identify a propensity field, which is responsible for the chiral response in

equivalent to the Berry curvature in a two-band solid. The propensity field
directly encodes optical propensity rules, extending our conclusions regarding
the role of propensity rules in defining the sign of forward-backward asymmetry
from the specific case of chiral hydrogen to generic chiral systems. Optical
propensity rules underlie the chiral response in photoelectron circular
dichroism. The enantiosensitive flux of the propensity field through the sphere
in momentum space determines the forward-backward asymmetry in unaligned
molecules and suggests a geometrical origin of the chiral response. This flux
has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers and vanishes for achiral molecules.

matrix convex combinations is that the $g$-tuples $X, Y$, and $V_1^* XV_1+V_2^*

dimension free analog of convex sets.
  While in the classical setting there is only one notion of an extreme point,
there are three main notions of extreme points for matrix convex sets:
ordinary, matrix, and absolute extreme points. Absolute extreme points are
closely related to the classical Arveson boundary. A central goal in the theory
of matrix convex sets is to determine if one of these types of extreme points
for a matrix convex set minimally recovers the set through matrix convex
combinations.
  This article shows that every real compact matrix convex set which is defined
by a linear matrix inequality is the matrix convex hull of its absolute extreme
points, and that the absolute extreme points are the minimal set with this
property. Furthermore, we give an algorithm which expresses a tuple as a matrix
convex combination of absolute extreme points with optimal bounds. Similar
results hold when working over the field of complex numbers rather than the
reals.

Junction-based crossbars have garnered significant interest for implementing
the weights of an artificial neural network. The existence of only two stable
states in MTJs implies a high overhead of obtaining optimal binary weights in
software. We illustrate that the inherent parallelism in the crossbar structure
makes it highly appropriate for in-situ training, wherein the network is taught
directly on the hardware. It leads to significantly smaller training overhead
as the training time is independent of the size of the network, while also
circumventing the effects of alternate current paths in the crossbar and
accounting for manufacturing variations in the device. We show how the
stochastic switching characteristics of MTJs can be leveraged to perform
probabilistic weight updates using the gradient descent algorithm. We describe
how the update operations can be performed on crossbars both with and without
access transistors and perform simulations on them to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our techniques. The results reveal that stochastically trained
MTJ-crossbar NNs achieve a classification accuracy nearly same as that of
real-valued-weight networks trained in software and exhibit immunity to device

efforts to assist app developers in building secure apps. These efforts have
resulted in tools and techniques capable of detecting vulnerabilities (and
malicious behaviors) in apps. However, there has been no evaluation of the
effectiveness of these tools and techniques in detecting known vulnerabilities.
The absence of such evaluations puts app developers at a disadvantage when
choosing security analysis tools to secure their apps. In this regard, we
evaluated the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools for Android apps.
We reviewed 64 tools and empirically evaluated 14 vulnerability detection tools
(incidentally along with five malicious behavior detection tools) against 42
known unique vulnerabilities captured by Ghera benchmarks, which are composed
of both vulnerable and secure apps. Of the 24 observations from the evaluation,
the main observation is existing vulnerability detection tools for Android apps
are very limited in their ability to detect known vulnerabilities -- all of the
evaluated tools together could only detect 30 of the 42 known unique
vulnerabilities. More effort is required if security analysis tools are to help
developers build secure apps. We hope the observations from this evaluation
will help app developers choose appropriate security analysis tools and
persuade tool developers and researchers to identify and address limitations in
their tools and techniques. We also hope this evaluation will catalyze or spark
a conversation in the software engineering and security communities to require
a more rigorous and explicit evaluation of security analysis tools and

providing insights on compensation distribution to job seekers, so that they
can make more informed decisions when discovering and assessing career
opportunities. The compensation insights are provided based on data collected
from LinkedIn members and aggregated in a privacy-preserving manner. Given the
simultaneous desire for computing robust, reliable insights and for having
insights to satisfy as many job seekers as possible, a key challenge is to
reliably infer the insights at the company level when there is limited or no
data at all. We propose a two-step framework that utilizes a novel, semantic
representation of companies (Company2vec) and a Bayesian statistical model to
address this problem. Our approach makes use of the rich information present in
the LinkedIn Economic Graph, and in particular, uses the intuition that two
companies are likely to be similar if employees are very likely to transition
from one company to the other and vice versa. We compute embeddings for
companies by analyzing the LinkedIn members' company transition data using
machine learning algorithms, then compute pairwise similarities between
companies based on these embeddings, and finally incorporate company
similarities in the form of peer company groups as part of the proposed
Bayesian statistical model to predict insights at the company level. We perform
extensive validation using several different evaluation techniques, and show
that we can significantly increase the coverage of insights while, in fact,
even improving the quality of the obtained insights. For example, we were able
to compute salary insights for 35 times as many title-region-company

designed a DAQ system suitable for high-speed and high-precision sampling for
remote data transfer. An 8-channel, 24-bit simultaneous sampling
analog-to-digital converter(ADC) named AD7779 was utilized for high-speed and
high-precision sampling, the maximum operating speed of which runs up to 16
kilo samples per second(KSPS). ADC is responsible for collecting signals from
detectors, which is sent to Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) for processing
and long-distance transmission to the workstation through optical fiber. As the
central processing unit of DAQ system, FPGA provides powerful computing
capability and has enough flexibility. The most prominent feature of the system
is real-time mass data transfer based on streaming transmission mode, highly
reliable data transmission based on error detection and correction and
high-speed high-precision data acquisition. The results of our tests show that
the system is able to transmit data stably at the bandwidth of 1Gbps.

  Research (JMRR)",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetically-anchored surgical devices have recently gained attention in
abdominal surgery, with the use of magnets to anchor surgical devices onto the
insufflated abdominal wall. These anchors have been used to secure passive and
active devices, where active device such as robotic manipulators produce
motions that would excite the dynamics of the non-rigid abdominal wall. Hence,
there is a need to investigate the mechanical dynamics of the abdominal wall
tissue in insufflated state, combined with magnetic anchoring, specifically its
response to mechanical excitations and the expected disturbances to the
operation of the anchored devices. In this paper, loading and unloading tests
are performed on a corresponding porcine specimen for dynamics identification.
The experiment setup was constructed to emulate the insufflated state of the
abdomen with the magnetically anchored mechanism. The tissue responses during
unloading are captured and approximated with a general numerical model, which
is in turn used for the dynamic analysis of the tissue using Bode plot. The
results showed that in such stretched and compressed state, the steady state
displacement of the tissue is approximately zero. The maximum transient error
was found to be 1mm in displacement using a high magnetic anchoring force.
Significant attenuation of the disturbances due to the high stiffness and
damping of the abdominal wall, was observed from 100rad/s in the frequency
response. If a robotic manipulator was attached to the anchoring device, the
typical operating frequency of movements would still produce unattenuated
disturbances. It is expected that some error compensation through suitable
control strategies is required. These outcomes establish the basis for the
controller design and the design specification of the active
magnetically-anchored surgical devices for minimal disturbance impact onto the
abdominal wall tissue.

networks (F-RAN) is investigated. Taking into account time-variant user
requests and ultra-dense deployment of fog access points (F-APs), we propose a
dynamic distributed edge caching scheme to jointly minimize the request service
delay and fronthaul traffic load. Considering the interactive relationship
among F-APs, we model the caching optimization problem as a stochastic
differential game (SDG) which captures the temporal dynamics of F-AP states and
incorporates user requests status. The SDG is further approximated as a mean
field game (MFG) by exploiting the ultra-dense property of F-RAN. In the MFG,
each F-AP can optimize its caching policy independently through iteratively
solving the corresponding partial differential equations without any
information exchange with other F-APs. The simulation results show that the
proposed edge caching scheme outperforms the baseline schemes under both static
and time-variant user requests.

from several well-known issues, such as vanishing and exploding gradients,

often requires large scale datasets for training before being fine-tuned on
small-to-medium scale problems. Activity, or, in other words, action
recognition, is one of many application areas of deep learning. While there

joints is often performed via recurrent networks such as LSTM.
  In this paper, we propose a new representation which encodes sequences of 3D
body skeleton joints in texture-like representations derived from
mathematically rigorous kernel methods. Such a representation becomes the first
layer in a standard CNN network e.g., ResNet-50, which is then used in the
supervised domain adaptation pipeline to transfer information from the source
to target dataset. This lets us leverage the available Kinect-based data beyond
training on a single dataset and outperform simple fine-tuning on any two
datasets combined in a naive manner. More specifically, in this paper we
utilize the overlapping classes between datasets. We associate datapoints of
the same class via so-called commonality, known from the supervised domain

first developed a headline and link extractor that parses select websites, and

shallower than the local $M_\text{Bulge}-M_\text{BH}$ relation. The S\'ersic

propose to get the complete subgraphs through indirect searching for the
maximal complete subgraphs for the sake of a reduced searching complexity.
Furthermore, by using the complete subgraphs so obtained, a weighted graph is
constructed. By setting the weights of the vertices of the weighted graph to be
the incremental offloaded traffics of their corresponding complete subgraphs,
the original clustering optimization problem can be transformed into an
equivalent 0-1 integer programming problem. The max-weight independent subset
of the vertex set of the weighted graph, which is equivalent to the objective
cluster sets, can then be readily obtained by solving the above optimization
problem through the greedy algorithm that we propose. Our proposed graph-based
approach has an apparently low complexity in comparison with the brute force
approach which has an exponential complexity. Simulation results show the
remarkable improvements in terms of offloading gain by using our proposed
approach.

to quantify the irreversibility of open systems. Its positivity can be ensured

sometimes. This is often taken as an indicator of non-Markovian dynamics. We
make this link precise by showing under which conditions a negative entropy
production rate implies non-Markovian dynamics and when it does not. This is
established within a unified language for two setups: (i) the dynamics
resulting from a coarse-grained description of a system in contact with a

research problem. The goal is to derive a distributed algorithm in which each
agent obtains a local estimate of its own subset of the global parameter
vector, based on local measurements as well as information received from its
neighbours. A recent algorithm has been proposed, which yields the optimal
solution (i.e., the one that would be obtained using a centralized method) in
finite time, provided the communication network forms an acyclic graph. If
instead, the graph is cyclic, the only available alternative algorithm, which
is based on iterative matrix inversion, achieving the optimal solution, does so
asymptotically. However, it is also known that, in the cyclic case, the
algorithm designed for acyclic graphs produces a solution which, although non
optimal, is highly accurate. In this paper we do a theoretical study of the
accuracy of this algorithm, in communication networks forming cyclic graphs. To
this end, we provide bounds for the sub-optimality of the estimation error and
the estimation error covariance, for a class of systems whose topological
sparsity and signal-to-noise ratio satisfy certain condition. Our results show
that, at each node, the accuracy improves exponentially with the so-called
loop-free depth. Also, although the algorithm no longer converges in finite
time in the case of cyclic graphs, simulation results show that the convergence
is significantly faster than that of methods based on iterative matrix
inversion. Our results suggest that, depending on the loop-free depth, the
studied algorithm may be the preferred option even in applications with cyclic
communication graphs.

that of the Rh substrate, and is limited by molecular hydrogen evolution on the
negative and by oxidative removal on the positive side. From copper upd on
pristine h-BN/Rh(111) wafer samples, we estimate a collective defect fraction
on the order of 0.08-0.7% of the geometric area, which may arise from line and
point defects in the h-BN layer that are created during its chemical vapour
deposition. Overpotential deposition (opd) is demonstrated to have significant
consequences on the defect area. We hypothesise that this non-innocent Cu
electrodeposition involves intercalation originating at initial defects,
causing irreversible delamination of the h-BN layer; this effect may be used
for 2D material nanoengineering. On the relevant timescale, upd itself does not
alter the defect area on repeated cycling; therefore, metal upd may find use as

and quantum probability does not satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms. We show, by
considering the macroscopic contexts associated with measurement procedures and
the microscopic contexts (mu-contexts) underlying them, that one can interpret
quantum probability as epistemic, despite its non-Kolmogorovian structure. To
attain this result we introduce a predicate language L(x), a classical
probability measure on it and a family of classical probability measures on
sets of mu contexts, each element of the family corresponding to a
(macroscopic) measurement procedure. By using only Kolmogorovian probability
measures we can thus define mean conditional probabilities on the set of
properties of any quantum system that admit an epistemic interpretation but are
not bound to satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms. The generalized probability measures
associated with states in QM can then be seen as special cases of these mean
probabilities, which explains how they can be non-classical and provides them
with an epistemic interpretation. Moreover, the distinction between compatible
and incompatible properties is explained in a natural way, and purely
theoretical classical conditional probabilities coexist with empirically
testable quantum conditional probabilities.

the phaseless far-field patterns generated by infinitely many sets of
superpositions of two plane waves with different directions at a fixed
frequency under the a priori assumption that the obstacle is known to be a
sound-soft or non-absorbing impedance obstacle and the index of refraction $n$

scattering system together with a simpler method of using Rellich's lemma and
Green's representation formula for the scattering solutions. Further, our new
method is also used to prove uniqueness in determining a locally rough surface

pattern shared among different ecosystems. Measurements give power law exponent
to be between 1 and 2, and more often to cluster around 2, whereas theoretical
models predict TL exponent can assume any real value. In this paper, adopting
the framework of multiplicative growth models in a Markovian environment, we
investigate the possibility of evolutionary strategies to be responsible for TL
exponent to be in a finite range. We implement three different strategies the
individuals can follow and for each strategy set two different optimization
investment objectives. In all the studied cases we find TL exponent can assume
any real value due to the existence of regions of the model parameters in which
the exponent can diverge. Furthermore, under natural hypothesis on the dynamics
of the environment, the shapes of these regions do not depend on different
strategies adopted and nor on the optimization objective. Thus the introduction
of strategies dose not affect the range of TL exponent in the model. In our
theoretical framework rare events are shaping the value of the TL exponent,

$N$ of the system, with the average strain interval before the first plastic
event, $\overline{\Delta\gamma}$, scaling like $N^\alpha$ with $\alpha$
negative: larger samples are more susceptible to plasticity due to more
numerous disorder-induced soft spots. In this paper we examine this scaling
relation in ultra-stable glasses prepared with the Swap Monte Carlo algorithm,
with regard to the possibility of protocol-dependent scaling exponent, which
would also imply a protocol dependence in the distribution of local yield
stresses in the glass. We show that, while a superficial analysis seems to

attained based on state-injection of the server's non-Gaussian supplies. The
protocol is automatically blind because the non-Gaussian resource requested to
the server is always the same, regardless of the specific computation.
Verification, in turn, is possible thanks to an efficient non-Gaussian state
fidelity test where we assume identical state preparation by the server. It is
based on Gaussian measurements by the client on the injected states, which is
potentially interesting on its own. The division of quantum hardware between

various quantum information processing tasks. In particular, in
measurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct graph states are
generated is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification
protocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are
particularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a
single state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol
currently known requires $O(n^{15})$ copies of the state, where $n$ is the size
of the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more
resource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires
$O(n^5\log{n})$ copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a
probability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling's bound also
enables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph
states. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for them is
non-trivial. For example, the previous verification protocols for qubit graph
states that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit
and continuous-variable graph states without tremendously increasing the
resource overhead. This is because the overhead caused by the quantum de
Finetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our
protocol, the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and
therefore generalizing to qudit or continuous-variable graph states does not
increase the overhead. The flexibility of Serfling's bound also makes our
protocol robust: our protocol accepts slightly noisy but still useful graph
states.

two-user downlink with strictly heterogeneous latency constraints. To cope with
the latency constraints and to explicitly specify the trade-off between
blocklength (latency) and reliability the normal approximation of the capacity
of finite blocklength codes (FBCs) is adopted, in contrast to the classical
Shannon capacity formula. We first consider the non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) based transmission scheme. However, due to heterogeneous latency
constraints and channel conditions at receivers, the conventional successive
interference cancellation may be infeasible. We thus study the problem by
considering heterogeneous receiver conditions under different interference
mitigation schemes and solve the corresponding NOMA design problems. It is
shown that, though the energy function is not convex and does not have closed
form expression, the studied NOMA problems can be globally solved
semi-analytically and with low complexity. Moreover, we propose a hybrid
transmission scheme that combines the time division multiple access (TDMA) and
NOMA. Specifically, the hybrid scheme can judiciously perform bit and time
allocation and take TDMA and NOMA as two special instances. To handle the more
challenging hybrid design problem, we propose a concave approximation of the
FBC rate/capacity formula, by which we obtain computationally efficient and
high-quality solutions. Simulation results show that the hybrid scheme can
achieve considerable transmission energy saving compared with both pure NOMA
and TDMA schemes.

calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment at LHC. This sampling calorimeter uses
steel plates as absorber and scintillating tiles as active medium. The light
produced by the passage of charged particles is transmitted by wavelength
shifting fibers to photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs), located in the outer part of
the calorimeter. The readout is segmented into about 5000 cells, each one being
read out by two PMTs in parallel. To calibrate and monitor the stability and
performance of the full readout chain during the data taking, a set of
calibration sub-systems is used. The TileCal calibration system comprises
Cesium radioactive sources, laser, charge injection elements, and an integrator
based readout system. Combined information from all systems allows to monitor
and to equalize the calorimeter response at each stage of the signal evolution,
from scintillation light to digitization. Calibration runs are monitored from a
data quality perspective and used as a crosscheck for physics runs. Data
quality in physics runs is monitored extensively and continuously. Any problems
are reported and immediately investigated. The data quality efficiency achieved
was 99.6% in 2012, 100% in 2015, 98.9% in 2016 and 99.4% in 2017.
  Based on LHC Run-I experience, all calibration systems were improved for
Run-II. TileCal performance during LHC Run-II, (2015-2017), is discussed,
including calibration, stability, absolute energy scale, uniformity and time
resolution. Results show that the TileCal performance is within the design
requirements and has given essential contribution to reconstructed objects and
physics results.

the difference method in time and the standard Galerkin FEM are employed. Based
on the linearized Crank-Nicolson difference method in time and the standard
Galerkin finite element method with bilinear element in space, the
time-discrete and space-time discrete systems are both constructed. We focus on
a rigorous analysis and consideration of unconditional superconvergence error
estimates of the discrete schemes. Firstly, by virtue of the temporal error
results, the regularity for the time-discrete system is presented. Secondly,
the classical Ritz projection is used to obtain the spatial error with order
$O(h^2)$ in the sense of $L^2-$norm. Thanks to the relationship between the
Ritz projection and the interpolated projection, the superclose estimate with
order $O(\tau^2 + h^2)$ in the sense of $H^1-$norm is derived. Thirdly, it
follows from the interpolated postprocessing technique that the global
superconvergence result is deduced. Finally, some numerical results are
provided to confirm the theoretical analysis.

routes is crucial for planning new bicycle paths or recommending routes to
bicyclists. This is becoming more and more important as city councils are
becoming increasingly aware of limitations of the transport infrastructure and
problems related to automobile traffic. Since different groups of cyclists have
different preferences, however, searching for a single set of criteria is prone
to failure. Therefore, in this paper, we present a new approach to classify
trajectories recorded and shared by bicyclists into different groups and, for
each group, to identify favored and unfavored road types. Based on these
results we show how to assign weights to the edges of a graph representing the
road network such that minimum-weight paths in the graph, which can be computed
with standard shortest-path algorithms, correspond to adequate routes. Our
method combines known algorithms for machine learning and the analysis of
trajectories in an innovative way and, thereby, constitutes a new comprehensive
solution for the problem of deriving routing preferences from initially
unclassified trajectories. An important property of our method is that it
yields reasonable results even if the given set of trajectories is sparse in
the sense that it does not cover all segments of the cycle network.

measurement. Activation energy of phase transition increases from 120KJ/mol
(x=0) to 140 KJ/mol (x=0.046) due to Ga-V co-doping. In anatase phase, lattice
constants increase by the effect of Ga3+ interstitials. This results in
inhibition of phase transition. Anatase phase becomes stable up to ~650 C in
co-doped sample whereas for pure TiO2 phase transition starts in between
450-500 C. In anatase phase, strain increases due to co-doping which reduces
crystallite size. In rutile phase, grain growth process is enhanced due to
co-doping and particles show a rod-like structure with majority 110 facets.
Bandgap decreases in both phases and reduced to a visible light region. BET
analysis shows that surface area increases from 4.55 m2/g (x=0) to 96.53 m2/g

Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors. The on-detector trigger electronics
modules are able to identify muons with predefined transverse momentum values
(pT) by executing a coincidence logic on signals coming from the various
detector layers. Then, on-detector trigger boards transfer trigger data to the
off-detector electronics. A complex trigger system processes the incoming data
by combining trigger information from the Barrel and the End-cap regions, and
by providing the combined muon candidate to the Central Trigger Processor
(CTP). For almost a decade, the Level-1 Trigger system has been operating very
well, despite the challenging requirements on trigger efficiency and
performance, and the continuously increasing LHC luminosity. In order to cope
with these constraints, various upgrades for the full trigger system were
already deployed, and others have been designed to be installed in the next
years. Most of the upgrades to the trigger system rely on state-of-the-art
technologies, thus allowing to increase the processing power and data transfer
bandwidth, and to design more complex trigger menus. As a consequence, more
trigger candidates might be selected by the system, thus supporting new physics
studies or topological selections. In this work, we discuss the design of the
first prototype of the new Barrel Interface Board, designed around a Xilinx
FPGA, which will be used to transfer RPC trigger data to the CTP system. The
main requirement for the board is to support the optical transmission of the
trigger data with fixed latency and to allow the implementation of new trigger

benchmark the perturbation calculations with the in-medium similarity
renormalization group (IM-SRG) which is a nonperturbative method. In the HF
basis some-type perturbation diagrams can be cancelled out, while the
cancellation does not happen in the harmonic-oscillator basis. We have
investigated the {\it sd} shell using the chiral N$^3$LO potential softened by
$V_{\text{low-}k}$. With the low-momentum N$^3$LO potential, we first perform
the spherical HF calculations for the $^{16}$O core of the {\it sd} shell, and
the realistic effective two-body interactions for the HF {\it sd}-shell space
can be derived by the perturbation calculations. The calculations give
simultaneously effective single-particle energies and excitation spectra of two
valence particle systems (i.e., $^{18}$O, $^{18}$F, and $^{18}$Ne in the {\it
sd} shell). Convergences have been analyzed order by order. The perturbation
calculations are in fairly good agreement with nonperturbative method IM-SRG.
We find that the HF RS perturbation gives even better results compared with the
BW perturbation. The HF realistic effective interactions derived by the
perturbations can be used for further shell-model calculations.

is usually obtained using multi-reference perturbation (MRPT) or configuration
interaction (MRCI) methods with internal contraction (ic) approximation. These
methods can use active space scalable to relatively larger size references than
has previously been possible. However, they are still hardly applicable to
systems with active space larger than 30 orbitals because of high computation
and storage costs of high-order reduced density matrices (RDMs) and the number
of virtual orbitals are normally limited to few hundreds. In this work, we
propose a new effective implementation of DMRG-MRCI, in which we use
re-constructed CASCI-type configurations from DMRG wave function via the
entropy-driving genetic algorithm (EDGA), and integrate with MRCI by an
external contraction (ec) scheme. This bypasses the bottleneck of computing
high-order RDMs in traditional DMRG dynamic correlation methods with ic
approximation and the number of MRCI configurations is not dependent on the
number of virtual orbitals. Therefore, DMRG-ec-MRCI method is promising for
dealing with larger active space than 30 orbitals and large basis sets. We
demonstrate the capability of our DMRG-ec-MRCI method in several benchmark
applications, including the evaluation of potential energy curve of Cr$_{2}$,
single-triplet gaps of higher n-acene molecules and the energy of

applied to the Multichannel Wiener Filter (MWF) for preservation of the spatial
subjective sensation of diffuse noise fields, is proposed here to both preserve
and emphasize the ITD binaural cues of a directional acoustic noise source. It
is demonstrated that the previously developed MWF-ITD technique may decrease
the original IC magnitude of the processed noise, consequently increasing the
variance of the interaural phase difference (IPD) of the output signals. It is
shown that the MWF-IC technique concomitantly minimizes a nonlinear function of
the difference between input and output IPD, which is strictly related to ITD,
and preserves the natural coherence of the directional noise captured by the
reference microphones. Objective measures and psychoacoustic experiments
corroborate the theoretical findings, showing the MWF-IC technique provides
relevant noise reduction, while preserving the original ITD subjective
perception and original lateralization for a directional noise source. These
results are especially relevant for hearing aid designers, since they indicate
the MWF-IC as a noise reduction technique that provides resid-ual noise spatial
preservation for both diffuse and directional noise sources in frequencies

noisy spectra without the need for additional preprocessing. However, their
application in practical spectroscopy is limited due to two shortcomings. The
effectiveness of the classification using CNNs drops rapidly when only a small
number of spectra per substance are available for training (which is a typical
situation in real applications). Additionally, to accommodate new, previously
unseen substance classes, the network must be retrained which is
computationally intensive. Here we address these issues by reformulating a
multi-class classification problem with a large number of classes, but a small
number of samples per class, to a binary classification problem with sufficient
data available for representation learning. Namely, we define the learning task
as identifying pairs of inputs as belonging to the same or different classes.
We achieve this using a Siamese convolutional neural network. A novel sampling
strategy is proposed to address the imbalance problem in training the Siamese
Network. The trained network can effectively classify samples of unseen
substance classes using just a single reference sample (termed as one-shot
learning in the machine learning community). Our results demonstrate better
accuracy than other practical systems to date, while allowing effortless
updates of the system's database with novel substance classes.

elementary processes of the same kind, especially the radioactive decay, are
considered as quantum clocks. By adapting the framework of the previously
introduced concept of ideal quantum clocks, the time operator for these systems
is derived and discussed. It is shown that the standard deviation of time
measurement by such a stochastic device is bounded from below by the limitation
of the number of elementary processes from physical reasons and by the
Planck-time. As a result, any time dilatation, whether caused by extreme speed
of the quantum clock or by gravitational fields, increases the standard
deviation. This reduces the accuracy of time measurements especially in space
navigation. In the vicinity of the Schwarzschild spherical shell of a black
hole, time measurements are completely blurred and thus impossible.

five-dimensional sources are present: the solutions are Ricci-flat in five
dimensions. Electromagnetic degrees of freedom are assumed not to be excited,
consequently the four-dimensional stress-energy tensor induced by dimensional
reduction is entirely due to the scalar field, obeying the radiation equation
of state. For the three choices of curvature index, the dependence of the scale
factor on cosmic time corresponds to, for k = -1 either a bounce or big bang,
for k = 0 a big bang, and for k = 1 a big bang followed by collapse. The
Kretschmann scalar is proportional to the square of acceleration and approaches
zero for k = -1 and k = 0, while revealing true singularities in some cases.
Only one of the models exhibits the compactification behavior hoped for in a
realistic K-K model: shrinking of the circumference of fifth dimension in the
earliest times followed by an extended period of stability.

these difficulties and modeling the signatures efficiently, we propose a method
that a one-class classifier per each user is built on discriminative features.
First, we pre-train a sparse auto-encoder using a large number of unlabeled
signatures, then we applied the discriminative features, which are learned by
auto-encoder to represent the training and testing signatures as a self-thought
learning method (i.e. we have introduced a signature descriptor). Finally,
user's signatures are modeled and classified using a one-class classifier. The
proposed method is independent on signature datasets thanks to self-taught
learning. The experimental results indicate significant error reduction and
accuracy enhancement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods on SVC2004 and

dissipative dielectric slab of finite thickness. While this problem is easily
solved via interface field continuity, we treat it under the viewpoint of
radiative self-consistency, with interior current sources gauged by
ohmic/polarization comparisons against those of the exterior medium. Radiative
self-consistency yields an integral equation over the slab field giving a fully
constructive buildup of the reflected/transmitted contributions, without any
need for implicit determination via boundary conditions. Solution steps lead to
an exact cancellation of the interior field, and bring in still other
contributions of a reference medium variety, required to balance the incoming
excitation. Such balancing provides the linear conditions for slab field
determination. This two-step solution provides evidence of Ewald-Oseen
extinction, even though the analytic framework here differs from the proofs
available. We solve the balancing equations by vector manipulation without
determinants, and then offer a boundary value confirmation in the special case
of perpendicular incidence. In an appendix, we allow the the upper/lower half
spaces to differ, the upper serving as reference and remote launch site of the
incoming excitation. Effective currents now exist both within the slab and
throughout an entire half space, necessitating a provision for cross-talk
between slab and the radiating half space. The appendix provides an accelerated
presentation of these generalized features, but stops short of an explicit
field solution by reason of algebraic inflation. All logical details are
however displayed in plain view. The self-consistency program is far more
