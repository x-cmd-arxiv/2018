through multi-method fusion. Existing multi-method studies focus on proposing a
single quality estimator. On the contrary, we investigate the generalizability
of multi-method fusion as a framework. In addition to support vector machines
that are commonly used in the multi-method fusion, we propose using neural
networks in the boosting. To span different types of image quality assessment
algorithms, we use quality estimators based on fidelity, perceptually-extended
fidelity, structural similarity, spectral similarity, color, and learning. In
the experiments, we perform k-fold cross validation using the LIVE, the
multiply distorted LIVE, and the TID 2013 databases and the performance of
image quality assessment algorithms are measured via accuracy-, linearity-, and
ranking-based metrics. Based on the experiments, we show that boosting methods
generally improve the performance of image quality assessment and the level of
improvement depends on the type of the boosting algorithm. Our experimental
results also indicate that boosting the worst performing quality estimator with
two or more additional methods leads to statistically significant performance
enhancements independent of the boosting technique and neural network-based
boosting outperforms support vector machine-based boosting when two or more
methods are fused.

dipolar dark excitons (upper layer) and bright ones (bottom layer). We
demonstrate that the interlayer interaction leads to a mixing between
excitations from different layers. This mixing leads to the appearance of a
second spectral branch in the spectrum of bright condensate. The excitation
spectrum of the condensate of dark dipolar excitons then becomes optically
accessible during luminescence spectra measurements of the bright condensate,
which allows one to probe its kinetic properties. This approach is relevant for
experimental setups, where detection via conventional techniques remains
challenging; in particular, the suggested method is useful for studying dark
dipolar excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.

genetic clues into disease biology, and they have revealed strong genetic
correlations among many diseases and traits. Some of these genetic correlations
may reflect causal relationships. We developed a method to quantify causal
relationships between genetically correlated traits using GWAS summary
association statistics. In particular, our method quantifies what part of the
genetic component of trait 1 is also causal for trait 2 using mixed fourth
moments $E(\alpha_1^2\alpha_1\alpha_2)$ and $E(\alpha_2^2\alpha_1\alpha_2)$ of
the bivariate effect size distribution. If trait 1 is causal for trait 2, then
SNPs affecting trait 1 (large $\alpha_1^2$) will have correlated effects on
trait 2 (large $\alpha_1\alpha_2$), but not vice versa. We validated this
approach in extensive simulations. Across 52 traits (average $N=331$k), we
identified 30 putative genetically causal relationships, many novel, including
an effect of LDL cholesterol on decreased bone mineral density. More broadly,
we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between genetic correlation
and causation using genetic association data.

We study the convergence of the loss from the system, a function of the total

volatility converges to a limiting distribution and the convergence of the

mean reversion of the volatility goes to infinity we see a stronger form of
convergence of the system to its limit. Our results show that in a fast

spatio-temporal features (instead of using independent spatial and temporal
streams). The temporal component is learned from the feature space instead of
pixel space, e.g. optical flow. The produced features can be flexibly used in
conjunction with other long-temporal modeling networks, e.g. ST-CNN,
DilatedTCN, and ED-TCN. Overall, our proposed approach robustly outperforms the
original long-temporal models on two fine-grained action datasets: 50 Salads

the PHD/CPHD filters, the TPHD/TCPHD filters are able to produce trajectory
estimates from first principles. The TPHD filter is derived by recursively
obtaining the best Poisson multitrajectory density approximation to the
posterior density over the alive trajectories by minimising the
Kullback-Leibler divergence. The TCPHD is derived in the same way but
propagating an independent identically distributed (IID) cluster
multitrajectory density approximation. We also propose the Gaussian mixture
implementations of the TPHD and TCPHD recursions, the Gaussian mixture TPHD
(GMTPHD) and the Gaussian mixture TCPHD (GMTCPHD), and the L-scan
computationally efficient implementations, which only update the density of the
trajectory states of the last L time steps.

expected that a larger continuous symmetry could emerge at the DQCP, which, if

the emergent current fluctuation in the spin excitation spectra, we can
quantitatively study the current-current correlation in large-scale quantum

drive reversals of current sheet polarity leading to time-dependent Oscillatory
Reconnection, which is a possible explanation of how periodic phenomena can be
generated when reconnection occurs in the solar atmosphere. However, the
details of what controls the period of these oscillations is poorly understood,
despite being crucial in assessing whether OR can account for observed periodic
behaviour. This paper aims to highlight that different types of reconnection
reversal are supported about null points, and that these are distinct from the
oscillation on the closed-boundary, linear systems considered in the 1990s. In
particular, we explore the features of a nonlinear oscillation local to the
null point, and examine the effect of resistivity and perturbation energy on
the period, contrasting it to the linear case. It is found that in the linear
systems, the inverse Lundquist number dictates the period, provided the
perturbation energy is small relative to the inverse Lundquist number defined
on the boundary, regardless of the broadband structure of the initial
perturbation. However, when the perturbation energy exceeds the threshold
required for 'nonlinear' null collapse to occur, a complex oscillation of the
magnetic field is produced which is, at best, only weakly-dependent on the
resistivity. The resultant periodicity is strongly influenced by the amount of
free energy, with more energetic perturbations producing higher-frequency
oscillations. Crucially, with regards to typical solar-based and
astrophysical-based input energies, we demonstrate that the majority far exceed
the threshold for nonlinearity to develop. This substantially alters the
properties and periodicity of both null collapse and subsequent OR. Therefore,
nonlinear regimes of OR should be considered in solar and astrophysical
contexts.

First, we discuss why the area under the conventional Kendall curve ($\AUK$)

meaningful extension of the definition of the $\K$-plots and define an index of
dependence that is based on $\AUK$. This measure characterizes a wide range of
two-variable relationships, thereby completely detecting the underlying
dependence structure. Properties of the proposed index satisfy the mathematical
definition of a measure. Finally, simulations and real data examples illustrate
the applicability of the proposed method.

neutron transfer, which is quantum tunneling of weakly bounded neutron from one
nucleus to another. I estimate the rate of this process for fixed nuclei
separation and then average the result over realistic distribution of nuclei to
get the rate value for astrophysical conditions. The neutron transfer can
modify reaction chains in accreting neutron stars, thus affecting their heating
and cooling. In particular, it can suppress cooling by URCA pairs of nuclei,
which is supposed to be crucial for the hottest neutron stars.

infer parametric linear temporal logic (pLTL) formulas that are informative and

non-interacting bandwidth $W$. For both repulsive and attractive weak

which involve the coupling of a deexcitation operator to a single-excitation

of many-body auxiliary wave functions for excited states is also addressed. For
each of these approaches we were interested in deriving the elements of the

integrals involving one-determinant quantum electronic states on which two or
three pairs of second quantization operators can act. Such a decomposition has
been done according to a corollary to Wick's theorem, which is brought in a

the two types of excited-state calculation methods (with and without coupling

mechanism known classically as self-tuning. The self-tuning is a way to address
the cosmological constant problem by allowing a partial break of symmetry in
the scalar field sector. The Fab Four is the most general set of self-tuning
scalar-tensor gravitational theories in four dimensions. The minisuperspace
Hamiltonian thus obtained from this combination of Fab Four terms has
fractional powers in the momenta, leading to a problem in applying canonical
quantization. We have solved this problem by generalizing the canonical

learning resource mention hyperlinking and categorization will facilitate

novel problem of learning resource mention identification in MOOC forums. As
this is a novel task with no publicly available data, we first contribute a
large-scale labeled dataset, dubbed the Forum Resource Mention (FoRM) dataset,
to facilitate our current research and future research on this task. We then
formulate this task as a sequence tagging problem and investigate solution
architectures to address the problem. Importantly, we identify two major
challenges that hinder the application of sequence tagging models to the task:
(1) the diversity of resource mention expression, and (2) long-range contextual
dependencies. We address these challenges by incorporating character-level and
thread context information into a LSTM-CRF model. First, we incorporate a
character encoder to address the out-of-vocabulary problem caused by the
diversity of mention expressions. Second, to address the context dependency
challenge, we encode thread contexts using an RNN-based context encoder, and
apply the attention mechanism to selectively leverage useful context
information during sequence tagging. Experiments on FoRM show that the proposed
method improves the baseline deep sequence tagging models notably,
significantly bettering performance on instances that exemplify the two
challenges.

Smoothed Particle Magneto-Hydrodynamics (SPMHD) schemes, especially
highlighting the impact of a hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme and
artificial resistivity switch on the magnetic field evolution in cosmological
simulations of the formation of a galaxy cluster using the N-body/SPMHD code

schemes for the artificial resistivity switch is demonstrated via idealized
test cases and cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that the hyperbolic
divergence cleaning scheme is effective at suppressing the growth of the
numerical divergence error of the magnetic field and should be applied to any
SPMHD simulation. Although the artificial resistivity is important in the
strong field regime, it can suppress the growth of the magnetic field in the
weak field regime, such as galaxy clusters. With sufficient resolution,
simulations with divergence cleaning can reproduce observed magnetic fields. We
conclude that the cleaning scheme alone is sufficient for galaxy cluster

field performance of Nb$_{3}$Sn, making it suitable for dipole magnets for
Future Circular Collider (FCC). A big challenge for the FCC is that a realistic
production target for FCC Nb3Sn requires ~30% improvement over current
conductor performance. Recent success with internal oxidation(IO) of Nb-Zr
precursor has shown significant improvement in the layer J$_{c}$ of Nb$_{3}$Sn
wires, albeit the complication of providing an internal O$_{2}$ diffusion path
and avoiding degradation of irreversibility field($_{irr}$). We compare Zr and
Hf additions to the standard Nb4Ta alloy of maximum H$_{c2}$ and H$_{irr}$.
Nb4Ta rods with 1Zr or 1Hf were made into monofilament wires with and without
SnO$_{2}$ and their properties measured over the entire superconducting range
up to 31 T. We found that group IV alloying of Nb4Ta raises H$_{irr}$, though
adding O$_{2}$ still degrades this slightly. As noted in Nb1Zr studies, the
pinning force density F$_{p}$ is strongly enhanced and its peak value shifted
to higher field by IO. A surprising result of this work is that we found better
properties in Nb4Ta1Hf without SnO$_{2}$, F$_{pmax}$ achieving 2.35 times that
of the standard Nb4Ta alloy, while the oxidized Nb4Ta1Zr alloy achieved 1.54
times that of the Nb4Ta alloy. The highest layer J$_{c}$ (16 T, 4.2 K) of 3700
A/mm$^{2}$ was found in the SnO$_{2}$-free wire made with Nb4Ta1Hf alloy. Using
a standard A15 cross-section fraction of 60% for modern PIT and RRP wires, we
estimated that a non-Cu J$_{c}$ of 2200 A/mm$^{2}$ is obtainable in modern
conductors, well above the 1500A/mm$^{2}$ FCC specification. Moreover, the best

how much we could lose if we query $b$ points at a time for $t$ iterations,
instead of one point at a time for $bt$ iterations. We then introduce a novel
approach to nonmyopic approximations of the optimal policy that admits
efficient computation. Our proposed policy can automatically trade off
exploration and exploitation, without relying on any tuning parameters. We also
generalize our policy to batch setting, and propose two approaches to tackle

charged particles interacting with electromagnetic fluctuations whose
frequencies are smaller than the particles' cyclotron frequencies. This type of
heating arises when the amplitude of the gyroscale fluctuations exceeds a
certain threshold, causing particle orbits in the plane perpendicular to the
magnetic field to become stochastic rather than nearly periodic. We consider
the stochastic heating of protons by Alfv\'en-wave (AW) and
kinetic-Alfv\'en-wave (KAW) turbulence, which may make an important
contribution to the heating of the solar wind. Using phenomenological
arguments, we derive the stochastic-proton-heating rate in plasmas in which
$\beta_{\rm p} \sim 1-30$, where $\beta_{\rm p}$ is the ratio of the proton
pressure to the magnetic pressure. (We do not consider the $\beta_{\rm p}
\gtrsim 30$ regime, in which KAWs at the proton gyroscale become
non-propagating.) We test our formula for the stochastic-heating rate by
numerically tracking test-particle protons interacting with a spectrum of
randomly phased AWs and KAWs. Previous studies have demonstrated that at
$\beta_{\rm p} \lesssim 1$, particles are energized primarily by time
variations in the electrostatic potential and thermal-proton gyro-orbits are
stochasticized primarily by gyroscale fluctuations in the electrostatic
potential. In contrast, at $\beta_{\rm p} \gtrsim 1$, particles are energized
primarily by the solenoidal component of the electric field and thermal-proton
gyro-orbits are stochasticized primarily by gyroscale fluctuations in the

combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling, here we
demonstrate that this transition originates from the competition between
growth-induced in-plane active stresses and vertical restoring forces, due to
the cell-substrate interactions. Using a simple chainlike colony of laterally
confined cells, we show that the transition sets when individual cells become
unstable to rotations, thus it is localized and mechanically deterministic.
Asynchronous cell division renders the process stochastic, so that all the
critical parameters that control the onset of the transition are continuously
distributed random variables. Here we demonstrate that the occurrence of the
first division in the colony can be approximated as a Poisson process in the
limit of large cells numbers. This allows us to approximately calculate the
probability distribution function of the position and time associated with the
first extrusion. The rate of such a Poisson process can be identified as the
order parameter of the transition, thus highlighting its mixed
deterministic-stochastic nature.

flux of a bounded, divergenceless vector field, through the corresponding
region. Our work leads to two main results: (i) We present a general algorithm
that allows the construction of explicit thread configurations in cases where
the minimal surface is known. We illustrate the method with simple examples:
spheres and strips in vacuum AdS, and strips in a black brane geometry.
Studying more generic bulk metrics, we uncover a sufficient set of conditions

model situations where a decision maker controls a system based on its state.
Partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are generalizations of
MDPs where the decision maker has only partial information on the state of the
system. Decomposable POMDPs are specific cases of POMDPs that enable one to
model systems with several components. Such problems naturally model a wide
range of applications such as predictive maintenance. Finding an optimal policy
for a POMDP is PSPACE-hard and practically challenging. We introduce a mixed
integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for POMDPs restricted to the
policies that only depend on the current observation, as well as valid
inequalities that are based on a probabilistic interpretation of the dependence
between variables. The linear relaxation provides a good bound for the usual
POMDPs where the policies depend on the full history of observations and
actions. Solving decomposable POMDPs is especially challenging due to the curse
of dimensionality. Leveraging our MILP formulation for POMDPs, we introduce a
linear program based on ``fluid formulation'' for decomposable POMDPs, that
provides both a bound on the optimal value and a practically efficient
heuristic to find a good policy. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of
our approaches to POMDPs and decomposable POMDPs.

  Project page: https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/haq/",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model quantization is a widely used technique to compress and accelerate deep
neural network (DNN) inference. Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to
support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation
efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for
each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading
off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both
time-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the
different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way.
In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ)
framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine
the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the
design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size,
we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and
energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is
fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural
network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively
reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with
negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits)
quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different
hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different
resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy and model size) are drastically
different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies,
which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware
architecture design.

high-intensity laser experiments from first principles. We employ our method to
simulate photonic signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity in laser pulse

spiral galaxies with comparable luminosities outside the LG. These correlations
do not appear to be expected in standard hierarchical galaxy formation. In this
contribution, and for the first time, we present a quantitative investigation
of the expectations of the standard model of cosmology for this possible
relation using a galaxy catalogue based on the Millennium-II simulation. Our
main sample consists of disk galaxies at the centers of halos with a range of
virial masses similar to M33, MW, and M31. For this sample, we find an average
trend (though with very large scatter) similar to the one observed in the LG;
disk galaxies in heavier halos on average host heavier bulges and larger number
of satellites. In addition, we study sub-samples of disk galaxies with very
similar stellar or halo masses (but spanning a range of 2-3 orders of magnitude
in bulge mass) and find no obvious trend in the number of satellites vs. bulge
mass. We conclude that while for a wide galaxy mass range a relation arises
(which seems to be a manifestation of the satellite number - halo mass
correlation), for a narrow one there is no relation between number of
satellites and bulge mass in the standard model. Further studies are needed to
better understand the expectations of the standard model for this possible

the thermofield double state can be understood as a modular inclusion of the
algebras of exterior operators. The effect of this deformation is the creation
of a new region of spacetime deep in the bulk, corresponding to a non-trivial
center between the left and right algebras. This set-up provides a precise
framework for investigating how black hole interiors are encoded in the CFT. In
particular, we use modular theory to demonstrate that state dependence is an
inevitable feature of any attempt to represent operators behind the horizon.
Building on this geometrical structure, we propose that modular inclusions may
provide a more precise means of investigating the nascent relationship between
entanglement and geometry in the context of the emergent spacetime paradigm.

atmospheres by targeting multiple water bands, in particular, those at 1.15 and
1.4 $\mu$m. Hubble Space Telescope observations suggest that this wavelength
region is relevant for distinguishing between hazy/cloudy and clear
atmospheres.
  Methods: We observed one transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with
CARMENES. Telluric and stellar absorption lines were removed using Sysrem,
which performs a principal component analysis including proper error
propagation. The residual spectra were analysed for water absorption with
cross-correlation techniques using synthetic atmospheric absorption models.
  Results: We report a cross-correlation peak at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of 6.6, revealing the presence of water in the transmission spectrum of HD
189733 b. The absorption signal appeared slightly blueshifted at -3.9 $\pm$ 1.3
kms$^{-1}$. We measured the individual cross-correlation signals of the water
bands at 1.15 and 1.4 $\mu$m, finding cross-correlation peaks at SNRs of 4.9
and 4.4, respectively. The 1.4 $\mu$m feature is consistent with that observed
with the Hubble Space Telescope.
  Conclusions: The water bands studied in this work have been mainly observed
in a handful of planets from space. The ability of also detecting them
individually from the ground at higher spectral resolution can provide
insightful information to constrain the properties of exoplanet atmospheres.
Although the current multiband detections can not yet constrain atmospheric
haze models for HD 189733 b, future observations at higher signal-to-noise
ratio could provide an alternative way to achieve this aim.

incomplete. It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the
stellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. We aim to
characterize the presence of physical companions in orbit around nearby stars.
Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion (PM) of their parent star
through their gravitational reflex motion. Using the Hipparcos catalog and
Gaia's second data release (GDR2), we determined the long-term PM of the stars
common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a PM anomaly (PMa) between
the long-term PM vector and the GDR2 (or Hipparcos) measurements, indicative of
the presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the
6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the
PMa for >99% of the Hipparcos catalog (>117000 stars). 30% of the stars studied
present a PMa greater than 3 sigmas. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting
companions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few
applications to interesting targets. We set upper limits of 0.1-0.3 M_Jup to
potential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (P_orb=3 to 100 years).
We confirm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to alpha Cen. We recover the
masses of the known companions of epsilon Eri, epsilon Ind, Ross 614 and beta
Pic. We also detect a possible planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting tau Ceti.
The combination of the GDR2 with Hipparcos results in very high accuracy PMa
vectors. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy of
sigma(Delta v_tan)=1.0 m/s per parsec of distance opens the possibility to
identify long period orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. Gaia's
complementarity to radial velocity and transit techniques already appears to be
remarkably powerful.

reach full thermodynamic equilibrium can be still be created in significant
amounts by rare SM collisions. This mechanism, called freeze-in, can proceed
through a renormalizable connector operator with a very small coefficient, or a
non-renormalizable connector operator suppressed by a large mass scale. In the
latter non-renormalizable scenario, the dominant creation of DM particles
typically occurs at the largest SM temperature attained during the radiation
era (assuming a standard cosmological history), and for this reason it is
referred to as ultraviolet freeze-in. We show that non-renormalizable operators
can also contribute importantly to the DM density at lower temperatures down to
below the mass of the DM particle. To do so, we compute the production,
annihilation, and freeze-out of DM in a simple dark sector consisting of a
massive Dirac fermion DM candidate coupled to a massless Abelian vector boson
with the only connection to the SM through the fermionic Higgs portal operator.
For a broad range of parameters in the theory, the dark sector is populated by
ultraviolet freeze-in in the usual way, self-thermalizes to a dark temperature
below that of the SM, and undergoes thermal freeze-out. We show that late
residual freeze-in reactions during the freeze-out process can further populate
the dark sector and increase the DM relic density beyond standard dark sector
freeze-out.

a lanthanide-poor ('blue') and lanthanide-rich ('red') component. The existence
of a blue component has been used as evidence for a HMNS remnant of finite
lifetime, but average disk outflow velocities from existing long-term HMNS
simulations fall short of the inferred value ($\sim 0.25c$) by a factor of
$\sim 2$. Here we use time-dependent, axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of
HMNS disks to explore the limits of the model and its ability to account for
observations. For physically plausible parameter choices compatible with
GW170817, we find that hydrodynamic models that use shear viscosity to
transport angular momentum cannot eject matter with mass-averaged velocities
larger than $\sim 0.15c$. While outflow velocities in our simulations can
exceed the asymptotic value for a steady-state neutrino-driven wind, the
increase in the average velocity due to viscosity is not sufficient. Therefore,
viscous HMNS disk winds cannot reproduce by themselves the ejecta properties
inferred from multi-component fits to kilonova light curves from GW170817.
Three possible resolutions remain feasible within standard merger ejecta
channels: more sophisticated radiative transfer models that allow for photon
reprocessing between ejecta components, inclusion of magnetic stresses, or
enhancement of the dynamical ejecta. We provide fits to our disk outflow models

inflaton matter-dominated epoch. During inflation, the dark scalar field
acquires a large expectation value due to a negative non-minimal coupling to
curvature, thus stabilizing the Higgs field by holding it at the origin. After
inflation, the dark scalar oscillates in a quartic potential, behaving as dark
radiation, and only when its amplitude drops below a critical value does the
Higgs field acquire a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The dark scalar then
becomes massive and starts behaving as cold dark matter until the present day.
We further show that consistent scenarios require dark scalar masses in the few

factor for ground-based spectroscopic observations and the near-infrared and
infrared regions are the most affected. Several software packages that produce
a synthetic atmospheric transmission spectrum have been developed to correct
for the telluric absorption; these are Molecfit, TelFit, and TAPAS. Aims. Our
goal is to compare the correction achieved using these three telluric
correction packages and the division by a telluric standard star. We want to
evaluate the best method to correct near-infrared high-resolution spectra as
well as the limitations of each software package and methodology. Methods. We
applied the telluric correction methods to CRIRES archival data taken in the J
and K bands. We explored how the achieved correction level varies depending on
the atmospheric T-P profile used in the modelling, the depth of the atmospheric
lines, and the molecules creating the absorption. Results. We found that the
Molecfit and TelFit corrections lead to smaller residuals for the water lines.
The standard star method corrects best the oxygen lines. The Molecfit package

0.5% for all lines; the offset is similar with TelFit and TAPAS for the H2O

simulation and conditional luminosity function (CLF) modeling. At these high
luminosities ($g < 20.85$ quasars), the MBII simulation volume
($100~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$ comoving boxsize) has only 3 quasar pairs at distances
of $1-4$ Mpc. The black-hole masses for the pairs range between
$M_{bh}\sim1-3\times 10^{9}~M_{\odot}/h$ and the quasar hosts are haloes of
$M_h\sim1-3\times10^{14}~M_{\odot}/h$. Such pairs show signs of recent major
mergers in the MBII simulation. By modeling the central and satellite AGN CLFs
as log-normal and Schechter distributions respectively (as seen in MBII AGNs),
we arrive at CLF models which fit the simulation predictions and observed
luminosity function and the small-scale clustering measured for the SDSS
sample. The small-scale clustering of our mock quasars is well-explained by
central-satellite quasar pairs that reside in $M_h>10^{14}~M_{\odot}/h$ dark
matter haloes. For these pairs, satellite quasar luminosity is similar to that
of central quasars. Our CLF models imply a relatively steep increase in the
maximum satellite luminosity, $L^*_{\mathrm{sat}}$, in haloes of
$M_h>10^{14}~M_{\odot}/h$ with associated larger values of $L^*_{\mathrm{sat}}$
at higher redshift. This leads to increase in the satellite fraction that
manifests itself in an enhanced clustering signal at $\lesssim$ 1 Mpc/h. For
the ongoing eBOSS-CORE sample, we predict $\sim 200-500$ quasar pairs at
$z\sim1.5$ (with $M_h \gtrsim10^{13}~M_{\odot}/h$ and $M_{bh}

Determining the boundary conditions for these lattice terminations, the energy

problem for healthcare industry. Traditional supervised learning methods
require a large number of labeled data which is usually expensive and difficult
to obtain for ECG signals. Active learning is well-suited for ECG signal
classification as it aims at selecting the best set of labeled data in order to
maximize the classification performance. Motivated by the fact that ECG data
are usually heavily unbalanced among different classes and the class labels are
noisy as they are manually labeled, this paper proposes a novel solution based
on robust active learning for addressing these challenges. The key idea is to
first apply the clustering of the data in a low dimensional embedded space and
then select the most information instances within local clusters. By selecting
the most informative instances relying on local average minimal distances, the
algorithm tends to select the data for labelling in a more diversified way.
Finally, the robustness of the model is further enhanced by adding a novel
noisy label reduction scheme after the selection of the labeled data.
Experiments on the ECG signal classification from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia
database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

a subsample of 320 disc galaxies, we successfully perform a simultaneous
fitting with a single S\'ersic model of the Herschel images in all five bands
using the multiband modelling code GALFITM. We report that the S\'ersic index
$n$, which characterises the shape of the S\'ersic profile, lies systematically
below 1 in all Herschel bands and is almost constant with wavelength. The
average value at 250{\mu}m is $0.67\pm0.37$ (187 galaxies are fitted with
$n_{250}\leq0.75$, 87 galaxies have $0.75<n_{250}\leq1.25$, and 46 - with
$n_{250}>1.25$). Most observed profiles exhibit a depletion in the inner region
(at $r<0.3-0.4$ of the optical radius $r_{25}$ ) and are more or less
exponential in the outer part. We also find breaks in the dust emission
profiles at longer distances $(0.5-0.6)r_{25}$ which are associated with the
breaks in the optical and near-infrared. We assume that the observed deficit of
dust emission in the inner galaxy region is related to the depression in the
radial profile of the HI surface density in the same region because the atomic
gas reaches high enough surface densities there to be transformed into
molecular gas. If a galaxy has a triggered star formation in the inner region
(for example, because of a strong bar instability, which transfers the gas
inwards to the centre, or a pseudobulge formation), no depletion or even an

i.e., the synchronization stability of VSCs under large disturbances, by
employing the phase portrait approach. Insights into the stabilizing effects of
the first- and second-order PLLs are provided with the quantitative analysis.
It is revealed that simply increasing the damping ratio of the second-order PLL
may fail to stabilize VSCs during severe grid faults, while the first-order PLL
can always guarantee the transient stability of VSCs when equilibrium operation
points exist. An adaptive PLL that switches between the second-order and the
first-order PLL during the fault-occurring/-clearing transient is proposed for
preserving both the transient stability and the phase tracking accuracy.
Time-domain simulations and experimental tests, considering both the grid fault

efficiently generated by direct forward passes though a learned generator. Most

that the generated samples progressively approach a target distribution, thus
it is called self-learning. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets

reduce a difficult problem to simple subproblems, so they are easy to implement

to problem conditions and can struggle to reach the desired accuracy. To
improve their performance, researchers have proposed techniques such as
diagonal preconditioning and inexact subproblems. This paper realizes
additional speedup about one order of magnitude.
  Specifically, we choose non-diagonal preconditioners that are much more
effective than diagonal ones. Because of this, we lose closed-form solutions to
some subproblems, but we found simple procedures to replace them such as a few
proximal-gradient iterations or a few epochs of proximal block-coordinate
descent, which are in closed forms. We show global convergence while fixing the
number of those steps in every outer iteration. Therefore, our method is
reliable and straightforward.
  Our method opens the choices of preconditioners and maintains both low
per-iteration cost and global convergence. Consequently, on several typical

  Presence of Impulsive Noise","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An Adaptive Nonlinear Differential Limiter (ANDL) is proposed in this paper
to efficiently alleviate the impact of impulsive noise (IN) in a communication
system. Unlike existing nonlinear methods, the ANDL is implemented in the
analog domain where the broader acquisition bandwidth makes outliers more
detectable and consequently it is easier to remove them. While the proposed
ANDL behaves like a linear filter when there is no outlier, it exhibits
intermittent nonlinearity in response to IN. Therefore, the structure of the
matched filter in the receiver is modified to compensate the filtering effect
of the ANDL in the linear regime. In this paper, we quantify the performance of
the ANDL by deriving a closed-form analytical bound for the average
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the filter. The calculation is
based on the idea that the ANDL can be perceived as a time-variant linear
filter whose bandwidth is modified based on the intensity of the IN. In
addition, by linearizing the filter time parameter variations, we treat the
ANDL as a set of linear filters where the exact operating filter at a given
time depends upon the magnitude of the outliers. The theoretical average bit
error rate (BER) is validated through simulations and the performance gains
relative to classical methods such as blanking and clipping are quantified.

alphabets and Gaussian symbols. A particle method for the computation of the
resulting achievable information rate and spectral efficiency (SE) is presented
and employed to lower-bound the channel capacity. The dependence of the SE on
the link length, amplifier spacing, and presence or absence of inline
dispersion compensation is studied. Single-polarization and dual-polarization
scenarios with either independent or joint processing of the two polarizations
are considered. Numerical results show that, in links with ideal distributed
amplification, an SE gain of about 1 bit/s/Hz/polarization can be obtained (or,
in alternative, the system reach can be doubled at a given SE) with respect to
single-carrier systems without PPN mitigation. The gain is lower with lumped
amplification, increases with the number of spans, decreases with the span
length, and is further reduced by in-line dispersion compensation. For
instance, considering a dispersion-unmanaged link with lumped amplification and
an amplifier spacing of 60 km, the SE after 80 spans can be be increased from
4.5 to 4.8 bit/s/Hz/polarization, or the reach raised up to 100 spans (+25%)

physically exist in a quantum system. Do observables such as energy and
position have meaningful values only at the precise moment of measurement, as
in the Copenhagen interpretation? Or is position always definite and guided by
the wave function, as in de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory? In the language of
Bell, what are the ""beables"" of quantum theory and what values may they take in
space and time? This is the quantum reality problem. A definitive answer
requires not just describing which physical quantities exist in a quantum
system, but describing what configurations of those quantities in space and
time are allowed, and with what probability those configurations occur. Adrian
Kent sets out a new vision of quantum theory along these lines. His
interpretation supplements quantum theory to infer the value of physical
quantities in spacetime from the asymptotic late-time behavior of the quantum
system. In doing so, a Lorentz-covariant and single-world solution to the
quantum reality problem is achieved. In this paper, the framework of Kent's
interpretation is presented from the ground up. After a broad overview, a
derivation of the generalized Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule is provided
before applying Kent's interpretation to toy model systems, in both
relativistic and non-relativistic settings. By adding figures and discussion, a
broad introduction is provided to Kent's proposed interpretation of quantum

malicious purposes, e.g., creating fear among the general public. A rich body
of work has focused on detecting photo tampering and manipulation by verifying
the integrity of image content. Instead, we aim to detect photo misuse by
verifying the capture time and location of photos. This paper is motivated by
the law of nature that sun position varies with the time and location, which
can be used to determine whether the claimed contextual information corresponds
with the sun position that the image content actually indicates. Prior
approaches to inferring sun position from images mainly rely on vanishing
points associated with at least two shadows, while we propose novel algorithms
which utilize only one shadow in the image to infer the sun position.
Meanwhile, we compute the sun position by applying astronomical algorithms
which take as input the claimed capture time and location. Only when the two
estimated sun positions are consistent can the claimed contextual information
be genuine. We have developed a prototype called IMAGEGUARD. The experimental
results show that our method can successfully estimate sun position and detect
the time-location inconsistency with high accuracy. By setting the thresholds
to be 9.4 degrees and 5 degrees for the sun position distance and the altitude
angle distance, respectively, our system can correctly identify 91.5% of
falsified photos with fake contextual information.

Detection Systems (IDS) and many factors contribute to this challenge. One such
challenge concerns establishing adequate boundaries and finding a proper data

need to be studied in depth and thoroughly investigated in order to extract the
required knowledge base. Another challenge involves implementing the binary
decision. This is because there are no reasonable limits between normal and
attack traffics patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel idea capable of
supporting the proper data source while avoiding the issues associated with the
binary decision. This paper aims to introduce a detection approach for defining
abnormality by using the Fuzzy Rule Interpolation (FRI) with Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB) parameters. The
strength of the proposed detection approach is based on adapting the SNMP-MIB
parameters with the FRI. This proposed method eliminates the raw traffic
processing component which is time consuming and requires extensive
computational measures. It also eliminates the need for a complete fuzzy rule
based intrusion definition. The proposed approach was tested and evaluated
using an open source SNMP-MIB dataset and obtained a 93% detection rate.
Additionally, when compared to other literature in which the same test-bed
environment was employed along with the same number of parameters, the proposed
detection approach outperformed the support vector machine and neural network.
Therefore, combining the SNMP-MIB parameters with the FRI based reasoning could
be beneficial for detecting intrusions, even in the case if the fuzzy rule
based intrusion definition is incomplete (not fully defined).

executable and low-cost task plans in a discrete space such that the (initially
unknown) action costs are determined by motion plans in a corresponding
continuous space. However, a task-motion plan can be sensitive to unexpected
domain uncertainty and changes, leading to suboptimal behaviors or execution
failures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TMP-RL, which is an
integration of TMP and reinforcement learning (RL) from the execution
experience, to solve the problem of robust task-motion planning in dynamic and
uncertain domains. TMP-RL features two nested planning-learning loops. In the
inner TMP loop, the robot generates a low-cost, feasible task-motion plan by
iteratively planning in the discrete space and updating relevant action costs
evaluated by the motion planner in continuous space. In the outer loop, the
plan is executed, and the robot learns from the execution experience via
model-free RL, to further improve its task-motion plans. RL in the outer loop
is more accurate to the current domain but also more expensive, and using less
costly task and motion planning leads to a jump-start for learning in the real
world. Our approach is evaluated on a mobile service robot conducting
navigation tasks in an office area. Results show that TMP-RL approach
significantly improves adaptability and robustness (in comparison to TMP
methods) and leads to rapid convergence (in comparison to task planning (TP)-RL
methods). We also show that TMP-RL can reuse learned values to smoothly adapt
to new scenarios during long-term deployments.

intimately connected with two fundamental vertices of the gauge sector of QCD:
the ghost-gluon vertex, which may be obtained from it through suitable
contraction, and the three-gluon vertex, whose Slavnov-Taylor identity contains
that kernel as one of its main ingredients. In this work we present a detailed
nonperturbative study of the five form factors comprising it, using as starting
point the `one-loop dressed' approximation of the dynamical equations governing
their evolution. The analysis is carried out for arbitrary Euclidean momenta,
and makes extensive use of the gluon propagator and the ghost dressing
function, whose infrared behavior has been firmly established from a multitude
of continuum studies and large-volume lattice simulations. In addition, special
Ans\""atze are employed for the vertices entering in the relevant equations, and
their impact on the results is scrutinized in detail. Quite interestingly, the
veracity of the approximations employed may be quantitatively tested by
appealing to an exact relation, which fixes the value of a special combination
of the form factors under construction. The results obtained furnish the two
form factors of the ghost-gluon vertex for arbitrary momenta, and, more
importantly, pave the way towards the nonperturbative generalization of the
Ball-Chiu construction for the longitudinal part of the three-gluon vertex.

molecular gas phase, traced by ro-vibrational transitions of $\rm H_2$, and
(2), the warm ionized medium, traced by the [Fe II]$_{1.644~\rm \mu m}$ line.
The [Fe II] emission traces shocked gas ejected from the disc plane by a
jet-blown bubble $300-400~\rm pc$ in diameter, whilst the $\rm H_2$ emission
traces shock-excited molecular gas in the interior $\sim 1~\rm kpc$ of the
circumnuclear disc. Hydrodynamical modelling shows that the apparent
discrepancy between the extent of the shocked gas and the radio emission can
occur when the brightest regions of the synchrotron-emitting plasma are
temporarily halted by dense clumps, whilst less bright plasma can percolate
through the porous ISM and form an energy-driven bubble that expands freely out
of the disc plane. This bubble is filled with low surface-brightness plasma not
visible in existing VLBI observations of 4C 31.04 due to insufficient
sensitivity. Additional radial flows of jet plasma may percolate to $\sim \rm

inputs are redundant, exhibiting behavior that has already been observed. Here,
we present an approach to increase the efficiency of fuzzers like AFL by
applying machine learning to directly model how programs behave. We learn a
forward prediction model that maps program inputs to execution traces, training
on the thousands of inputs collected during standard fuzzing. This learned
model guides exploration by focusing on fuzzing inputs on which our model is
the most uncertain (measured via the entropy of the predicted execution trace
distribution). By focusing on executing inputs our learned model is unsure
about, and ignoring any input whose behavior our model is certain about, we
show that we can significantly limit wasteful execution. Through testing our
approach on a set of binaries released as part of the DARPA Cyber Grand
Challenge, we show that our approach is able to find a set of inputs that
result in more code coverage and discovered crashes than baseline fuzzers with
significantly fewer executions.

representations of individual modalities that are maximally correlated. As a

maximal correlation becomes an appealing objective because of its operational
meaning and desirable properties. However, the strict whitening constraints
formalized in the HGR maximal correlation limit its application. To address
this problem, this paper proposes Soft-HGR, a novel framework to extract
informative features from multiple data modalities. Specifically, our framework
prevents the ""hard"" whitening constraints, while simultaneously preserving the
same feature geometry as in the HGR maximal correlation. The objective of
Soft-HGR is straightforward, only involving two inner products, which
guarantees the efficiency and stability in optimization. We further generalize
the framework to handle more than two modalities and missing modalities. When
labels are partially available, we enhance the discriminative power of the
feature representations by making a semi-supervised adaptation. Empirical
evaluation implies that our approach learns more informative feature mappings
and is more efficient to optimize.

In comparison, humans can recognize previously unseen objects by merely knowing
their semantic description. To mimic similar behaviour, zero-shot object
detection aims to recognize and localize 'unseen' object instances by using
only their semantic information. The model is first trained to learn the
relationships between visual and semantic domains for seen objects, later
transferring the acquired knowledge to totally unseen objects. This setting
gives rise to the need for correct alignment between visual and semantic
concepts, so that the unseen objects can be identified using only their
semantic attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function called
'Polarity loss', that promotes correct visual-semantic alignment for an
improved zero-shot object detection. On one hand, it refines the noisy semantic
embeddings via metric learning on a 'Semantic vocabulary' of related concepts
to establish a better synergy between visual and semantic domains. On the other
hand, it explicitly maximizes the gap between positive and negative predictions
to achieve better discrimination between seen, unseen and background objects.
Our approach is inspired by embodiment theories in cognitive science, that
claim human semantic understanding to be grounded in past experiences (seen
objects), related linguistic concepts (word vocabulary) and visual perception
(seen/unseen object images). We conduct extensive evaluations on MS-COCO and
Pascal VOC datasets, showing significant improvements over state of the art.

operate few qubits (currently, less than hundred), but are capable of executing
interesting computations. Above the quantum supremacy threshold (approx. 60
qubits), NISQ machines are expected to be more powerful than existing classical
computers. One of the most stringent problems is that computations (expressed
as quantum circuits) have to be adapted (compiled) to the NISQ hardware,
because the hardware does not support arbitrary interactions between the
qubits. This procedure introduces additional gates (e.g. SWAP gates) into the
circuits while leaving the implemented computations unchanged. Each additional
gate increases the failure rate of the adapted (compiled) circuits, because the
hardware and the circuits are not fault-tolerant. It is reasonable to expect
that the placement influences the number of additionally introduced gates.
Therefore, a combinatorial problem arises: how are circuit qubits allocated
(placed) initially to the hardware qubits? The novelty of this work relies on
the methodology used to investigate the influence of the initial placement. To
this end, we introduce a novel heuristic and cost model to estimate the number
of gates necessary to adapt a circuit to a given NISQ architecture. We
implement the heuristic (source code available on github) and benchmark it
using a standard compiler (e.g. from IBM Qiskit) treated as a black box.
Preliminary results indicate that cost reductions of up to 10\% can be achieved
for practical circuit instances on realistic NISQ architectures only by placing
qubits differently than default (trivial placement).

are typically emitting isotropically, the majority of ULXs with neutron star
accretors (NS ULXs) are found to be beamed. These findings confirm previous
assertions that a significant fraction of ULXs are hidden from view due to a
substantial misalignment of the emission beam and the line-of-sight. We find
the total number of NS ULXs in regions with constant star formation, solar
metallicity, and ages above ~1 Gyr to be higher than the BH ULXs, although
observationally both populations are comparable. For lower metallicities BH ULX
dominate both the total and observed ULX populations. As far as burst
star-formation is concerned, young ULX populations are dominated by BH ULXs,
but this changes as the population ages and, post star-formation, NS ULXs
dominate both the observed and total population of ULXs. We also compare our
simulation output to a previous analytical prediction for the relative ratio of
BH to NS ULXs in idealized flux-limited observations and find broad agreement
for all but the lowest metallicities. In so doing we find that in such surveys
the observed ULX population should be heavily dominated by black-hole systems

take the outputs of earlier layers as additional inputs to later layers.
Despite the extraordinary effectiveness of shortcuts, there remain open
questions on the mechanism and characteristics. For example, why are shortcuts
powerful? Why do shortcuts generalize well? In this paper, we investigate the
expressivity and generalizability of a novel sparse shortcut topology. First,
we demonstrate that this topology can empower a one-neuron-wide deep network to
approximate any univariate continuous function. Then, we present a novel
width-bounded universal approximator in contrast to depth-bounded universal
approximators and extend the approximation result to a family of equally
competent networks. Furthermore, with generalization bound theory, we show that
the proposed shortcut topology enjoys excellent generalizability. Finally, we
corroborate our theoretical analyses by comparing the proposed topology with
popular architectures, including ResNet and DenseNet, on well-known benchmarks
and perform a saliency map analysis to interpret the proposed topology. Our
work helps enhance the understanding of the role of shortcuts and suggests
further opportunities to innovate neural architectures.

confined ones without eruption, even for some X-class flares. How such large
flares occurred and why they are confined are still not well understood. Here
we studied a confined X2.2 flare in NOAA 12673 on 2017 September 6. It exhibits
two episodes of flare brightening with rather complex, atypical ribbons. Based
on topology analysis of extrapolated coronal magnetic field, we revealed that
there is a two-step magnetic reconnection process during the flare. Prior to
the flare, there is a magnetic flux rope (MFR) with one leg rooted in a
rotating sunspot. Neighboring to the leg is a magnetic null-point structure.
The sunspot drives the MFR to expand, pushing magnetic flux to the null point,
and reconnection is first triggered there. The disturbance from the null-point
reconnection triggers the second reconnection, i.e., a tether-cutting
reconnection below the rope. However, these two reconnections failed to produce
an eruption, because the rope is firmly held by its strapping flux.
Furthermore, we compared this flare with an eruptive X9.3 flare in the same
region with 2 hours later, which has a similar MFR configuration. The key
difference between them is that, for the confined flare, the MFR is fully below
the threshold of torus instability, while for the eruptive one, the MFR reaches
entirely above the threshold. This study provides a good evidence supporting
that reconnection alone may not be able to trigger eruption, rather, MHD
instability plays a more important role.

imperceptible perturbations to the images. These perturbed images are known as
`adversarial examples' and pose a serious threat to security and safety
critical systems. A litmus test for the strength of adversarial examples is
their transferability across different DNN models in a black box setting (i.e.
when the target model's architecture and parameters are not known to attacker).
Current attack algorithms that seek to enhance adversarial transferability work
on the decision level i.e. generate perturbations that alter the network
decisions. This leads to two key limitations: (a) An attack is dependent on the
task-specific loss function (e.g. softmax cross-entropy for object recognition)
and therefore does not generalize beyond its original task. (b) The adversarial
examples are specific to the network architecture and demonstrate poor
transferability to other network architectures. We propose a novel approach to
create adversarial examples that can broadly fool different networks on
multiple tasks. Our approach is based on the following intuition: ""Perpetual
metrics based on neural network features are highly generalizable and show
excellent performance in measuring and stabilizing input distortions. Therefore
an ideal attack that creates maximum distortions in the network feature space
should realize highly transferable examples"". We report extensive experiments

optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are inevitably affected by noise.
This paper proposes a new method named the multi-input fully-convolutional
networks (MIFCN) for denoising of OCT images. In contrast to recently proposed
natural image denoising CNNs, the proposed architecture allows the exploitation
of high degrees of correlation and complementary information among neighboring
OCT images through pixel by pixel fusion of multiple FCNs. The parameters of
the proposed multi-input architecture are learned by considering the
consistency between the overall output and the contribution of each input

denoising methods adopted on OCT images of normal and age-related macular
degeneration eyes in a quantitative and qualitative manner.

second derivative (Hessian) of action at choreographic three-body solutions

three-body solution is a periodic solution to equal mass planar three-body
problem under potential function $\sum_{i<j} U(r_{ij})$, in which three masses
chase each other on a single closed loop with equal time delay.
  We treat choreographic solutions that have the same symmetries as the
figure-eight, namely, symmetry for choreography, for time reversal, and for
time shift of half period. The function space of periodic functions are
decomposed into five subspaces by these symmetries. Namely, one subspace of
trivial oscillators with eigenvalue $4\pi^2/T^2\times k^2$, $k=0,1,2,\dots$,
four subspaces of choreographic functions, and four subspaces of
""zero-choreographic"" functions. Therefore, the matrix representation of the
Hessian is also decomposed into nine corresponding blocks. Explicit expressions
of base functions and the matrix representation of the Hessian for each
subspaces are given.
  The trivial eigenvalues with $k\ne 0$ are quadruply degenerated, while with
$k=0$ are doubly degenerated that correspond to the conservation of linear
momentum in $x$ and $y$ direction. The eigenvalues in choreographic subspace
have no degeneracy in general. In ""zero-choreographic"" subspace, every
eigenvalues are doubly degenerated.

times in the recent past. It is practically motivated by repetition and recency
effects in domains such as advertising (here consumer behavior may require
repeat actions by advertisers) and vocational training (here actions are
complex skills that can only be mastered with repetition to get a payoff).
Impairment can be naturally modelled as a temporal constraint on the strategy
space, and we provide two novel algorithms that achieve sublinear regret, each
working with different assumptions on the impairment effect. We introduce a new
notion called bucketing in our algorithm design, and show how it can
effectively address impairment as well as a broader class of temporal
constraints. Our regret bounds explicitly capture the cost of impairment and
show that it scales (sub-)linearly with the degree of impairment. Our work
complements recent work on modeling delays and corruptions, and we provide

polytope subject to further matroid constraints. This technique returns an
independent set in one matroid with limited violations of the other ones. On
top of the classical steps of iterative relaxation approaches, we iteratively
refine/split involved matroid constraints to obtain a more restrictive
constraint system, that is amenable to iterative relaxation techniques. Hence,
throughout the iterations, we both tighten constraints and later relax them by
dropping constrains under certain conditions. Due to the refinement step, we
can deal with considerably more general constraint classes than existing
iterative relaxation/rounding methods, which typically round on one matroid
polytope with additional simple cardinality constraints that do not overlap too
much.
  We show how our rounding method, combined with an application of a matroid
intersection algorithm, yields the first $2$-approximation for finding a
maximum-weight common independent set in $3$ matroids. Moreover, our
$2$-approximation is LP-based, and settles the integrality gap for the natural
relaxation of the problem. Prior to our work, no better upper bound than $3$
was known for the integrality gap, which followed from the greedy algorithm. We
also discuss various other applications of our techniques, including an
extension that allows us to handle a mixture of matroid and knapsack

central themes of topological data analysis, leading to many successful
applications. Many of the results in this area focus on global homological
features of a subset of a Euclidean space. In this case, homology recovery
predicates on imposing well understood geometric conditions on the underlying
set. Typically, these conditions guarantee that small enough neighborhoods of
the set have the same homology as the set itself. Existing work on recovering
local homological features of a space from samples employs similar conditions
locally. However, such local geometric conditions may vary from point to point
and can potentially degenerate. For instance, the size of local homology
preserving neighborhoods across all points of interest may not be bounded away
from zero. In this paper, we introduce more general and robust conditions for
local homology recovery and show that tame homology stratified sets, including
Whitney stratified sets, satisfy these conditions away from strata boundaries,
thus obtaining control over the regions where local homology recovery may not
be feasible. Moreover, we show that true local homology of such sets can be
computed from good enough samples using Vietoris-Rips complexes.

In this work, we firstly present a novel view of the working mechanism of the
diffusion process based on mathematical analysis, which reveals that the
diffusion process is actually computing the similarity of nodes with respect to
the seeds based on diffusion maps. Following this analysis, we propose super
diffusion, a novel inclusive learning-based framework for salient object
detection, which makes the optimum and robust performance by integrating a
large pool of feature spaces, scales and even features originally computed for
non-diffusion-based salient object detection. A closed-form solution of the
optimal parameters for the integration is determined through supervised
learning. At the local level, we propose to promote each individual diffusion
before the integration. Our mathematical analysis reveals the close
relationship between saliency diffusion and spectral clustering. Based on this,
we propose to re-synthesize each individual diffusion matrix from the most
discriminative eigenvectors and the constant eigenvector (for saliency
normalization). The proposed framework is implemented and experimented on
prevalently used benchmark datasets, consistently leading to state-of-the-art

adversarial perturbations. State of the art attacks can overcome most of the
defense or detection mechanisms suggested so far, and adversaries have the
upper hand in this arms race. Adversarial examples are designed to resemble the
normal input from which they were constructed, while triggering an incorrect
classification. This basic design goal leads to a characteristic spatial
behavior within the context of Activation Spaces, a term coined by the authors
to refer to the hyperspaces formed by the activation values of the network's
layers. Within the output of the first layers of the network, an adversarial
example is likely to resemble normal instances of the source class, while in
the final layers such examples will diverge towards the adversary's target
class. The steps below enable us to leverage this inherent shift from one class
to another in order to form a novel adversarial example detector. We construct
Euclidian spaces out of the activation values of each of the deep neural
network layers. Then, we induce a set of k-nearest neighbor classifiers (k-NN),
one per activation space of each neural network layer, using the
non-adversarial examples. We leverage those classifiers to produce a sequence
of class labels for each nonperturbed input sample and estimate the a priori
probability for a class label change between one activation space and another.
During the detection phase we compute a sequence of classification labels for
each input using the trained classifiers. We then estimate the likelihood of
those classification sequences and show that adversarial sequences are far less
likely than normal ones. We evaluated our detection method against the state of
the art C&W attack method, using two image classification datasets (MNIST,
CIFAR-10) reaching an AUC 0f 0.95 for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

streaks arise from a preferential amplification of upstream counter-rotating
vortical perturbations with a specific spanwise wavelength. These streaks are
associated with heat flux striations at the wall near flow reattachment and
they can trigger transition to turbulence. The streak wavelength predicted by
our analysis compares favorably with observations from two different hypersonic
compression ramp experiments. Furthermore, our analysis of inviscid transport
equations demonstrates that base flow deceleration contributes to the
amplification of streamwise velocity and that the baroclinic effects are
responsible for the production of streamwise vorticity. Finally, the appearance
of the temperature streaks near reattachment is triggered by the growth of
streamwise velocity and streamwise vorticity perturbations as well as by the
amplification of upstream temperature perturbations by the reattachment shock.

Based on this fact, we also propose some new neural network models, where at
each layer the input is first projected onto a low-dimensional subspace by a
random projection and then the standard linear connection and non-linear

arbitrary qudit gates. Using orbital angular momentum states as a qudit, the
simplest implementation of the $X_d$ gate in $d$ dimensions requires a single
quantum sorter $S_d$ and two spiral phase plates. We then extend this
construction to a generalised $X_d(p)$ gate to perform a cyclic permutation of
a set of $d$, equally spaced values $\{ \ket{\ell_0}, \ket{\ell_0+p},\ldots,
\ket{\ell_0+(d-1)p} \} \mapsto \{ \ket{\ell_0+p}, \ket {\ell_0+2p},\ldots,

Mach-Zehnder configurations (two sorters $S_d$, two spiral phase plates).
Remarkably, the number of spiral phase plates is independent of the qudit
dimension $d$. Our architecture for $X_d$ and generalised $X_d(p)$ gate will

non-tumor. Subsequently, local maxima were used as seed points for volume
growing in patients receiving NAC (N=10). The percentage of tumor volume change
was evaluated against semi-automatic segmentations. The primary cancer was
localized in 95% of the tumors at the cost of 0.9 false positive per patient.
False positives included focally enhancing regions of unknown origin and parts
of the intramammary blood vessels. Volume growing from the seed points showed a
median tumor volume decrease of 70% (interquartile range: 50%-77%), comparable
to the semi-automatic segmentations (median: 70%, interquartile range 23%-76%).

Inside the inner heliosheath, the charge-exchange interaction of this gas with
the shocked solar wind and pickup ions creates energetic neutral atoms (ENAs).
ISN H is strongly depleted inside the termination shock but a fraction reaches
the Earth's orbit. In these regions of the heliosphere, ISN H is the source
population for interstellar pickup ions and for the heliospheric backscatter
glow. The Globally Distributed Flux (GDF) of ENAs created in the inner
heliosheath has been sampled directly by Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX).
Based on these measurements, we calculate the density of the GDF ENA population
at the Earth's orbit. We find that this number density is between $10^{-4}$ and
$10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, i.e., comparable in magnitude to the number density of ISN
H in the downwind portion of the Earth's orbit. Half of this atom population
have energies less than $\sim 80$ eV. This GDF population of neutral hydrogen
is likely to provide a significant contribution to the intensity of
heliospheric glow in the downwind hemisphere, may be the source of the inner
source of hydrogen pickup ions, and may be responsible for the excess of
production of pickup ions found in the analysis of magnetic wave events induced
by the proton pickup process in the downwind region at 1 au from the Sun.

computer model of effect is based on the assumption about the displacement of
magnetic particles inside the elastic matrix under the external magnetic field
and the formation of chain-like structures. Such displacement of metallic
particles between the planes of capacitor leads to the change of capacity,
which can be considered as a change of effective permittivity of elastomer
caused by magnetic field (magnetodielectric effect). In the literature mainly
2D approach was used to model similar effect. In this paper we present the new
approach of magnetorheological elastomers simulation - 3D-model of
magnetodielectric effect with ability to simulate systems of around 100000
particles. Within the framework of the model three types of particle size
distributions were simulated which gives an advantage over previously reported
approaches. Lognormal size distribution was shown to give better qualitative
match of the modeling and experimental results than monosized type. The
developed model resulted in perfect qualitative agreement with all experimental
data obtained earlier for Fe-based elastomers. The proposed model is useful to

be attributed to the chiral ordering of spin structure (i.e., skyrmion-like) in
the single SrRuO3 layer without contacting 5d oxide SrIrO3 layer. It is
revealed that the RuO6 octahedral tilting induced by local
orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition exists across the
SrRuO3/SrTiO3 interface, which naturally breaks the inversion symmetry. Our
theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)

interaction of 4d SrRuO3. This DM interaction can stabilize the N\'eel-type
magnetic skyrmions, which in turn accounts for the observed THE in transport.
The RuO6 octahedral tilting-induced DM interaction provides a pathway toward

heavy-ion storage rings for measuring masses of very short-lived exotic nuclei.
The IMS is based on the isochronous setting of the ring. One of the main
parameters of this setting is the transition energy $\gamma_{t}$. %The
transition energy $\gamma_{t}$ plays an important role in the isochronous mass
spectrometry (IMS). It has been a challenge to determine the $\gamma_{t}$ and
especially to monitor the variation of $\gamma_{t}$ during experiments. In this
paper we introduce a method to measure the $\gamma_{t}$ online during IMS
experiments by using the acquired experimental data. Furthermore, since the
storage ring has (in our context) a relatively large momentum acceptance, the
variation of the $\gamma_{t}$ across the ring acceptance is a source of
systematic uncertainty of measured masses. With the installation of two
time-of-flight (TOF) detectors, the velocity of each stored ion and its
revolution time are simultaneously available for the analysis. These quantities
enabled us to determine the $\gamma_{t}$ as a function of orbital length in the
ring. The presented method is especially important for future IMS experiments
planned at the new-generation storage ring facilities FAIR in Germany and HIAF
in China.

the hot WHIM is hard to detect due to its high ionisation level, the warm
(T$\lesssim10^{5.5}$ K) phase of the WHIM has been very robustly detected in
the FUV band. We adopted the assumption that the hot and warm WHIM phases are
co-located and thus used the FUV-detected warm WHIM as a tracer for the
cosmologically interesting hot WHIM. We utilised the assumption by performing
an X-ray follow-up in the sight line of a blazar PKS 2155-304 at the redshifts
where previous FUV measurements of OVI, SiIV and BLA absorption have indicated
the existence of the warm WHIM. We looked for the OVII He$\alpha$ and OVIII
Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, the most likely hot WHIM tracers. Despite of the
very large exposure time ($\approx$ 1 Ms), the XMM-Newton/RGS1 data yielded no
significant detection which corresponds to upper limits of $\log{N({\rm
OVII})({\rm cm}^{-2}))} \le 14.5-15.2$ and $\log{N({\rm OVIII})({\rm
cm}^{-2}))} \le 14.9-15.2$. An analysis of LETG/HRC data yielded consistent
results. However, the LETG/ACIS data yielded a detection of an absorption line
- like feature at $\lambda \approx$ 20 \AA\ at simple one parameter uncertainty
- based confidence level of 3.7 $\sigma$, consistently with several earlier
LETG/ACIS reports. Given the high statistical quality of the RGS1 data, the
possibility of RGS1 accidentally missing the true line at $\lambda \sim$ 20
\AA\ is very low, 0.006%. Neglecting this, the LETG/ACIS detection can be
interpreted as Ly$\alpha$ transition of OVIII at one of the redshifts
(z$\approx$ 0.054) of FUV-detected warm WHIM. Given the very convincing X-ray
spectral evidence for and against the existence of the $\lambda \sim$ 20 \AA\

Voting spaces as pairwise registration estimators and show how they can be

efficiently optimized. The feature-based nature of our registration framework
allows to register images with a-priori unknown translational and rotational
relations, and is also able to handle scale changes of up to 30% in our test

proposed method over existing pairwise and groupwise registration methods is
demonstrated on eight highly challenging sets of historical images with

onset of disease, cancer in particular, is no different. Multi-stage models
provide a simple but very general mathematical framework for studying the
failure of complex systems, or equivalently, the onset of disease. They include
the Armitage Doll multi-stage cancer model as a particular case, and have
potential to provide new insights into how failures and disease, arise and
progress. A method described by E.T. Jaynes is developed to provide an
analytical solution for a large class of these models, and highlights
connections between the convolution of Laplace transforms, sums of random
variables, and Schwinger/Feynman parameterisations. Examples include: exact
solutions to the Armitage-Doll model, the sum of Gamma-distributed variables
with integer-valued shape parameters, a clonal-growth cancer model, and a model
for cascading disasters. Applications and limitations of the approach are
discussed in the context of recent cancer research. The model is sufficiently
general to be used in many contexts, such as engineering, project management,
disease progression, and disaster risk for example, allowing the estimation of
failure rates in complex systems and projects. The intended result is a
mathematical toolkit for applying multi-stage models to the study of failure
rates in complex systems and to the onset of disease, cancer in particular.

important constraints on their origin in regions of star formation. In
particular, the abundances of deuterated species are very sensitive to the
physical conditions in the environment where they form. Due to the low
temperatures in regions of star formation, these isotopologues are enhanced to
significant levels, making detections of multiply-deuterated species possible.
However, for complex organic species, only the multiply-deuterated variants of
methanol and methyl cyanide have been reported so far. The aim of this paper is
to initiate the characterisation of multiply-deuterated variants of complex
organic species with the first detection of doubly-deuterated methyl formate,
CHD2OCHO. We use ALMA observations from the Protostellar Interferometric Line
Survey (PILS) of the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, in the spectral range
of 329.1 GHz to 362.9 GHz. We report the first detection of doubly-deuterated
methyl formate CHD2OCHO in the ISM. The D/H ratio of CHD2OCHO is found to be
2-3 times higher than the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO for both sources, similar to
the results for formaldehyde from the same dataset. The observations are
compared to a gas-grain chemical network coupled to a dynamical physical model,
tracing the evolution of a molecular cloud until the end of the Class 0
protostellar stage. The overall D/H ratio enhancements found in the
observations are of the same order of magnitude as the predictions from the
model for the early stages of Class 0 protostars. However, the higher D/H ratio
of CHD2OCHO compared to the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO is still not predicted by the
model. This suggests that a mechanism is enhancing the D/H ratio of singly- and
doubly-deuterated methyl formate that is not in the model, e.g. mechanisms for
H-D substitutions.

a major public health issue. Pressure ulcers appear following excessive
compression of buttock's soft tissues by bony structures, and particularly in
ischial and sacral bones. Current prevention techniques are mainly based on
daily skin inspection to spot red patches or injuries. Nevertheless, most
pressure ulcers occur internally and are difficult to detect early. Estimating
internal strains within soft tissues could help to evaluate the risk of
pressure ulcer. A subject-specific biomechanical model could be used to assess
internal strains from measured skin surface pressures. However, a realistic 3D
non-linear Finite Element buttock model, with different layers of tissue
materials for skin, fat and muscles, requires somewhere between minutes and
hours to compute, therefore forbidding its use in a real-time daily prevention
context. In this article, we propose to optimize these computations by using a
reduced order modeling technique (ROM) based on proper orthogonal
decompositions of the pressure and strain fields coupled with a machine
learning method. ROM allows strains to be evaluated inside the model
interactively (i.e. in less than a second) for any pressure field measured
below the buttocks. In our case, with only 19 modes of variation of pressure
patterns, an error divergence of one percent is observed compared to the full
scale simulation for evaluating the strain field. This reduced model could
therefore be the first step towards interactive pressure ulcer prevention in a
daily setup. Highlights-Buttocks biomechanical modelling,-Reduced order

technique improves image quality and reduces dose but can also be the source of
discomfort and sometimes pain for the patient. Therefore, alternative
techniques allowing reduced breast compression is of potential interest. The
aim of this work is to develop a 3D biomechanical Finite Element (FE) breast
model in order to analyze various breast compression strategies and their
impact on image quality and radiation dose. Large breast deformations are
simulated using this FE model with ANSYS software. A particular attention is
granted to the computation of the residual stress in the model due to gravity
and boundary conditions (thorax anatomy, position of the patient inside the MRI
machine). Previously developed biomechanical breast models use a simplified
breast anatomy by modeling adipose and fibroglandular tissues only (Rajagopal
et al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev: Syst Biol Med 2:293--304, 2010). However,
breast reconstruction surgery has proven the importance of suspensory ligaments
and breast fasciae on breast mechanics (Lockwood in Plast Reconstr Surg
103:1411--1420, 1999). We are therefore consider using a more realistic breast
anatomy by including skin, muscles, and suspensory ligaments. The breast
tissues are modeled as neo-Hookean materials. A physical correct modeling of
the breast requires the knowledge of the stress-free breast configuration.
Here, this undeformed shape (i.e., without any residual stress) is computed
using the prediction--correction iterative scheme proposed by Eiben et al. (Ann
of Biomed Eng 44:154--173, 2016). The unloading procedure uses the breast
configuration in prone and supine position in order to find a unique
displacement vector field induced by gravitational forces. The 3D breast
geometry is reconstructed from MRI images that are segmented (Yushkevich et al.
in Neuroimage 31:1116--1128, 2006) to differentiate the four main tissue types.
The breast volume is discretized with a hexa-dominant FE meshing tool as a
unique volume. Finally, the model is evaluated by comparing the estimated
breast deformations under gravity load with the experimental ones measured in
three body positions: prone, supine, and oblique supine.

  interfaces",,,"10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c00985",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Controlling the anchoring of liquid crystal molecules at an interface with a
water solution influences the entire organization of the underlying liquid
crystal phase, which is crucial for many applications. The simplest way to
stabilize such interfaces is by fabricating droplets of liquid crystal in
water; however, a greater sensitivity to interfacial effects can be achieved
using liquid crystal shells, i.e. spherical films of liquid crystal suspended
in water. Anchoring transitions on those systems are traditionally triggered by
the adsorption of surfactant molecules onto the interface, which is neither an
instantaneous nor a reversible process. In this study, we report the ability to
change the anchoring of 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB), one of the most widely
used liquid crystals, at the interface with dilute water solutions of polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA), a polymer commonly used for stabilizing liquid crystal shells,
simply by controlling the temperature in the close vicinity of the liquid
crystal clearing point. A quasi-static increase in temperature triggers an
instantaneous reorientation of the molecules from parallel to perpendicular to
the interfaces, owing to the local disordering effect of PVA on 5CB, prior to
the phase transition of the bulk 5CB. We study this anchoring transition on
both flat suspended films and spherical shells of liquid crystals. Switching
anchoring entails a series of structural transformations involving the
formation of transient structures in which topological defects are stabilized.
The type of defect structure depends on the topology of the film. This method
has the ability to influence both interfaces of the film nearly at the same
time, and can be applied to transform an initially polydisperse group of
nematic shells into a monodisperse population of bivalent shells.

fundamental for many applications. For example in a bipartite graph
representing user-website visiting activities, user cardinalities (the number
of distinct visited websites) are monitored to report network anomalies. These
real-world graph streams may contain user-item duplicates and have a huge
number of distinct user-item pairs, therefore, it is infeasible to exactly
compute user cardinalities when memory and computation resources are
limited.Existing methods are designed to approximately estimate user
cardinalities, whose accuracy highly depends on parameters that are not easy to
set. Moreover, these methods cannot provide anytime-available estimation, as
the user cardinalities are computed at the end of the data stream. Real-time
applications such as anomaly detection require that user cardinalities are
estimated on the fly. To address these problems, we develop novel bit and
register sharing algorithms, which use a bit array and a register array to
build a compact sketch of all users' connected items respectively. Compared
with previous bit and register sharing methods, our algorithms exploit the
dynamic properties of the bit and register arrays (e.g., the fraction of zero
bits in the bit array at each time) to significantly improve the estimation
accuracy, and have low time complexity (O(1)) to update the estimations each
time they observe a new user-item pair. In addition, our algorithms are simple

performance of our methods on real-world datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that our methods are several times more accurate and faster than

Automating real-time behavior recognition while ensuring actions classification

surrounding drivers, the unique traits of individuals, and the computational
constraints imposed by in-vehicle embedded platforms. Prior work fails to
jointly meet these runtime/accuracy requirements and mostly rely on a single
sensing modality, which in turn can be a single point of failure. In this
paper, we harness the exceptional feature extraction abilities of deep learning
and propose a dedicated Interwoven Deep Convolutional Neural Network (InterCNN)
architecture to tackle the problem of accurate classification of driver
behaviors in real-time. The proposed solution exploits information from
multi-stream inputs, i.e., in-vehicle cameras with different fields of view and
optical flows computed based on recorded images, and merges through multiple
fusion layers abstract features that it extracts. This builds a tight
ensembling system, which significantly improves the robustness of the model. In
addition, we introduce a temporal voting scheme based on historical inference
instances, to enhance the classification accuracy. Experiments conducted with a
dataset that we collect in a mock-up car environment demonstrate that the
proposed InterCNN with MobileNet convolutional blocks can classify 9 different
behaviors with 73.97% accuracy, and 5 'aggregated' behaviors with 81.66%
accuracy. We further show that our architecture is highly computationally
efficient, as it performs inferences within 15ms, which satisfies the real-time

of this work is to develop simulation tools enabling the characterization of

The resulting compressed breast model is integrated in an image simulation

Fast modelling of the high-redshift 21cm signal will be crucial for efficiently
comparing these data sets with theory. The most detailed theoretical
predictions currently come from numerical simulations and from faster but less
accurate semi-numerical simulations. Recently, machine learning techniques have
been proposed to emulate the behaviour of these semi-numerical simulations with
drastically reduced time and computing cost. We compare the viability of five
such machine learning techniques for emulating the 21cm power spectrum of the
publicly-available code SimFast21. Our best emulator is a multilayer perceptron
with three hidden layers, reproducing SimFast21 power spectra $10^8$ times
faster than the simulation with 4% mean squared error averaged across all
redshifts and input parameters. The other techniques (interpolation, Gaussian
processes regression, and support vector machine) have slower prediction times
and worse prediction accuracy than the multilayer perceptron. All our emulators
can make predictions at any redshift and scale, which gives more flexible
predictions but results in significantly worse prediction accuracy at lower
redshifts. We then present a proof-of-concept technique for mapping between two
different simulations, exploiting our best emulator's fast prediction speed. We
demonstrate this technique to find a mapping between SimFast21 and another
publicly-available code 21cmFAST. We observe a noticeable offset between the
simulations for some regions of the input space. Such techniques could
potentially be used as a bridge between fast semi-numerical simulations and
accurate numerical radiative transfer simulations.

recoverable code, i.e., a locally recoverable code archiving the Singleton-type
bound, can have length much bigger than $q+1$. This is quite different from the
classical $q$-ary MDS codes where it is conjectured that the code length is
upper bounded by $q+1$ (or $q+2$ for some special case). This discovery
inspired some recent studies on length of an optimal locally recoverable code.
It was shown in \cite{LXY} that a $q$-ary optimal locally recoverable code is
unbounded for $d=3,4$. Soon after, it was proved that a $q$-ary optimal locally
recoverable code with distance $d$ and locality $r$ can have length
$\Omega_{d,r}(q^{1 + 1/\lfloor(d-3)/2\rfloor})$. Recently, an explicit
construction of $q$-ary optimal locally recoverable codes for distance $d=5,6$
was given in \cite{J18} and \cite{BCGLP}.
  In this paper, we further investigate construction optimal locally
recoverable codes along the line of using parity-check matrices. Inspired by
classical Reed-Solomon codes and \cite{J18}, we equip parity-check matrices
with the Vandermond structure. It is turns out that a parity-check matrix with
the Vandermond structure produces an optimal locally recoverable code must obey
certain disjoint property for subsets of $\mathbb{F}_q$. To our surprise, this
disjoint condition is equivalent to a well-studied problem in extremal graph
theory. With the help of extremal graph theory, we succeed to improve all of
the best known results in \cite{GXY} for $d\geq 7$. In addition, for $d=6$, we
are able to remove the constraint required in \cite{J18} that $q$ is even.

maximum dimensionless spin of 0.998, and predicts a disc inclination in
agreement with that of the binary. Our preferred models have moderate Fe

that even if scalar curvature fluctuations have a subdominant non-Gaussian
component, these non-Gaussian perturbations can source a dominant portion of
the induced GWs. Moreover, the GWs sourced by non-Gaussian scalar fluctuations
peaks at a higher frequency and this can result in distinctive observational
signatures. We found that the sensitive next-generation-interferometers, which

bounds on $f_{\rm NL}$ depending on the amplitude and the width of the GW

Waals interactions, we consider the energetics of adsorbed water at anatase
surfaces in pristine and copper doped systems. Simulation results indicate that
copper dopant at anatase (101) surfaces is most stable in a 2+ oxidation state
and a disperse configuration, suggesting the formation of secondary CuO phases
is energetically unfavourable. In agreement with previous reports, water at the
studied surface is predicted to exhibit molecular adsorption with this tendency
slightly enhanced by copper. Results imply that the enhancement of
photoactivity at anatase surfaces through Cu doping is more likely to arise
from electronic interactions mediated by charge transfer and inter-bandgap
states increasing photoexcitation and extending surface-hole lifetimes rather

curves (continuous arcs in the plane) is the graph whose vertices correspond to
the curves and in which two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if the
corresponding curves are disjoint. A curve is called {\em $x$-monotone} if
every vertical line intersects it in at most one point. An $x$-monotone curve
is {\em grounded} if its left endpoint lies on the $y$-axis.
  We prove that if $G$ is the disjointness graph of a family of grounded
$x$-monotone curves such that $\omega(G)=k$, then $\chi(G)\leq \binom{k+1}{2}$.
If we only require that every curve is $x$-monotone and intersects the

problems are identified in order to achieve a concrete step forward. 1. CONTEXT
AND PROBLEMATICS Through studies on ICT solutions for energy control of
buildings, a 3-layers model is proposed to integrate these solutions and
position a new way for energy efficiency. The building sector is the largest
user of energy and CO 2 emitter in the EU, estimated at approximately 40% of
the total consumption (Sharples et al., 1999). According to the International
Panel on Climate Change (European Union, 2010), 30% of energy used in buildings
could be reduced with net economic benefits by 2030. Such a reduction, however,
is meaningless unless ""sustainability"" is considered. Because of these factors,
healthy, sustainable, and energy efficient buildings have become active topics
in international research; there is an urgent need for a new kind of
high-technology driven and integrative research that should lead to the massive
development of smart buildings and, in the medium term, smart cities. From a
building lifecycle perspective, most of the energy (~80%) is consumed during
the operational stage of the building (European Union, 2010) (Bilsen et al.,
2013). Reducing building energy consumption may be addressed by the physical
modifications which can be operated on a building like upgrading windows,
heating systems or modifying thermic characteristics by insulating. Another
possible path to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to use
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to the
International Panel on Climate Change, a reduction of energy even greater than
the 30% can be targeted by 2030 by considering ICT solutions. In support of
this claim, some specialists believe that ICT-based solutions have the
potential to enable 50-80% greenhouse gas reduction globally. In this respect,
ICT innovation opens prospects for the development of a new range of new
services highly available, flexible, safe, easy to integrate, and user friendly
(Bilsen et al., 2013). This, in turn, should foster a sophisticated, reliable
and fast communication infrastructure for the connection of various distributed
elements (sensors, generators, substations...) that enables to exchange
real-time data, information and knowledge needed to improve efficiency (e.g.,
to monitor and control energy consumption), reliability (e.g., to facilitate
maintenance operations), flexibility (e.g., to integrate new rules to meet new
consumer expectations), and investment returns, but also to induce a shift in
consumer behaviour.

Additionally, we obtain corresponding hardness results for the case that the

Furthermore, we show that checking for injections (resp. surjections) between
persistence modules is NP-hard. In conjunction with earlier results from
computational algebra this gives a complete characterization of the
computational complexity of one-sided stability. Lastly, we show that it is in
general NP-hard to approximate distances induced by noise systems within a

anticipation-capable organism increases its long-term fitness over an organism
that oscillates in-sync with the environment, provided $\theta$ does not exceed

For a sub-optimal ensemble of anticipators, anticipation performs better to
bet-hedging only when the variance in anticipation is small compared to the
mean and the rate of pre-emptive transition is high. Taken together, our work
suggests that anticipation increases overall fitness of an organism in a
periodic environment and it is a viable alternative to bet-hedging provided the

probability of another off-axis coincident detection during the third

up to 10 yr$^{-1}$ by the upgraded advanced LIGO configuration A+. We show that

of correlated quantum sources, the classical case of which is covered by the
celebrated Slepian-Wolf theorem. We focus specifically on classical-quantum
(cq) sources, for which one edge of the rate region, corresponding to the
compression of the classical part, using the quantum part as side information
at the decoder, was previously determined by Devetak and Winter [Phys. Rev. A
68, 042301 (2003)]. Whereas the Devetak-Winter protocol attains a rate-sum
equal to the von Neumann entropy of the joint source, here we show that the
full rate region is much more complex, due to the partially quantum nature of
the source. In particular, in the opposite case of compressing the quantum part
of the source, using the classical part as side information at the decoder,
typically the rate sum is strictly larger than the von Neumann entropy of the
total source.
  We determine the full rate region in the generic case, showing that, apart
from the Devetak-Winter point, all other points in the achievable region have a
rate sum strictly larger than the joint entropy. We can interpret the
difference as the price paid for the quantum encoder being ignorant of the
classical side information. In the general case, we give an achievable rate
region, via protocols that are built on the decoupling principle, and the
principles of quantum state merging and quantum state redistribution. Our
achievable region is matched almost by a single-letter converse, which however
still involves asymptotic errors and an unbounded auxiliary system.

systems. They occur in biological models because of diffusion effects or as
simplifying modeling elements. We propose here to consider delayed stochastic
reaction networks. The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of
a delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis
more involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic
time-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be
exactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any
delay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the
addition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of
stochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution
arbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,
therefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.
In particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction
networks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if
the non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more
difficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results
tell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their
distribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.
We also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the
moment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared
to the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed
stochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is
considered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that
the delay-free network satisfy the conditions of ergodicity and
output-controllability.

languages (e.g., C and C++) remain a prominent threat against computer systems.
The prevalence of techniques like return-oriented programming (ROP) in
attacking real-world systems has prompted major processor manufacturers to
design hardware-based countermeasures against specific classes of run-time
attacks. An example is the recently added support for pointer authentication
(PA) in the ARMv8-A processor architecture, commonly used in devices like
smartphones. PA is a low-cost technique to authenticate pointers so as to
resist memory vulnerabilities. It has been shown to enable practical protection
against memory vulnerabilities that corrupt return addresses or function
pointers. However, so far, PA has received very little attention as a general
purpose protection mechanism to harden software against various classes of
memory attacks. In this paper, we use PA to build novel defenses against
various classes of run-time attacks, including the first PA-based mechanism for
data pointer integrity. We present PARTS, an instrumentation framework that
integrates our PA-based defenses into the LLVM compiler and the GNU/Linux
operating system and show, via systematic evaluation, that PARTS provides
better protection than current solutions at a reasonable performance overhead

proportional to the function that describes ideal jump motion in the absence of
vibrations. The amplitude of the tail is unity in idealized jump dynamics
models, but is reduced from unity by the intra-well motion. Analytical
estimates of the amplitude of the jump motion signature are provided by
assuming a \textcolor{blue}{factorization of the conditional probability
density of the particle position at long times, motivated by the separation of
time scales associated with inter-cell and intra-cell motion}. The assumption
leads to a factorization of the ISF at long correlation times, where one factor
is an ideal jump motion signature, and the other component is the amplitude of
the signature. The amplitude takes the form of a single-particle anharmonic
Debye-Waller factor. The factorization approximation is exact at the
diffraction conditions associated with the periodic potential. Numerical

available analytical models are limited to the analysis of single wires or
infinite arrays that, in general, do not represent real devices in real
applications. The numerical models based on finite element method using the H
formulation of the Maxwells equations are useful for the analysis of
medium-size systems, but their application in large-scale systems is
problematic due to the excessive computational cost in terms of memory and
computation time. Then it is necessary to devise new strategies to make the
computation more efficient. The homogenization and the multi-scale methods have
successfully simplified the description of the systems allowing the study of
large-scale systems. Also, efficient calculations have been achieved using the

local $U(1)$ gauge group in order to accommodate a stable (fermionic) Dark
Matter (DM) candidate. We have focussed on parameter regions where DM possesses
adequate self interaction, owing to the presence of a light scalar mediator
(the dark Higgs), alleviating some of the tensions in the small-scale
structures. We have studied the scenario in the light of a variety of data,
mostly from dark matter direct searches, collider searches and flavour physics
experiments, with an attempt to constrain the interactions of the standard
model (SM) particles with the ones in the Dark Sector (DS). Assuming a small
gauge kinetic mixing parameter, we find that for rather heavy DM %$\gtrsim
\mathcal{O}(1-10)\,\, {\rm GeV}$%, the most stringent bound on the mixing angle
of the Dark Higgs with the SM Higgs boson comes from dark matter direct
detection experiments, while for lighter DM, LHC constraints become more
relevant. Note that, due to the presence of very light mediators the usual
realisation of direct detection constraints in terms of momentum independent
cross sections had to be reevaluated for our scenario. In addition, we find
that the smallness of the relevant portal couplings, as dictated by data,
critically suppress the viability of DM production by the standard ""freeze-out""
mechanism in such simplified scenarios. In particular, the viable DM masses are
$\lesssim \mathcal{O}(2)$ GeV $i.e.$ in the regions where direct detection
limits tend to become weak. For heavier DM with large self-interactions, we
hence conclude that non-thermal production mechanisms are favoured. Lastly,
future collider reach of such a simplified scenario has also been studied in
detail.

measure galaxy clustering in redshift space. We focus our attention on two of
the most representative and popular families of modified gravity models: the Hu
\& Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity and the normal branch of the DGP model. The galaxy
catalogues are built using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescription
with the HOD parameters in the modified gravity models tuned to match with the
number density and the real-space clustering of {\sc boss-cmass} galaxies. We
employ two approaches to model RSD: the first is based on linear perturbation
theory and the second models non-linear effects on small-scales by assuming
standard gravity and including biasing and RSD effects. We measure the monopole
to real-space correlation function ratio, the quadrupole to monopole ratio,
clustering wedges and multipoles of the correlation function and use these
statistics to find the constraints on the distortion parameter, $\beta$. We
find that the linear model fails to reproduce the N-body simulation results and
the true value of $\beta$ on scales $s < 40\Mpch$, while the non-linear
modelling of RSD recovers the value of $\beta$ on the scales of interest for
all models. RSD on large scales ($s\gtrsim20$-$40\Mpch$) have been found to
show significant deviations from the prediction of standard gravity in the DGP

promising, due to the different screening mechanism in this model.

the core density as known for the Earth and using a convection principle for
the iron-rich core. Convection minimizes both the density and temperature
gradients inside the core fluid. This is achieved if the density of the core
fluid is close to pure iron melting density at the core-mantle boundary, and
the density has the smallest value possible for iron-rich melt at the inner
core boundary. The critical iron densities for both pure iron and iron with
maximal light impurities were previously obtained utilizing Landau's theory of
first order phase transitions with the most reliable experimental scaling. The
planetary interior density is found by iteratively calculating the gravity and
pressure in small radial steps. Moment of inertia factors are also calculated
and agree well for the bodies for which we have accurate measurements: Moon,
Mars and Mercury. Calculations are also made for the exoplanets Kepler-78b,
K2-229b and Kepler-10b. All show iron-rich liquid in their cores. The lighter,
solar objects are without an inner core, but the heaviest two exoplanets have a
pure iron innermost core inside the inner core. The parameter range for a
growing inner core in the radius-mass plane is calculated. The magnetic field
following the growth of an inner core protects life on Earth, and similarly for
exoplanets. This guides the selection of exoplanets to study in the search for
life.

intensity $J_W$ which decreases algebraically with the size of the system

simulation of an isolated Milky Way-type galaxy to show that the phase-space
spirals develop naturally from vertical oscillations driven by the buckling of
the stellar bar. We claim that the physical mechanism standing behind the
observed incomplete phase-space mixing process can be internal and not
necessarily due to the perturbation induced by a massive satellite. In our
model, the bending oscillations propagate outwards and produce axisymmetric
variations of the mean vertical coordinate and of the vertical velocity
component. As a consequence, the phase-space wrapping results in the formation
of patterns with various morphology across the disk, depending on the bar
orientation, distance to the galactic center and time elapsed since the bar
buckling. Once bending waves appear, they are supported for a long time via
disk self-gravity. The underlying physical mechanism implies the link between
in-plane and vertical motion that leads directly to phase-space structures
whose amplitude and shape are in remarkable agreement with those of the
phase-space spirals observed in the Milky Way disk. In our isolated galaxy
simulation, phase-space spirals are still distinguishable, at the solar
neighbourhood, 3 Gyr after the buckling phase. The long-lived character of the
phase-space spirals generated by the bar buckling instability cast doubts on
the timing argument used so far to get back at the time of the onset of the
perturbation: phase-space spirals may have been caused by perturbations
originated several Gyrs ago, and not as recent as suggested so far.

The combination of sensitive observations in the GeV domain by AGILE and {\em
Fermi}-LAT and increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations have recently
brought new insights into our understanding of the pulsed emission and particle
acceleration processes in pulsars. Particle-in-cell simulations of pulsar
magnetospheres show that the equatorial current sheet forming beyond the light
cylinder is the main culprit for magnetic dissipation, particle acceleration
and bright high-energy synchrotron radiation all together. The shinning current
sheet naturally results in a pulse of light each time the sheet crosses our
line of sight, which happens twice in most cases. Synthetic lightcurves present
robust features reminiscent of observed gamma-ray pulsars by the {\em
Fermi}-LAT and AGILE, opening up new perspectives for direct comparison between
simulations and observations.

access to a source sequence and stores the position of a certain number of
strings in a posting table. When a user inquires the position of a string, the
retrieval system, instead of searching in the source sequence directly, relies
on the the posting table to answer the query more efficiently. In this paper,
the Statistical DSM problem is a proposed as a statistical and
information-theoretic formulation of the classic DSM problem in which both the
source and the query have a statistical description while the strings stored in
the posting sequence are described as a code. Through this formulation, we are
able to define the efficiency of the retrieval system as the average cost in
answering a users' query in the limit of sufficiently long source sequence.
This formulation is used to study the retrieval performance for the case in
which (i) all the strings of a given length, referred to as k-grams , and (ii)
prefix-free codes.

be caused by the prolonged rapid spin-up of the pulsar causing a sudden
transfer of angular momentum between the superfluid and non-superfluid
components of the star. We find no evidence for profile or spectral changes at
the epochs of the glitches, supporting the conclusion that these are due to the
same process as in normal pulsar glitches, but in reverse.

the metric derivative terms can significantly modify inflationary predictions.
We specialise to Higgs inflation and terms of only up to dimension 4.
Transforming to the Einstein frame, we show that by tuning the coefficients of
the new terms, we can generate various effective inflationary potentials,
including quadratic, hilltop-type, $\alpha$-attractor and inflection point.
Some of these can give inflation in agreement with observations, including with
a large tensor-to-scalar ratio, even if the non-minimal coupling is zero.

prediction of weather, hydrology, and carbon dioxide concentration. In
numerical modelling of turbulent fluxes, a -7/3 power-law scaling in turbulence
cospectra is usually assumed at high wavenumbers. In eddy-covariance (EC)
measurements of turbulent fluxes, an assumed shape of turbulence cospectra is
typically required for high-frequency spectral corrections, typically assuming
a -7/3 power law. The derivation of -7/3 power-law scaling is based primarily
on dimensional analysis, and other cospectral scaling has also been observed.
Here we examine the shape of turbulence cospectra at high wavenumbers from
extensive field measurements of wind velocity, temperature, water vapour and
CO2 concentrations in various stably stratified atmospheric conditions. We
propose a turbulence cospectral shape with -2 power law rather than -7/3 law
for high wavenumber equilibrium range of the stable atmospheric boundary layer.
This finding contributes to improved estimation of turbulent fluxes in both

limit of the vector field. While these studies indicated the importance of
constraints to structural degree of freedoms (SDFs) for global nonlinearity, it
has been still unclear how the constraints to SDF affects local nonlinearity.
Based on statistical manifold, we make intuitive bridge between the SDF-based
information and local nonlinearity, decomposing the local nonlinearity into two
(for binary alloys with pair correlations) or three (for otherwise)
contributions in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, where this
decomposition is independent of temperature and many-body interaction, and is
defined on individual configuration. We also find that we can provide
A-dependent as well as A-independent decomposition of the local nonlinearity,
where non-separability in SDFs and its nonadditive character is independent of
A, which indicates that information about evolution of the vector field should
be required to address the non-separability and nonadditivity. The present work
enables to quantify how configuration-dependent constraints to SDF affect local
nonlinearity in canonical average for multicomponent alloys.

chemical properties of Fe2O3 thin films were determined using XRD and FTIR.
According to XRD, the single phase of Fe2O3 crystallized in the thin film after
annealing. The optical band gap of synthesized Fe2O3 thin films were determined
by UV-Visible spectrums. Gas sensitivity, respond time and recovery time of
Fe2O3 thin films were measured in 1000ppm of CO2 gas using AUTO LAB. Thin films
synthesized by the doctor blade method were thicker and more uniform than the
thin films prepared by the spin coating technique. Gas sensitivity of Fe2O3
films synthesized by the doctor blade method is slightly higher than that of
the films fabricated by the spin coating technique. Fe2O3 films with the PEG
binder posses a higher gas sensitivity, lower respond time and lower recovery
time compared to films without PEG binder. After adding the PEG binder, the
optical band gap of Fe2O3 thin films reduces. The reduction of the activation

consider two cases. In the case where the number of users is smaller than or
equal to that of radio frequency (RF) chains, we propose a low-complexity

the number of users is larger than that of RF chains, we propose a
low-complexity globally convergent alternating algorithm to obtain a stationary

determined without disturbing the future or past state. The original LG
inequalities are only a necessary condition for macrorealism, and are therefore
not a decisive test. We argue, for the case of measurements of a single
dichotomic variable Q, that when the original four three-time LG inequalities
are augmented with a set of twelve two-time inequalities also of the LG form,
Fine's theorem applies and these augmented conditions are then both necessary
and sufficient. A comparison is carried out with the alternative necessary and
sufficient conditions for macrorealism based on no-signaling in time conditions
which ensure that all probabilities for Q at one and two times are independent
of whether earlier or intermediate measurements are made. We argue that the two
tests differ in their implementation of the key requirement of non-invasive
measurability so are testing different notions of macrorealism, and these
notions are elucidated.

two challenges to realizing massive Internet-of-things (IoT) connectivity over
the unlicensed spectrum: the intra-network sharing, i.e., how the spectrum is
shared among IoT devices, and the inter-network sharing, i.e., the coexistence
of the IoT network with other incumbent networks. Specifically, intra-network
sharing is enabled by using extremely narrowband signals to connect a massive
number of IoT devices without any prior network synchronization. Further, to
enhance robustness to incumbent interference, each IoT packet is sent multiple
times, each at a different frequency within a single band. Nevertheless, the
interplay between intra-network sharing and inter-technology coexistence at a
large scale remains unclear. Thus, in this paper, we develop an analytical
framework to model and analyze UNB networks. We use stochastic geometry to
derive the probability of successful transmission, identifying the impact of
intra- and inter-network interference on the performance. In addition to
analyzing the existing single-band access protocols, we present two multiband
schemes, where each BS listens to a single band for practical implementation.
Different access protocols are further compared in terms of the transmission
capacity, i.e., the maximum number of IoT devices a UNB protocol can support in
the presence of incumbent networks. Several design insights are gleaned from
the derived closed-form expressions, and simulation results are further
provided to validate them.

Roozbeh Hazrat, we prove unrelativised version of the standard commutator
formula in the setting of Chevalley groups. Namely, let $\Phi$ be a reduced
irreducible root system of rank $\ge 2$, let $R$ be a commutative ring and let
$I,J$ be two ideals of $R$. We consider subgroups of the Chevalley group
$G(\Phi,R)$ of type $\Phi$ over $R$. The unrelativised elementary subgroup
$E(\Phi,I)$ of level $I$ is generated (as a group) by the elementary unipotents
$x_{\alpha}(\xi)$, $\alpha\in\Phi$, $\xi\in I$, of level $I$. Obviously, in
general $E(\Phi,I)$ has no chances to be normal in $E(\Phi,R)$, its normal
closure in the absolute elementary subgroup $E(\Phi,R)$ is denoted by
$E(\Phi,R,I)$. The main results of [12] implied that the commutator
$\big[E(\Phi,I),E(\Phi,J)]$ is in fact normal in $E(\Phi,R)$. In the present
paper we prove an unexpected result that in fact
$\big[E(\Phi,I),E(\Phi,J)]=\big[E(\Phi,R,I),E(\Phi,R,J)\big]$. It follows that
the standard commutator formula also holds in the unrelativised form, namely
$\big[E(\Phi,I),C(\Phi,R,J)]=\big[E(\Phi,I),E(\Phi,J)\big]$, where
$C(\Phi,R,I)$ is the full congruence subgroup of level $I$. In particular,
$E(\Phi,I)$ is normal in $C(\Phi,R,I)$.

experimental observations that two heavy spheres, immersed into a mono-layer

horizontal direction. Their attraction is so strong that the two spheres remain
bound during hundreds of driving periods. The paper consists of three
independently readable Chapters, with only a few inter-chapter references. The
first Chapter concerns itself with the the motion of a roller amidst a
horizontally shaken sea of poppy seeds, under the Assumption of equal phase for
rotational and translation velocities. The second Chapter details how this
predicts the observed longitudinal diffusion of a single sphere in a bath of
poppy seeds. The third Chapter shows how to retrieve all relevant physical
parameters from experiment: viscosity of the seed bath, friction of the heavy
spheres with the harmonically moving substrate, equilibrium rates for
dissociation of bound pairs or binding of lone pairs, and the full Gibbs
potential surface as a function of experimentally accessible parameters.

media by studying the time-domain poroelastic equations. Both the low frequency
Biot's (LF-Biot) equations and the Biot-Johnson-Koplik-Dashen (Biot-JKD) models
are considered. In LF-Biot equations, the dissipation terms are proportional to
the relative velocity between the fluid and the solid by a constant. Contrast
to this, the dissipation terms in the Biot-JKD model are in the form of time
convolution (memory) as a result of the frequency-dependence of fluid-solid
interaction at the underlying microscopic scale in the frequency domain. The
dynamic tortuosity and permeability described by Darcy's law are two crucial
factors in this problem, and highly linked to the viscous force. In the Biot
model, the key difficulty is to handle the viscous term when the pore fluid is
viscous flow. In the Biot-JKD dynamic permeability model, the convolution
operator involves order $1/2$ shifted fractional derivatives in the time
domain, which is challenging to discretize. In this work, we utilize the
multipoint Pad$\acute{e}$ (or Rational) approximation for Stieltjes function to
approximate the dynamic tortuosity and then obtain an augmented system of
equations which avoids storing the solutions of the past time. The Runge-Kutta
discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method is used to compute the numerical solution,
and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the high order accuracy and
stability of the method.

5--dimensional Riemann metric which arises looks exactly the same as the one
postulated in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) 5-dimensional theory. Nevertheless, there
are deep differences between GUGE and KK. The GUGE metric is deduced while the
KK metric is postulated. In the GUGE field theory there is no need to impose
either of the so called ""cylinder"" or ""curling of coordinates"" conditions,
because they emerge as direct consequences of the construction of the GUGE
metric. The GUGE field equations are fully equivalent to Einstein--Maxwell
equations, while KK field equations are not. The GUGE 5--dimensional (geodesic)
equations are equivalent to the 4--dimensional (non--geodesic) equations for a
charged particle moving in the presence of gravitational and electromagnetic
fields, unlike the KK 5--dimensional (geodesic) equations which are not and, in
addition, yield non--gauge covariant geodesic equations. No extra scalar field
appears in GUGE. The physical interpretation of the fifth dimension and of the
role of the extra field in KK (internal coordinate in GUGE) are totally
different in both approaches. Finally, GUGE results include electric charge
conservation, electric charge quantization and electric charge contribution to
the energy of charged particles even in the absence of electromagnetic fields,
which implies (the observed fact) that there are no massless electrically
charged particles in Nature, unlike the prevailing treatments of KK theories.

range of parameters or variables in order to make predictions at unknown values
of these variables within the same range. The present work illustrates the
application of ML to prediction of physical properties outside the range of the
training parameters. We define `physical extrapolation' to refer to accurate
predictions $y(\mathbf{x^\ast})$ of a given physical property at a point
$\mathbf{x^\ast} = [ x^\ast_1, ..., x^\ast_{\cal D} ]$ in the $\cal
D$-dimensional space, if, at least, one of the variables $x^\ast_i \in \left [

ML models capable of physical extrapolation of quantum properties of complex

models of variable complexity by the evolution of the physical functions. We
show that, as the complexity of the models increases, they become capable of
predicting new transitions. We also show that, where the evolution of the
physical functions is analytic and relatively simple, GP models with simple
kernels already yield accurate generalization results, allowing for accurate
predictions of quantum properties in a different quantum phase. For more
complex problems, it is necessary to build models with complex kernels. The
complexity of the kernels is increased using the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC). We illustrate the importance of the BIC by comparing the results with
random kernels of various complexity and illustrate a method to obtain
meaningful extrapolation results without direct validation in the extrapolated

still open. In this context two dimensional [2D] materials have become a
