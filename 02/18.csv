many model systems in nanoelectronics. When it comes to the question of
controlling the electron spins, more specifically, the magnetism of a system,
tuning with electric field has been proven to be elusive. Recently, magnetic
layered semiconductors have attracted much attention due to their emerging new
physical phenomena. However, challenges still remain in the demonstration of a
gate controllable magnetism based on them. Here, we show that, via ionic
gating, strong field effect can be observed in few-layered semiconducting
Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$Te$_{6}$ devices. At different gate doping, micro-area Kerr
measurements in the studied devices demonstrate tunable magnetization loops
below the Curie temperature, which is tentatively attributed to the moment
re-balance in the spin-polarized band structure. Our findings of electric-field
controlled magnetism in van der Waals magnets pave the way for potential
applications in new generation magnetic memory storage, sensors, and
spintronics.

most CAD systems do not go beyond their use as second opinion tools due to
producing a high number of false positives, which human interpreters need to

several researchers have examined behaviors of radiologists while screening
medical images to better understand how and why they miss tumors, how they
interact with the information in an image, and how they search for unknown
pathology in the images. Eye-tracking tools have been instrumental in exploring
answers to these fundamental questions. In this paper, we aim to develop a
paradigm shift CAD system, called collaborative CAD (C-CAD), that unifies both
of the above mentioned research lines: CAD and eye-tracking. We design an
eye-tracking interface providing radiologists with a real radiology reading

regions with different properties. The permeability is modeled as a
non-stationary stochastic variable, with its log represented as a sum of local
Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansions. The problem is approximated by stochastic
collocation on either tensor-product or sparse grids, coupled with a multiscale
mortar mixed finite element method for the spatial discretization. A
non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm reduces the global problem to a
coarse scale mortar interface problem, which is solved by an iterative solver,
for each stochastic realization. In the traditional implementation, each
subdomain solves a local Dirichlet or Neumann problem in every interface
iteration. To reduce this cost, two additional algorithms based on
deterministic or stochastic multiscale flux basis are introduced. The basis
consists of the local flux (or velocity trace) responses from each mortar
degree of freedom. It is computed by each subdomain independently before the
interface iteration begins. The use of the multiscale flux basis avoids the
need for subdomain solves on each iteration. The deterministic basis is
computed at each stochastic collocation and used only at this realization. The
stochastic basis is formed by further looping over all local realizations of a
subdomain's KL region before the stochastic collocation begins. It is reused
over multiple realizations. Numerical tests are presented to illustrate the
performance of the three algorithms, with the stochastic multiscale flux basis
showing significant savings in computational cost.

predict the missing sign of an edge. In this paper, we introduce a novel
probabilistic approach for the sign prediction problem. The main characteristic
of the proposed models is their ability to adapt to the sparsity level of an
input network. The sparsity of networks is one of the major reasons for the
poor performance of many link prediction algorithms, in general, and sign
prediction algorithms, in particular. Building a model that has an ability to
adapt to the sparsity of the data has not yet been considered in the previous
related works. We suggest that there exists a dilemma between local and global
structures and attempt to build sparsity adaptive models by resolving this
dilemma. To this end, we propose probabilistic prediction models based on local
and global structures and integrate them based on the concept of smoothing. The
model relies more on the global structures when the sparsity increases, whereas
it gives more weights to the information obtained from local structures for low
levels of the sparsity. The proposed model is assessed on three real-world
signed networks, and the experiments reveal its consistent superiority over the
state of the art methods. As compared to the previous methods, the proposed
model not only better handles the sparsity problem, but also has lower
computational complexity and can be updated using real-time data streams.

couple to flexural modes (ZA phonons) at first order. We show that in materials
of this type that also exhibit a Dirac-like electron dispersion, the strong
coupling can result in electron pairing mediated by these phonons, as long as
the flexural modes are not damped or suppressed by additional interactions with
a supporting substrate or gate insulator. We consider several models: The
weak-coupling limit, which is applicable only in the case of gapped and
parabolic materials, like stanene and HfSe$_{2}$, thanks to the weak coupling;
the full gap-equation, solved using the constant-gap approximation and
considering statically screened interactions; its extensions to
energy-dependent gap and to dynamic screening. We argue that in the case of
silicene and germanene superconductivity mediated by this process can exhibit a
critical temperature of a few degrees K, or even a few tens of degrees K when
accounting for the effect of a high-dielectric-constant environment. We

behaviors arises from the number of biomolecules that make up the nucleoplasm
and their pairwise interactions. Indeed, interactions energies that span
several orders of magnitude, from covalent bounds to transient and dynamic
interactions can shape nuclear landscapes. Thus, the nuclear environment
determines how frequently and how fast a TF contacts its target site, and
indirectly gene expression. How exactly transient interactions are involved in
the regulation of TF diffusion is unclear, but are reflected by live cell
imaging techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching or single-particle tracking. Overall, the
macroscopic result of these microscopic interactions is almost always anomalous
diffusion, a phenomenon widely studied and modeled.
  Here, we review the connections between the anomalous diffusion of a TF and
the microscopic organization of the nucleus, including recently described
topologically associated domains and dynamic phase-separated compartments. We
propose that anomalous diffusion found in single particle tracking (SPT) data
result from weak and transient interactions with dynamic nuclear substructures,
and that SPT data analysis would benefit form a better description of such
structures.

that can be observed in numerous geological objects and phenomena. These
geological objects and phenomena are described as containing statistically
selfsimilar patterns often modeled with fractal geometry. Fractal geometry has
been used extensively to characterize pore space and fracture distribution of
both carbonate and clastic rocks as well as the transport properties of porous
media and fluid flow in reservoirs. The fractal properties are usually
estimated from thin-section photomicrograph images or scanning electron
microscope images. For complex rock such as carbonate rocks, automatic feature
detection methods are often inaccurate. In addition, the rocks may be have been
subjected to facies selective diagenesis which preferentially affect some of
the rock fabric, thus increasing the difficulty in automatic detection of
certain features. We present an interactive program, GeoBoxCount, for analyzing
thin-section images and calculating the fractal dimension interactively. The
program relies on the geologists insight in interpreting the features of
interest; this significantly improves the accuracy of feature selection. The
program provides two options for calculating the fractal dimension: the
Hausdorff and the Minkowsi-Bouligand box-counting methods.

a beam experiment by $3.5{\sigma}$ (1% of decay probability), which is
discussed in literature as ""neutron anomaly"" along with the ideas of explaining
it by decay into dark matter partially. The second part of the paper is devoted
to so called ""reactor antineutrino anomaly"", which refers to deficiency of the
measured flux of antineutrino from reactor in respect to the calculated flux by
$3{\sigma}$(deviation by 6.6%). Specific feature of the proposal in this paper
lies in the fact that both anomalies can be accounted for by one and the same
phenomenon of oscillation in baryon sector between a neutron and a neutron of
dark matter $n{\rightarrow}n'$ with mass $m_{n'}$, somewhat less than mass
$m_n$ of an ordinary neutron. Calculations of the proposed model require one
free parameter: mass difference $m_n-m_{n'}$ if one normalizes probability of
oscillations for a free neutron on ""neutron anomaly"" 1%, then, having succeeded
to interpret 6.6% of neutron anomaly in calculations, one can determine mass
difference. According to preliminary estimations, the mass difference is
$m_n-m_{n'}{\approx}$ 3 MeV. However, the analysis of cumulative yields of
isotopes occurs in fission fragments was performed and it does not confirm
possibility of existence of additional decay channel with emission of dark
matter neutron with mass difference $m_n-m_{n'}{\approx}$ 3 MeV. The result of
the analysis is the conclusion that for mirror neutrons the region of the mass
difference $m_n-m_{n'} {\geq}$ 3 MeV is closed. The region of the mass
difference $m_n-m_{n'}{\leq}$ 2 MeV turned out to be not closed.

are geographically distributed and the power amount is random which may not
enough to power a base station by a single energy site. Burning brown energy
sources such as coal and crude oil, though companied with carbon dioxide
emission, provides stable power. In this paper, without sacrificing
communication quality, we investigate how to perform green energy allocation to
abate the dependence on brown energy with hybrid brown and green energy
injected in power networks. We present a comprehensive framework to
characterize the performance of hybrid green and brown energy empowered
cellular network. Novel performance metric ""bits/ton\ce{CO2}/Hz"" is proposed to
evaluate the greenness of the communication network. As green energy is usually
generated from distributed geographical locations and is time varying, online
geographical power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the greenness
of communication network considering electricity transmission's physical laws

geographically distributed green energy sources complement each other by
improving the communication capacity while saving brown energy consumption.
Besides, the penetration of green energy can also help reduce power loss on the

Instead of allowing only two types of block matrices, one for the horizontal

arbitrary matrices in every block. We show that such an integer program can be

superalfvenic fusion products such as alpha particles and the auxiliary heating
ions capable of exciting the Alfv\'enic eigenmodes (AEs). In this work the
effect of AEs on fast ions is formulated within the quasi-linear (QL) theory
generalized for this problem recently. The generalization involves the
resonance line broadened interaction of energetic particles (EP) with AEs
supplemented by the diffusion coefficients depending on EP position in the
velocity space. A new resonance broadened QL code (or RBQ1D) based on this
formulation allowing for EP diffusion in radial direction is built and
presented in details. We reduce the wave particle interaction (WPI) dynamics to
1D case when the particle kinetic energy is nearly constant. The diffusion
equation for EP distribution evolution is then one dimensional and is solved
simultaneously for all particles with the equation for the evolution of the
wave angular momentum. The evolution of fast ion constants of motion is
governed by the QL diffusion equations which are adapted to find the fast ion
distribution function. We make initial applications of the RBQ1D to DIII-D
plasma with elevated q-profile where the beam ions show stiff transport
properties. AE driven fast ion profile relaxation is studied for validations of
the QL approach in realistic conditions of beam ion driven instabilities in
DIII-D.

a laminar vortex ring of diameter D (Re{\Gamma}= 3000) on a fakir-like surface
composed of circular posts of height h*=0.068 located on a planar bed. Lattices
of the posts in hexagonal and random distribution (average porosity of e = 0.94
in the layer) are compared to each other with respect to the plain wall. Prior
to impact, the vortex ring develops the early state of natural azimuthal
instabilities of different mode numbers N=5-7 competing with each other. While
impacting with the rough wall, a secondary ring is observed which is pushed
outwards and is not wrapped around the primary ring as in flat wall impact.
Between both rings of opposite sign vorticity, a strong fluid rebound is
induced. The hexagonal lattice causes the rapid growth of further secondary
vortex structures in a regular mode number N=6 arrangement at the outer edge of
the primary ring in form of six lobes which are aligned with the orientations
of preferential pathways in the layer. At the outer tip of the lobes radial
wall-jets are generated. Rotating the fakir geometry around the centre of
impact also rotates the jets location and direction accordingly. A surface with
random lattice of the posts at the same average number density is not able to
repeat this observation and no regular secondary flow pattern is visible until
full breakdown of the ring. The results show that a tailored arrangement of
such posts can be used for near-wall flow control when patterns of preferred
pathways in the posts layer lock-on with existing instability modes such as in
impacting jet flows or in turbulent boundary layer flows.

then computed using that strian field, by using the constitutive law.
Considering for example a first-order formulation for a homogeneous material,

engender more complex strain fields for polygons which are not triangles. In

edge mode of the structure, i.e. at resonance. We take into account the
transition broadening and the decay of electromagnetic field modes supported by
the so-called `mirror-less' cavity. We employ the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian
to describe the electron interaction with the electromagnetic field, focusing
on the mode with the diffracting polarization in the chiral nematic layer. As
known in these structures, the density of photon states, calculated via the
Wigner method, has distinct peaks on either side of the photonic band gap,
which manifests itself as a considerable modification of the emission spectrum.
We demonstrate that, near resonance, there are notable differences between the
behavior of the density of states and the spontaneous emission profile of these
structures. In addition, we examine in some detail the case of the logarithmic
peak exhibited in the density of states in 2D photonic structures and obtain
analytic relations for the Lamb shift and the broadening of the atomic
transition in the emission spectrum. The dynamical behavior of the atom-field
system is described by a system of two first order differential equations,
solved using the Green's function method and the Fourier transform. The

split loads, a NP-hard problem linked with a variety of applications for bulk
product transportation, bike-sharing systems and inventory re-balancing. This
problem is notoriously difficult due to the interaction of two challenging
vehicle routing attributes, ""pickups and deliveries"" and ""split deliveries"".
This possibly leads to optimal solutions of a size that grows exponentially
with the instance size, containing multiple visits per customer pair, even in
the same route. To solve this problem, we propose an iterated local search
metaheuristic as well as a branch-and-price algorithm. The core of the
metaheuristic consists of a new large neighborhood search, which reduces the
problem of finding the best insertion combination of a pickup and delivery pair
into a route (with possible splits) to a resource-constrained shortest path and
knapsack problem. Similarly, the branch-and-price algorithm uses sophisticated
labeling techniques, route relaxations, pre-processing and branching rules for
an efficient resolution. Our computational experiments on classical
single-vehicle instances demonstrate the excellent performance of the
metaheuristic, which produces new best known solutions for 92 out of 93 test
instances, and outperforms all previous algorithms. Experimental results on new
multi-vehicle instances with distance constraints are also reported. The
branch-and-price algorithm produces optimal solutions for instances with up to
20 pickup-and-delivery pairs, and very accurate solutions are found by the
metaheuristic.

Latour have all emphasized the importance of consensus within scientific
communities of practice. Consensus is important for maintaining legitimacy with
outsiders, orchestrating future research, developing educational curricula and
agreeing industry standards. Low consensus contrastingly undermines a field's
reputation and hinders peer review. Aim: This paper aims to investigate the
degree of consensus within the software engineering academic community
concerning members' implicit theories of software engineering. Method: A
convenience sample of 60 software engineering researchers produced diagrams
describing their personal understanding of causal relationships between core
software engineering constructs. The diagrams were then analyzed for patterns
and clusters. Results: At least three schools of thought may be forming;
however, their interpretation is unclear since they do not correspond to known
divisions within the community (e.g. Agile vs. Plan-Driven methods).
Furthermore, over one third of participants do not belong to any cluster.
Conclusion: Although low consensus is common in social sciences, the rapid pace
of innovation observed in software engineering suggests that high consensus is
achievable given renewed commitment to empiricism and evidence-based practice.

We then perform sensitivity and bifurcation analysis for the DAE system. The
model can be applied either to batch-cycle MECs or to continuous-flow MECs. We
conduct differential-algebraic sensitivity analysis after fitting simulations
to current density data for a batch-cycle MEC. The sensitivity analysis
suggests which parameters have the greatest influence on the current density at
particular times during the experiment. In particular, growth and consumption
parameters for exoelectrogenic bacteria have a strong effect prior to the peak
current density. An alternative strategy to maximizing peak current density is
maintaining a long term stable equilibrium with non-zero current density in a
continuous-flow MEC. We characterize the minimum dilution rate required for a
stable nonzero current equilibrium and demonstrate transcritical bifurcations
in the dilution rate parameter that exchange stability between several curves
of equilibria. Specifically, increasing the dilution rate transitions the
system through three regimes where the stable equilibrium exhibits (i)
competitive exclusion by methanogens, (ii) coexistence, and (iii) competitive
exclusion by exolectrogens. Positive long term current production is only
feasible in the final two regimes. These results suggest how to modify system
parameters to increase peak current density in a batch-cycle MEC or to increase

to provide a large acceptance for 100 MeV electrons and reach at these

focus on the impact of Coulomb correlations at the bound state on spin
polarization and sheet density kinetics of the charge carriers in the QW. The
theoretical approach is based on kinetic equations for the electron occupation

enhanced dynamic spin polarization of the electrons in the QW and a delay in
the carriers tunneling into the bound state. The interplay of these two effects
leads to non-trivial dependence of the spin polarization degree, which can be
probed experimentally using time-resolved photoluminescence experiments. It is
demonstrated that the influence of the Coulomb interactions can be controlled

optimization problems involving spectral functions of parametric matrices, e.g.
log-determinant and nuclear norm. Unfortunately, computing the gradient of a
spectral function is generally of cubic complexity, as such gradient descent
methods are rather expensive for optimizing objectives involving the spectral
function. Thus, one naturally turns to stochastic gradient methods in hope that
they will provide a way to reduce or altogether avoid the computation of full
gradients. However, here a new challenge appears: there is no straightforward
way to compute unbiased stochastic gradients for spectral functions. In this
paper, we develop unbiased stochastic gradients for spectral-sums, an important
subclass of spectral functions. Our unbiased stochastic gradients are based on
combining randomized trace estimators with stochastic truncation of the
Chebyshev expansions. A careful design of the truncation distribution allows us
to offer distributions that are variance-optimal, which is crucial for fast and
stable convergence of stochastic gradient methods. We further leverage our
proposed stochastic gradients to devise stochastic methods for objective

favours the lamellar phase in the passive limit, we show that the interplay
between nonequilibrium and thermodynamic forces creates a range of multifarious
exotic emulsions. When the active component is contractile (e.g., an actomyosin
solution), moderate activity enhances the efficiency of lamellar ordering,
whereas strong activity favours the creation of passive droplets within an

high internal phase emulsions, which undergo sudden phase inversion when

systems, due to local inversion symmetry breaking, a Rashba spin-orbit coupling
is induced at the outer layers. This combined with a perpendicular paramagnetic
(Pauli) limiting magnetic field stabilizes a staggered layer dependent
pair-density wave phase in the superconducting singlet channel. The high-field
pair-density wave phase is separated from the low-field BCS phase by a
first-order phase transition. The motivating guiding question in this paper is:
what is the minimal necessary Maki parameter $\alpha_M$ for the appearance of
the pair-density wave phase of a superconducting trilayer system? To address
this problem we generalize the circular cell method for the regular flux-line
lattice of a type-II superconductor to include paramagnetic depairing effects.
Then, we apply the model to the trilayer system, where each of the layers are
characterized by Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa_0$, and a Maki parameter
$\alpha_M$. We find that when the spin-orbit Rashba interaction compares to the

i.e., new data arrives at different time intervals. As a result, the tensors
used to represent the data grow in size. Besides the tensors, in many real

which also grow in size with time. The problem of predicting missing values in
the dynamically growing tensor is called dynamic tensor completion. Most of the
previous work in dynamic tensor completion make an assumption that the tensor
grows only in one mode. To the best of our Knowledge, there is no previous work
which incorporates side information with dynamic tensor completion. We bridge
this gap in this paper by proposing a dynamic tensor completion framework

incorporates side information and works for general incremental tensors. We
also show how non-negative constraints can be incorporated with SIITA, which is
essential for mining interpretable latent clusters. We carry out extensive

would hope that the performance in a gradually typed language would range

Existing implementations of gradually typed languages have not achieved this
goal due to overheads associated with runtime casts. Takikawa et al. (2016)
report up to 100$\times$ slowdowns for partially typed programs. In this paper
we present a compiler, named Grift, for evaluating implementation techniques
for gradual typing. We take a straightforward but surprisingly unexplored
implementation approach for gradual typing, that is, ahead-of-time compilation
to native assembly code with carefully chosen runtime representations and
space-efficient coercions.
  Our experiments show that this approach achieves performance on par with
OCaml on statically typed programs and performance between that of Gambit and
Racket on untyped programs. On partially typed code, the geometric mean ranges
from 0.42$\times$ to 2.36$\times$ that of (untyped) Racket across the
benchmarks. We implement casts using the coercions of Siek, Thiemann, and
Wadler (2015). This technique eliminates all catastrophic slowdowns without
introducing significant overhead. Across the benchmarks, coercions range from
15% slower (fft) to almost 2$\times$ faster (matmult) than regular casts. We
also implement the monotonic references of Siek et al. (2015). Monotonic
references eliminate all overhead in statically typed code, and for partially

1.48$\times$.

categories of D-modules. In the present work, we follow up this theme. We show
that a certain class of affine group schemes of ""infinite type"", Neron blowups
of formal subgroups, are quite typical. We also explain how these group schemes
appear naturally in Tannakian categories of D-modules. To conclude, we isolate
a Tannakian property of affine group schemes, named prudence, which allows one
to verify if the underlying ring of functions is a free module over the base
ring. This is then successfully applied to obtain a general result on the
structure of differential Galois groups over complete DVRs.

intergalactic medium are poorly known. To understand how Lyman continuum (LyC)
photons escape galaxies, we constrain the HI covering fractions and column
densities using ultraviolet HI and metal absorption lines of 18 star-forming
galaxies which have Lyman series observations. Nine of these galaxies are
confirmed LyC emitters. We fit the stellar continuum, dust attenuation, metal,
and HI properties to consistently determine the UV attenuation, as well as the
column densities and covering factors of neutral hydrogen and metals. We use
synthetic interstellar absorption lines to explore the systematics of our
measurements. Then we apply our method to the observed UV spectra of
low-redshift and z-2 galaxies. The observed HI lines are found to be saturated
in all galaxies. An indirect approach using OI column densities and the
observed O/H abundances yields HI column densities of 18.6 to 20 cm-2. These
columns are too high to allow the escape of ionizing photons. We find that the
known LyC leakers have HI covering fractions less than unity. Ionizing photons
escape through optically thin holes/channels in a clumpy interstellar medium.
Our simulations confirm that the HI covering fractions are accurately
recovered. The SiII and HI covering fractions scale linearly, in agreement with
observations from stacked Lyman break galaxy spectra at z-3. Thus, with an
empirical correction, the SiII absorption lines can also be used to determine
the HI coverage. Finally, we show that a consistent fitting of dust
attenuation, continuum and absorption lines is required to properly infer the
covering fraction of neutral gas and subsequently to infer the escape fraction
of ionizing radiation. These measurements can estimate the LyC escape fraction,
as we demonstrate in a companion paper.

that the umbra of sunspot moves in long-term oscillations as a whole: all its

Focusing on a class of two-layer neural networks defined by smooth (but

dimension and show that it provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the
absence of spurious valleys. More concretely, finite intrinsic dimension
guarantees that for sufficiently overparametrised models no spurious valleys
exist, independently of the data distribution. Conversely, infinite intrinsic
dimension implies that spurious valleys do exist for certain data
distributions, independently of model overparametrisation. Besides these
positive and negative results, we show that, although spurious valleys may
exist in general, they are confined to low risk levels and avoided with high
probability on overparametrised models.

This means that a discrete time model is arbitrage-free if and only if there
does not exist a one-period-arbitrage. With capital gains taxes, this
equivalence fails. For a model with a linear tax and one non-shortable risky
stock, we introduce the concept of robust local no-arbitrage (RLNA) as the
weakest local condition which guarantees dynamic no-arbitrage. Under a sharp
dichotomy condition, we prove (RLNA). Since no-one-period-arbitrage is
necessary for no-arbitrage, the latter is sandwiched between two local
conditions, which allows us to estimate its non-locality.
  Furthermore, we construct a stock price process such that two long positions
in the same stock hedge each other. This puzzling phenomenon that cannot occur
in arbitrage-free frictionless markets (or markets with proportional
transaction costs) is used to show that no-arbitrage alone does not imply the
existence of an equivalent separating measure if the probability space is
infinite.

written as a model with proportional transaction costs by introducing several
fictitious securities.

vanishes, by construction, our choice of penalty parameters yield an upwind

play an important role in our conceptual understanding of bars. Such orbits are
found in some well-studied potentials, provide a simple model of the bar in
themselves, and may generate complex orbit families. The precessing, power
ellipse (p-ellipse) orbit approximation provides accurate analytic orbit orbits
in symmetric galaxy potentials. It remains useful for finding and fitting
simple loop orbits in the frame of a rotating bar with bar-like and symmetric
power-law potentials. Second order perturbation theory yields two or fewer
simple loop solutions in these potentials. Numerical integrations in the
parameter space neighborhood of perturbation solutions reveal zero or one ac-
tual loops in a range of such potentials with rising rotation curves. These
loops are embedded in a small parameter region of similar, but librating
orbits, which have a subharmonic frequency superimposed on the basic loop.
These loops and their librat- ing companions support annular bars. Solid bars
can be produced in more complex potentials, as shown by an example with
power-law indices varying with radius. The power-law potentials can be viewed
as the elementary constituents of more complex potentials. Numerical
integrations also reveal interesting classes of orbits with multiple loops. In
two-dimensional, self-gravitating bars, with power-law potentials, single loop
orbits are very rare. This result suggests that gas bars or oval distortions
are unlikely to be long-lived, and that complex orbits or three-dimensional

adaptation method, for picking up objects using a combination of exteroceptive
3D perception and proprioceptive force/torque sensor feedback. The method works
in two iterative stages to provide reliable and wrist torque efficient grasps.
Initially, a geometric object CoM is estimated from the input range data. In
the first stage, a set of hand-size handle grasps are localized on the object
and the closest to its CoM is selected for grasping. In the second stage, the
object is lifted using a single arm, while the force and torque readings from
the sensor on the wrist are monitored. Based on these readings, a displacement
to the new CoM estimation is calculated. The object is released and the process
is repeated until the wrist torque effort is minimized. The advantage of our
method is the blending of both exteroceptive (3D range) and proprioceptive
(force/torque) sensing for finding the grasp location that minimizes the wrist
effort, potentially improving the reliability of the grasping and the

the probability distribution function (PDF) of density perturbations in real

must relate the power spectrum in Fourier space to the PDF in real space by
coarse-graining the perturbations with a window function. However, there are

virtual excitations of fermion and photon fields. By rewriting the generating
functional of quantum electrodynamics theory as an inner product between
quantum operators, it is possible to obtain quantum density operators
representing the propagation of real and virtual particles. These operators are
partial traces, where the degrees of freedom traced out are unobserved
excitations. Then the Von Neumann definition of entropy can be applied to these
quantum operators and in particular, for the partial traces taken over the
internal or external degrees of freedom. A universal behavior is obtained for
the entanglement entropy for different quantum fields at zero order in the
coupling constant. In order to obtain numerical results at different orders in
the perturbation expansion, the Bloch-Nordsieck model is considered, where it
it shown that for some particular values of the electric charge, the von
Neumann entropy increases or decreases with respect to the non-interacting
case.

applications, such as detecting communities in social networks and mining gene
correlation from biological data. Most studies on dense subgraph mining only
deal with one graph. However, in many applications, we have more than one graph
describing relations among a same group of entities. In this paper, given two
graphs sharing the same set of vertices, we investigate the problem of
detecting subgraphs that contrast the most with respect to density. We call
such subgraphs Density Contrast Subgraphs, or DCS in short. Two widely used
graph density measures, average degree and graph affinity, are considered. For
both density measures, mining DCS is equivalent to mining the densest subgraph
from a ""difference"" graph, which may have both positive and negative edge
weights. Due to the existence of negative edge weights, existing dense subgraph
detection algorithms cannot identify the subgraph we need. We prove the
computational hardness of mining DCS under the two graph density measures and
develop efficient algorithms to find DCS. We also conduct extensive experiments
on several real-world datasets to evaluate our algorithms. The experimental
results show that our algorithms are both effective and efficient.

implications. Location-privacy preserving mechanisms, such as obfuscation,
anonymization and cryptographic primitives, have been shown to have impractical
utility/privacy tradeoff. Another solution for enhancing user privacy is to
minimize data sharing by executing the tasks conventionally carried out at the
service providers' end on the users' smartphones. Although the data volume
shared with the untrusted entities is significantly reduced, executing
computationally demanding server-side tasks on resource-constrained smartphones
is often impracticable. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on lowering
the computational complexity by treating spatiotemporal trajectories as
space-time signals. Lowering the data dimensionality facilitates offloading the
computational tasks onto the digital-signal processors and the usage of the
non-blocking signal-processing pipelines. While focusing on the task of user
mobility modeling, we achieve the following results in comparison to the state
of the art techniques: (i) mobility models with precision and recall greater
than 80%, (ii) reduction in computational complexity by a factor of 2.5, and
(iii) reduction in power consumption by a factor of 0.5. Furthermore, our
technique does not rely on users' behavioral parameters that usually result in
privacy-leakage and conclusive bias in the existing techniques. Using three
real-world mobility datasets, we demonstrate that our technique addresses these
weaknesses while formulating accurate user mobility models.

associated task completion in an unknown environment with multiple
resource-constrained and self-interested Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is
studied. The UAVs form several coalitions to efficiently complete the compound
tasks which are impossible to be performed individually. The objectives of such
coalition formation are to firstly minimize resource consumption in completing
the encountered tasks on time, secondly to enhance the reliability of the
coalitions, and lastly in segregating the most trusted UAVs amid the self
interested of them. As many previous publications have merely focused on
minimizing costs, this study considers a multi-objective optimization coalition
formation problem that considers the three aforementioned objectives. In doing
so, a leader-follower- inspired coalition formation algorithm amalgamating the
three objectives to address the problem of the computational complexity of
coalition formation in large-scale UAV networks is proposed. This algorithm
attempts to form the coalitions with minimally exceeding the required resources
for the encountered tasks while maximizing the number of completed tasks. The
proposed algorithm is based on Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms(QEA) which are a
combination of quantum computing and evolutionary algorithms. Results from
simulations show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the
existing coalition formation algorithms such as merge-and-split and a famous
multi-objective genetic algorithm called NSGA-II.

intersections. A chance constraint is appended to the optimal control problem
to incorporate robustness with respect to uncertain signal timing. The optimal
eco-driving control problem is solved via dynamic programming (DP). Simulation
results demonstrate that the optimal eco-driving can save fuel consumption by
50-57% while maintaining arrival time at the same level, compared with a

significantly reduces traffic intersection violations, in the face of uncertain

pentacene and pentacene aggregates are bound only by van der Waals forces which
are notoriously difficult to describe with DFT and DFTB, (ii) the proper
description of the long-range coupling between molecules, needed to describe
Davydov splitting, is not easy to include in TD-DFT with traditional
functionals and in TD-DFTB, and (iii) mixing may occur between local and charge
transfer excitons, which may, in turn, require special functionals. We assess
how far TD-DFT and TD-DFTB have progressed towards a correct description of
this type of exciton by including both a dispersion correction for the ground
state and a range-separated hybrid functional for the excited state. Analytic
results for parallel-stacked ethylene are derived which go beyond Kasha's
exciton model in that we are able to make a clear distinction between charge
transfer and energy transfer excitons. This is further confirmed when it is
shown that range-separated hybrids have a markedly greater effect on
charge-transfer excitons than on energy-transfer excitons in the case of
parallel-stacked pentacenes. TD-DFT calculations with the CAM-B3LYP functional
and TD-lc-DFT calculations lead to negligeable excitonic corrections for the
herringbone crystal structure, possibly because of an overcorrection of
charge-transfer effects. In this case, TD-DFT calculations with the B3LYP
