concept in neural science literature, we propose Synaptic Pruning: a
data-driven method to prune connections between input and output feature maps
with a newly proposed class of parameters called Synaptic Strength. Synaptic
Strength is designed to capture the importance of a connection based on the
amount of information it transports. Experiment results show the effectiveness
of our approach. On CIFAR-10, we prune connections for various CNN models with
up to 96% , which results in significant size reduction and computation saving.
Further evaluation on ImageNet demonstrates that synaptic pruning is able to
discover efficient models which is competitive to state-of-the-art compact CNNs
such as MobileNet-V2 and NasNet-Mobile. Our contribution is summarized as
following: (1) We introduce Synaptic Strength, a new class of parameters for
CNNs to indicate the importance of each connections. (2) Our approach can prune
various CNNs with high compression without compromising accuracy. (3) Further
investigation shows, the proposed Synaptic Strength is a better indicator for
kernel pruning compared with the previous approach in both empirical result and

increasingly important to intuitively group, categorize, or classify text data
by theme for efficient retrieval and search. Yet, the high dimensionality and
imprecision of text data, or more generally language as a whole, prove to be
challenging when attempting to perform unsupervised document clustering. In
this thesis, we present two novel methods for improving unsupervised document
clustering/classification by theme. The first is to improve document
representations. We look to exploit ""term neighborhoods"" and ""blur"" semantic
weight across neighboring terms. These neighborhoods are located in the
semantic space afforded by ""word embeddings."" The second method is for cluster
revision, based on what we deem as ""stochastic barcoding"", or ""S- Barcode""
patterns. Text data is inherently high dimensional, yet clustering typically
takes place in a low dimensional representation space. Our method utilizes
lower dimension clustering results as initial cluster configurations, and
iteratively revises the configuration in the high dimensional space. We show
with experimental results how both of the two methods improve the quality of
document clustering. While this thesis elaborates on the two new conceptual
contributions, a joint thesis by David Yan details the feature transformation
and software architecture we developed for unsupervised document

different representations of a theory, regarded as the consequence of
invariance of the laws of physics -- represented by an action principle and the
derived motion equations -- under given transformations; be it coordinate,
gauge or conformal transformations. Accordingly the conformal transformations'
issue is discussed by invoking the assumed invariance of the laws of physics --
in particular the laws of gravity -- under conformal transformations of the
metric. It is shown that Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor theories are not
well-suited to address physical equivalence of the conformal frames since the
corresponding laws of gravity are not invariant under the conformal
transformations or Weyl rescalings. The search for conformal symmetry leads us
to explore the physical consequences of Weyl-invariant theories of gravity,
that represent a natural arena where to discuss on physical equivalence of the
conformally related representations. We show that conformal invariance of the
action of a (supposedly conformal invariant) theory and of the derived motion
equations is not enough to ensure actual Weyl invariance. It is required, also,
that the underlying geometrical structure of the background spacetime be, at
least, Weyl-integrable. Otherwise, if assume (as usual) spacetimes of
(pseudo)Riemannian geometrical structure, the resulting -- apparently conformal
invariant -- theory is anomalous in that, only massless matter fields can be
consistently coupled. Gauge freedom, a distinctive feature of actually
Weyl-invariant theories of gravity, leads to very unusual consequences.

utmost relevance to both human activities and natural environment. One of the
their most intriguing and less understood behavior, is the stick-instability,
whose most dramatic manifestation are earthquakes, ultimately governed by the
dynamics of rocks and debris jammed within the fault gauge. Many of the
features of earthquakes, i.e. intermittency, broad times and energy scale
involved, are mimicked by a very simple experimental set-up, where small beads
of glass under load are slowly sheared by an elastic medium. Analyzing data
from long lasting experiments, we identify a critical dynamical regime, that
can be related to known theoretical models used for ""crackling-noise""
phenomena. In particular, we focus on the average shape of the slip velocity,
observing a ""breakdown of scaling"": while small slips show a self-similar
shape, large does not, in a way that suggests the presence of subtle inertial
effects within the granular system. In order to characterise the crossover
between the two regimes, we investigate the frictional response of the system,
which we trat as a stochastic quantity. Computing different averages, we
evidence a weakening effect, whose Stribeck threshold velocity can be related
to the aforementioned breaking of scaling.

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in fixed chirality host crystals. Thus
far, there have been relatively few investigations of the DMI in metallic
magnets as compared with insulating counterparts. Here, we focus on the

method of successive averages (MSA). A novel network loading model inspired
from Link transmission model is developed that accepts policies as inputs for
solving the problem. This network loading model is different from the existing

through molecular and lattice dynamic calculations, revealing the material to
show large dynamic responses on a wide range of time scales. Longer length
scales in the material was simulated with effective classical potentials,
showing that complex domains can be generated by the interacting molecular
dipoles, generating structured features in the electrostatic potential of the
lattice. Relativistic electronic structure reveals unique features in the
bands, which may explain observed slow recombination, and could be used in high

a strong drive for the formation of polarons, some device physics of which are
discussed. These polarons offer a possible explanation for the observed slow

straightforward. However, these models are still not widely used since they
come at a high computational cost, and because they are formulated in such a

showing their equivalence to Spectral Mixture Gaussian processes, we illuminate
the underlying model assumptions and provide a general framework for

Our interpretation makes it intuitive to inspect, compare, and alter the models

$-$ describing a system of spinless fermions hopping on a two-leg ladder
pierced by a magnetic field $-$ the gap closing at the quantum phase transition
between the two topologically nontrivial phases of the model can be moved by
tuning the hopping amplitudes. We take advantage of this property to examine
the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model after a sudden quench of the magnetic
flux through the plaquettes of the ladder. For a quench to one of the
equilibrium quantum critical points we find that the revival period of the
Loschmidt echo $-$ measuring the overlap between initial and time-evolved
states $-$ is controlled by the gap closing zero-energy modes. In particular,
and contrary to expectations, the revival period of the Loschmidt echo for a
finite ladder does not scale linearly with size but exhibits jumps determined
by the presence or absence of zero-energy modes. We further investigate the
conditions for the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions in the
model and find that, for a quench {\em to} an equilibrium critical point, such
transitions occur only for ladders of sizes which host zero-energy modes.
Exploiting concepts from quantum thermodynamics, we show that the average work
and the irreversible work per lattice site exhibit a weak dependence on the
size of the system after a quench {\em across} an equilibrium critical point,
suggesting that quenching into a different phase induces effective correlations

positive economics and welfare analysis. Overwhelming evidence shows that
choice is stochastic, which has given rise to random utility models as the
dominant paradigm in applied microeconomics. However, as is well known, it is
not possible to infer the structure of preferences in the absence of
assumptions on the structure of noise. This makes it impossible to empirically
test the structure of noise independently from the structure of preferences.
Here, we show that the difficulty can be bypassed if data sets are enlarged to
include response times. A simple condition on response time distributions (a
weaker version of first order stochastic dominance) ensures that choices reveal
preferences without assumptions on the structure of utility noise. Sharper
results are obtained if the analysis is restricted to specific classes of
models. Under symmetric noise, response times allow to uncover preferences for
choice pairs outside the data set, and if noise is Fechnerian, even choice
probabilities can be forecast out of sample. We conclude by showing that
standard random utility models from economics and standard drift-diffusion
models from psychology necessarily generate data sets fulfilling our sufficient
condition on response time distributions.

subdomains of the system. It can also change with time within a given
subdomain. The methods are linearly conservative, preserving a wide class of
analytically constant quantities to numerical roundoff, even when numerical
truncation error is significantly higher. These methods are intended for use in
solving conservative PDEs in discontinuous Galerkin formulations or in
finite-difference methods with compact stencils. A numerical test demonstrates
these properties and shows that significant speed improvements over the

involve a generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM)-based modem as a
core part of the baseband processing. Some are based on GFDM with a single
prototype filter, e.g. orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and
others employ multiple filters such as filter bank multicarrier (FBMC).
Moreover, the GFDM degrees of freedom combined with multiple prototype filters
design allow the development and optimization of new waveforms. Nevertheless,
GFDM has been widely considered as a complex modulation because of the
requirements of odd number of subcarriers or subsymbols. Accordingly, the
current state of the art implementations consume high resources. One solution
to reduce the complexity is utilizing radix-2 parameters. Due to the
advancement in GFDM filter design, the constraint of using odd parameters has
been overcome and radix-2 realization is now possible. In this paper, we
propose a unified low complexity architecture that can be reconfigured to
provide both time-domain and frequency-domain modulation/demodulation. The
design consists of several radix-2 fast Fourier transform (FFT) and memory
blocks, in addition to one complex multiplier. Moreover, we provide a unified
architecture for the state of the art implementations, which is designed based
on direct computation of circular convolution using parallel multiplier chains.
As we demonstrate in this work, the FFTbased architecture is computationally
more efficient, provides more flexibility, significantly reduces the resource
consumption, and achieves similar latency for larger block size.

conformation tensor, which is a positive-definite tensor representing polymer
deformation in viscoelastic flows. The classical approach does not explicitly
take into account that the perturbed tensor must remain positive definite---a
fact that has important physical implications, e.g. extensions and compressions
are represented similarly to within a negative sign, when physically the former
are unbounded and the latter are bounded from below. Mathematically, the
classical approach assumes that the underlying geometry is Euclidean, and this
assumption is not satisfied by the manifold of positive definite tensors. We
provide an alternative formulation that retains the conveniences of classical
perturbation methods used for generating linear and weakly nonlinear
expansions, but also provides a clear physical interpretation and a
mathematical basis for analysis. The approach is based on treating a
perturbation as a sequence of successively smaller deformations of the polymer.
Each deformation is modelled explicitly using geodesics on the manifold of
positive-definite tensors. Using geodesics, and associated geodesic distances,
is the natural way to model perturbations to positive-definite tensors because
it is consistent with the manifold geometry. Approximations of the geodesics
can then be used to reduce the total deformation to a series expansion in the
small perturbation limit. We illustrate our approach using direct numerical
simulations of the nonlinear evolution of Tollmien-Schlichting waves.

the total distortion in the estimated signal but also split it in terms of
various factors such as remaining interference, newly added artifacts, and

of the universe is tied to its singularity structure and its behaviour as such
singularities are approached. One important singularity is identified by the
vanishing of the total energy, where the wavefunction reduces to the physics of
scattering in flat space. In this paper, we discuss the behaviour of the
perturbative wavefunction as its other singularities are approached and the
role played by the flat-space scattering, in the simplified context of the
class of toy models admitting a first principle definition in terms of
cosmological polytopes. The problems then translates into the analysis of the
structure of its facets, one of which -- the scattering facet -- beautifully
encodes the flat-space S-matrix. We show that all the boundaries of the
cosmological polytope encode information about the flat-space physics. In
particular, a subset of its facets turns out to have a similar structure as the
scattering facet, with the vertices which can be grouped together to form lower
dimensional scattering facets. The other facets admit one (and only one)
triangulation in terms of products of lower dimensional scattering facets. As a
consequence, the whole perturbative wavefunction can be represented as a sum of
product of flat-space scattering amplitudes. Finally, we turn the table around
and ask whether the knowledge of the flat-space scattering amplitudes suffices
to reconstruct the wavefunction of the universe. We show that, at least for our
class of toy models, this is indeed the case at tree level if we are also
provided with a subset of symmetries that the wavefunction ought to satisfy.
Once the tree cosmological polytopes are reconstructed, the loop ones can be
obtained as a particular projection of them.

simulate the dynamics of new liquid drops from captured real-world liquid flow
data, using deep neural networks. To achieve this goal, we develop a data
capture system that acquires liquid flow patterns from hundreds of real-world
water drops. We then convert raw data into compact data for training neural
networks, in which liquid drops are represented by their contact fronts in a
Lagrangian form. Using the LSTM units based on recurrent neural networks, our
neural networks serve three purposes in our simulator: predicting the contour
of a contact front, predicting the color field gradient of a contact front, and
finally predicting whether a contact front is going to break or not. Using
these predictions, our simulator recovers the overall shape of a liquid drop at
every time step, and handles merging and splitting events by simple operations.
The experiment shows that our trained neural networks are able to perform
predictions well. The whole simulator is robust, convenient to use, and capable
of generating realistic small-scale liquid effects in animation.

of spin squeezing for collective spins composed of the physical angular momenta

metrological squeezing of $\gtrsim -5$dB was generated by quantum backaction

measurement strength. Other significant developments include the successful
application of composite pulse techniques for accurate dynamical control of the

possibility that these breather oscillations may become subharmonically
entrained to the periodic perturbation occurring at the resonator round-trip

entrainment is an integer ratio $T_b/T_R=N\gg1$ between the breather period
$T_b$ and the round-trip time. We find that in a regime of intermediate

locking of the breather oscillation to the round-trip time---occurs and is
maintained over a range of system parameters. We observe entrainment with an

effect with higher entrainment ratios and at higher finesse. This system's

and correctly execute any two-party computation. Namely, in case the channel
erases $T$ transmissions, the coding scheme will take $N+2T$ transmissions
using an alphabet of size $4$ (alternatively, using $2N+4T$ transmissions over
a binary channel) to correctly simulate any binary protocol that takes $N$
transmissions assuming a noiseless channel. We can further reduce the
communication to $N+T$ by relaxing the communication model and allowing parties
to remain silent rather than forcing them to communicate in every round of the
coding scheme.
  Our coding schemes are efficient, deterministic, have linear overhead both in
their communication and round complexity, and succeed (with probability 1)
regardless of the number of erasures $T$.

(RNNLM) are typically used to refine hypotheses in the form of lattices or
n-best lists, which are generated by a beam search decoder with a weaker
language model. The RNNLMs are usually trained generatively using the
perplexity (PPL) criterion on large corpora of grammatically correct text.
However, the hypotheses are noisy, and the RNNLM doesn't always make the
choices that minimise the metric we optimise for, the word error rate (WER). To
address this mismatch we propose to use a task specific loss to train an RNNLM
to discriminate between multiple hypotheses within lattice rescoring scenario.
By fine-tuning the RNNLM on lattices with the average edit distance loss, we
show that we obtain a 1.9% relative improvement in word error rate over a
purely generatively trained model.

Interestingly in this work, we find specific classes of 1D structure without

manifest as phase cut lines(PCLs) in our specially designed synthetic photonic
crystals(SPCs). Zak phase defined in SIS is extended to depict the topology of
PCLs after redefinition and topological protected edge state is also achieved
in our 1D structure without SIS. In our SPCs, the relationship between Chern
numbers in two-dimension(2D) and the extended Zak phases of 1D PCLs is given,
which are bound by the first type singularities. Higher Chern numbers and multi
chiral edge states are achieved utilizing the concept of synthetic dimensions.
The effective Hamiltonian is given, based on which we find that the band edges
of each PCLs play a role analogous to the valley pseudospin and our SPC is
actually a new type of valley photonic crystal which is usually studied in
graphene-like honeycomb lattice. The chiral valley edge transport is also
demonstrated. In higher dimension, the shift of the first type singularity in
expanded parameter space will lead to the Weyl point topological transition
which we proposed in our previous work. In this paper, we find a second type of
singularities which manifests as a singular surface in our expanded parameter
space. The shift of the singular surface will lead to the nodal line
topological transition. Astonishingly, we find the states on the singular
surface possess extremely high robust against certain randomness, based on

observations can constrain the graviton mass when screening effects are taken
into account. We first consider model-independent corrections to the
propagation of gravitational waves due to screened massive graviton effects. We
find that future observation can place constraints on the screening radius and
the graviton mass of ${\cal{O}}(10^{2})$--${\cal{O}}(10^{4})$ Mpc and
${\cal{O}}(10^{-22})$--${\cal{O}}(10^{-26})$ eV respectively. We also consider
screening effects in two specific theories, ghost-free massive gravity and
bigravity, that might not realize these types of propagation modifications, but
that do provide analytic expressions for screening parameters relevant to our
analysis allowing for more concrete results. However, the constraints we are
able to place are small. The reason for this is that second- and
third-generation detectors are sensitive to graviton masses that lead to very
small screening radii in these particular models. The effect of screening,
however, can become important as constraints on the graviton mass are improved
through the stacking of multiple observations in the near future.

become more volatile due to increased integration of renewables that are
intermittent. The issue of price volatility is further heightened during
periods of grid congestion. Motivated by these problems, we propose a market
design where, by constraining dual variables, we determine the amount of

electricity and through demand-side flexibility hedge against price volatility.
For achieving this, an organizational structure for flexibility management is
proposed that exhibits the coordination required between the Distribution

demonstrate the viability of our proposed formulation, we run an illustrative

understand the intelligence process well enough to enable the development of
adequate computational models. Much work has been done in AI over the years at
lower levels, but a big part of what has been missing involves the high level,
abstract, general nature of intelligence. We address this gap by developing a
model for general intelligence. To accomplish this, we focus on three basic
aspects of intelligence. First, we must realize the general order and nature of
intelligence at a high level. Second, we must come to know what these
realizations mean with respect to the overall intelligence process. Third, we
must describe these realizations as clearly as possible. We propose a
hierarchical model to help capture and exploit the order within intelligence.
The underlying order involves patterns of signals that become organized, stored
and activated in space and time. These patterns can be described using a
simple, general hierarchy, with physical signals at the lowest level,
information in the middle, and abstract signal representations at the top. This
high level perspective provides a big picture that literally helps us see the
intelligence process, thereby enabling fundamental realizations, a better
understanding and clear descriptions of the intelligence process. The resulting
model can be used to support all kinds of information processing across
multiple levels of abstraction. As computer technology improves, and as
cooperation increases between humans and computers, people will become more
efficient and more productive in performing their information processing tasks.

wide range of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. Maximum-Likelihood (MLE)
models trained with teacher forcing have consistently been reported as weak
baselines, where poor performance is attributed to exposure bias (Bengio et
al., 2015; Ranzato et al., 2015); at inference time, the model is fed its own
prediction instead of a ground-truth token, which can lead to accumulating
errors and poor samples. This line of reasoning has led to an outbreak of
adversarial based approaches for NLG, on the account that GANs do not suffer
from exposure bias. In this work, we make several surprising observations which
contradict common beliefs. First, we revisit the canonical evaluation framework
for NLG, and point out fundamental flaws with quality-only evaluation: we show
that one can outperform such metrics using a simple, well-known temperature
parameter to artificially reduce the entropy of the model's conditional
distributions. Second, we leverage the control over the quality / diversity
trade-off given by this parameter to evaluate models over the whole
quality-diversity spectrum and find MLE models constantly outperform the
proposed GAN variants over the whole quality-diversity space. Our results have
several implications: 1) The impact of exposure bias on sample quality is less
severe than previously thought, 2) temperature tuning provides a better quality
/ diversity trade-off than adversarial training while being easier to train,
easier to cross-validate, and less computationally expensive. Code to reproduce

Positive long-range correlations arise from multiple scattering in fiber mode

optimizing the incident wavefront of a pulse, we maximize the power transmitted
at a selected time, and such control is significantly enhanced by the
long-range spatio-temporal correlations. We provide an explicit relation

spacetime geometry in terms of a Lorentzian metric physically from more general
geometric structures. Our approach to this question is operational and leads us
to also revisit the notion of local inertial frames, arising in operational
formulations of the equivalence and Mach's principle, both of which can be
interpreted in generalized geometries. We extend the notion of inertial
laboratory frames by taking serious that all matter inside the lab is
fundamentally quantum and considering how it may couple to the quantum
gravitational degrees of freedom generating the ambient effective spacetime
structure. This revolves around the question of which structures an agent
inside the inertial laboratory has available to operationally define the
orientation of their reference frame, an aspect on which both the equivalence
and Mach's principle are silent. We then contemplate the situation of a
completely inertial laboratory, which, in terms of the quantum matter
experiments inside it, is not only isolated from any matter outside it, but
also from a direct coupling to effective quantum gravitational degrees of
freedom. We formulate this as a local Mach principle (LMP): a local inertial
laboratory has to be self-sufficient, so that an agent can only resort to
relations among the quantum matter systems inside it to self-generate any
reference structures relative to which to orient their frame. The
transformations between different frame orientations thereby originate in the
local quantum matter structures. Combining this with dispersion relations leads
to various non-trivial compatibility conditions on the spacetime structures
encoded by them. This permits us to formulate additional operational
assumptions under which the LMP singles out Lorentzian metric spacetimes within
generalized geometries defined by dispersion relations.

by position-dependent effective potentials have recently come under renewed
focus, in light of a remarkable set of experiments observing robust quantized
zero-bias conductance plateaus in semiconductor-superconductor
heterostructures. We show that (1) the partial spatial separation of the wave
functions of the component Majorana bound states (MBSs) is crucial for the
creation and stability of topologically trivial near-zero-energy Andreev bound
states, (2) the signs of the spin polarizations of the component MBSs can be
either the same or opposite, depending on the profile of the inducing
potential, and (3) the spin polarizations do not play a fundamental role in
generating vastly different coupling strengths to local probes and/or ensuring
the robustness of the near-zero-energy ABS. Consequently, in contrast to recent
theoretical claims (Vuik et al., arXiv:1806.02801), we find that a robust,
quantized zero-bias conductance plateau of height 2e^2/h measured in the
topologically trivial regime necessarily requires partially separated ABSs
(ps-ABSs), independent of the relative signs of the spin-polarizations. In
addition, we show that (4) well-defined energy splitting oscillations involve
MBSs characterized by exponential tails pointing toward each other, and (5)
ps-ABSs generated by the tunnel barrier itself produce zero-bias conductance
peaks with a characteristic width that increases strongly with the applied
magnetic field. Finally, we propose (6) a quantitative scheme for analyzing the
stability of Majorana modes based on probability distributions of splitting
susceptibilities and show that a ps-ABS mode can be remarkably robust when
judged based on its signature in a charge tunneling experiment, but, in
essence, is topologically unprotected.

symmetry of massless scattering amplitudes. The classical symmetry is
potentially broken at the quantum level by infrared and ultraviolet effects. We
study its manifestations on the finite hard part of the scattering process. The
conformal Ward identities in momentum space are second-order differential
equations, difficult to analyze. We prefer to study superconformal symmetry
whose generators are first-order in the momenta. Working in a massless N=1
supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model, we derive on-shell superconformal Ward
identities. They contain an anomaly due to collinear regions of loop momenta.
It is given by an integral with one loop less than the original graph, with an
extra integral over a collinear splitting parameter. We discuss the relation to
the holomorphic anomaly that was previously studied in tree-level amplitudes
and at the level of unitarity cuts. We derive and solve Ward identities for
various scattering processes in the model. We classify the on-shell
superamplitudes according to their Grassmann degree, in close analogy with the
helicity classification of gluon amplitudes. We focus on MHV-like and NMHV-like
amplitudes with up to six external particles, at one and two loops.
Interestingly, the superconformal generator acting on the bosonic part of the
amplitudes is Witten's twistor collinearity operator. We find that the
first-order differential equations, together with physically motivated boundary
conditions, uniquely fix the answer. All the cases considered give rise to
uniform weight functions. Our most interesting example is a five-point
non-planar hexa-box integral with an off-shell leg. It gives first indications

the AGN torus emission also for low-luminosity end, down to $\log

significant host galaxy contamination. We find that the luminosity contribution

function of the 14-150 keV luminosity. We also find that for the most extreme
cases, the IR pure-AGN emission from the torus can extend up to 90 $\mu$m. The
obtained total IR AGN luminosity through the IR SED decomposition enables us to
estimate the fraction of the sky obscured by dust, i.e., the dust covering

smaller than that of the X-ray obscuration fraction above the AGN bolometric
luminosity of $\log (L_{\rm bol}/{\rm erg}~{\rm s}^{-1}) \simeq 42.5$.
Considering that X-ray obscuration fraction is equivalent to the covering

halo properties in cold dark matter (CDM) and a self-interacting dark matter
(SIDM) scenario with a constant cross-section of
$\sigma^\text{T}/m_{\chi}=1\;\text{cm}^{2}\text{g}^{-1}$. We find that the
interplay between dark matter self-interaction and baryonic physics induces a
complex evolution of the halo properties, which depends on the halo mass and
morphological type, as well as on the halo mass accretion history. While high
mass haloes, selected as analogues of early-type galaxies, show cored profiles
in the SIDM run, systems of intermediate mass and with a significant disk
component can develop a profile that is similar or cuspier than in CDM. The
final properties of SIDM haloes - measured at z=0.2 - correlate with the halo
concentration and formation time, suggesting that the differences between
different systems are due to the fact that we are observing the impact
self-interaction. We also search for signatures of self-interacting dark matter
in the lensing signal of the main haloes and hints of potential differences in
the distribution of Einstein radii, which suggests that future wide-field
survey might be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM models on this basis.
Finally, we find that the subhalo abundances are not altered in the adopted
SIDM model with respect to CDM.

indications that this correlation may be stronger than the one between

intrinsic emission from the corona and accretion disk by the same structure. We
explore the resulting implications on the underlying distribution of covering
fraction for all AGNs, by generating mock observables for the reflection
parameter and IR luminosity ratio using empirical relations found for the
covering fraction with each quantity. We find that the observed distributions
of the reflection parameter and IR-to-X-ray ratio are reproduced with broad
distributions centered around covering fractions of at least ~40%-50%, whereas
narrower distributions match our observations only when centered around
covering fractions of ~70%-80%. Our results are consistent with both
independent estimates of the covering fractions of individual objects and the
typical covering fraction obtained on the basis of obscured fractions for
samples of AGNs. These results suggest that the level of reprocessing in AGNs,

the geometry of the obscuring material.

orbits have the property that they are not completely local, but depend on data
within a finite patch around the intersection, thereby forming an initial step
towards understanding global aspects of the distance conjecture in field
spaces. Our results follow from a deep mathematical structure captured by the
so-called orbit theorems, which gives a handle on singularities in the moduli
space through mixed Hodge structures, and is related to a local notion of
mirror symmetry thereby allowing us to apply it also to the large volume
setting. These theorems are general and apply far beyond Calabi-Yau moduli
spaces, leading us to propose that similarly the infinite distance structures

from both physicists and mathematicians. One of the most intriguing suggestions
to resolve the information paradox is due to Bekenstein, who has stressed the
fact that the low-energy part of the semi-classical black-hole emission
spectrum is partly blocked by the curvature potential that surrounds the black
hole. As explicitly shown by Bekenstein, this fact implies that the grey-body
emission spectrum of a (3+1)-dimensional black hole is considerably less
entropic than the corresponding radiation spectrum of a perfectly thermal
black-body emitter. Using standard ideas from quantum information theory, it
was shown by Bekenstein that, in principle, the filtered Hawking radiation
emitted by a (3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole may carry with it a
substantial amount of information, the information which was suspected to be
lost. It is of physical interest to test the general validity of the
""information leak"" scenario suggested by Bekenstein as a possible resolution to
the Hawking information puzzle. In the present paper we analyze the
semi-classical entropy emission properties of higher-dimensional black holes.
In particular, we provide evidence that the characteristic Hawking quanta of
$(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in the large $D\gg1$ regime are
almost unaffected by the spacetime curvature outside the black-hole horizon.
This fact implies that, in the large-$D$ regime, the Hawking black-hole
radiation spectra are almost purely thermal, thus suggesting that the emitted
quanta cannot carry the amount of information which is required in order to
resolve the information paradox. Our analysis therefore suggests that the
elegant information leak scenario suggested by Bekenstein cannot provide a
generic resolution to the intriguing Hawking information paradox.

temporal nonanalyticities in matrix elements of the time-evolution operator.
These transitions are not driven by an external control parameter, but rather

Because vortex excitations of the latter carry a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom
numbers, the SC order may be understood as emerging from a gapless spin liquid

is to find and characterize heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).
Based on mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys, we have
selected a large population of luminous obscured AGN (i.e., obscured quasars).
Here we report NuSTAR observations of four WISE-selected heavily obscured
quasars for which we have optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large
Telescope and W. M. Keck Observatory. Optical diagnostics confirm that all four
targets are AGNs. With NuSTAR hard X-ray observations, three of the four
objects are undetected, while the fourth has a marginal detection. We confirm
that these objects have observed hard X-ray (10-40 keV) luminosities at or
below ~ 10^43 erg s^-1. We compare X-ray and IR luminosities to obtain
estimates of the hydrogen column densities (N_H) based on the suppression of
the hard X-ray emission. We estimate N_H of these quasars to be at or larger
than 10^25 cm^-2, confirming that WISE and optical selection can identify very
heavily obscured quasars that may be missed in X-ray surveys, and do not
contribute significantly to the cosmic X-ray background. From the optical
Balmer decrements, we found that our three extreme obscured targets lie in
highly reddened host environments. This galactic extinction is not adequate to
explain the more obscured AGN, but it may imply a different scale of
obscuration in the galaxy.

hole (SMBH). Two processes that are commonly considered (e.g., for sub-grid
prescriptions) are Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and the Eddington limit. A
third one is AGN wind feedback. It has been long suggested that such a wind
feedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently
that AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level
consistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the
effect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution
hydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection
scheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are
explored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one
in which it has an isothermal sphere profile. We also compare simulations with
and without cooling. Our main finding is that for reasonable parameters, AGN
feedback always limits the accretion rate to be far below the
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton limit. For typical wind parameters and a uniform ISM
densities of the order $1 {cm}^{-3}$, the accretion rate is found to be several
orders of magnitudes smaller than that inferred in large samples of high
redshift AGNs. On the other hand, the accretion rate obtained for initially
isothermal density profile is found to be consistent with the observations,
particularly when cooling is included. Furthermore, it roughly scales as
$\sigma^{5}$ with the velocity dispersion of the bulge, in accord with the
$M-\sigma$ relation.

core energy sources resulting from core formation, its differentiation, its
solidification (latent heat), core contraction and radioactive decay. We divide
the evolution of the rocky core into three phases: the formation phase, which
sets the initial conditions, the magma ocean phase, characterized by rapid heat
transport, and the solid state phase, where cooling is inefficient. We find
that for typical sub-Neptune planets of ~2-10 Earth masses and envelope mass
fractions of 0.5-10% the magma ocean phase lasts several Gyrs, much longer than
for terrestrial planets. The magma ocean phase effectively erases any signs of
the initial core thermodynamic state. After solidification, the reduced heat
flux from the rocky core causes a significant drop in the rocky core surface
temperature, but its effect on the planet radius is limited. In the long run,
radioactive heating is the most significant core energy source in our model.
Overall, the long term radius uncertainty by core thermal effects is up to 15%.

This roughly $L*$ galaxy is a unique case where spatially resolved measurements
of the gas-phase and stellar metallicity, dust extinction, and neutral ISM gas
content are all available, enabling a census of the present metal mass. We
combine spatially resolved star formation histories from the Panchromatic
Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey with a metal production model to calculate the
history of metal production in M31. We find that $1.8\times10^9 \, M_\odot$ of
metals, or 62\% of the metal mass formed within $r < 19 \,\mathrm{kpc}$, is
missing from the disk in our fiducial model, implying that the M31 disk has
experienced significant gaseous outflows over its lifetime. Under a
conservative range of model assumptions, we find that between 3\% and 88\% of
metals have been lost ($1.9\times10^7 - 6.4\times10^9 \, M_\odot$), so metals
are missing even when all model parameters are chosen to favor metal retention.
We show that the missing metal mass could be harbored in M31's CGM if the
majority of the metals reside in a hot gas phase. Finally, we find that some
metal mass produced in the past 1.5 Gyr in the central $\sim5 \,\mathrm{kpc}$

learning proceeds continuously as the agent interacts with an environment. The
predictions made by the agent are contingent on a particular way of behaving,
represented as a value function. However, the behavior used to select actions
and generate the behavior data might be different from the one used to define
the predictions, and thus the samples are generated off-policy. The ability to
learn behavior-contingent predictions online and off-policy has long been
advocated as a key capability of predictive-knowledge learning systems but
remained an open algorithmic challenge for decades. The issue lies with the
temporal difference (TD) learning update at the heart of most prediction
algorithms: combining bootstrapping, off-policy sampling and function
approximation may cause the value estimate to diverge. A breakthrough came with
the development of a new objective function that admitted stochastic gradient
descent variants of TD. Since then, many sound online off-policy prediction
algorithms have been developed, but there has been limited empirical work
investigating the relative merits of all the variants. This paper aims to fill
these empirical gaps and provide clarity on the key ideas behind each method.
We summarize the large body of literature on off-policy learning, focusing on
1- methods that use computation linear in the number of features and are
convergent under off-policy sampling, and 2- other methods which have proven
useful with non-fixed, nonlinear function approximation. We provide an
empirical study of off-policy prediction methods in two challenging
microworlds. We report each method's parameter sensitivity, empirical
convergence rate, and final performance, providing new insights that should
enable practitioners to successfully extend these new methods to large-scale
applications.[Abridged abstract]

hierarchical structures. We explore this question with a well-formed bracket
prediction task using two types of brackets modeled by an LSTM. Demonstrating
that such a system is learnable by an LSTM is the first step in demonstrating
that the entire class of CFLs is also learnable. We observe that the model
requires exponential memory in terms of the number of characters and embedded
depth, where a sub-linear memory should suffice. Still, the model does more
than memorize the training input. It learns how to distinguish between relevant
and irrelevant information. On the other hand, we also observe that the model
does not generalize well. We conclude that LSTMs do not learn the relevant
underlying context-free rules, suggesting the good overall performance is
attained rather by an efficient way of evaluating nuisance variables. LSTMs are
a way to quickly reach good results for many natural language tasks, but to
understand and generate natural language one has to investigate other concepts

applications, each node is typically linked to only a small subset of other

cope with the resulting sparse networks. While low-dimensional network

network embedding methods focus primarily on single view networks. We introduce
a novel multi-view network embedding (MVNE) algorithm for constructing
low-dimensional node embeddings from multi-view networks. MVNE adapts and
extends an approach to single view network embedding (SVNE) using graph
factorization clustering (GFC) to the multi-view setting using an objective
function that maximizes the agreement between views based on both the local and
global structure of the underlying multi-view graph. Our experiments with
several benchmark real-world single view networks show that GFC-based SVNE
yields network embeddings that are competitive with or superior to those
produced by the state-of-the-art single view network embedding methods when the
embeddings are used for labeling unlabeled nodes in the networks. Our
experiments with several multi-view networks show that MVNE substantially
outperforms the single view methods on integrated view and the state-of-the-art
multi-view methods. We further show that even when the goal is to predict
labels of nodes within a single target view, MVNE outperforms its single-view
counterpart suggesting that the MVNE is able to extract the information that is
useful for labeling nodes in the target view from the all of the views.

desired category output. When the classifier represents more than one category,
it creates a new layer and splits, to represent each category separately in the

new levels when there is a split in the data, or when some data rows are
incorrectly classified. Each layer can therefore branch like a tree - not for

suggests further innovations, by adding fixed value ranges through bands, for
each column or feature of the input dataset. When considering features, it is
shown that some of the data can be classified directly through fixed value
ranges, while the rest can be classified using the classifier technique. Tests

from the need of additional subblocks, slow responses, and most importantly,
supporting only the even reflection symmetry operations for normal incidences,
working for a certain incident angle or polarization, and executing only single

that an ultra-compact, integrable and planar metasurface-assisted platform can
execute a variety of optical signal processing operations such as spatial
differentiation and integration. It is demonstrated that a metasurface
featuring non-reciprocal property can be thought of as a new paradigm to break
the even symmetry of reflection and perform both even- and odd-symmetry
mathematical operations at normal incidences. Numerical simulations also
illustrate different aspects of multichannel edge detection scheme through
projecting multiple images on the metasurface from different directions. Such

control. It reduces the complexity of engineering systems by mapping the

map often depends on the data analysts' knowledge and is largely ad hoc. In
this paper, we propose a tractable algorithm that estimates the probabilistic
aggregation map from the system's trajectory. We adopt a soft-aggregation
model, where each meta-state has a signature raw state, called an anchor state.
This model includes several common state aggregation models as special cases.
Our proposed method is a simple two-step algorithm: The first step is spectral
decomposition of empirical transition matrix, and the second step conducts a
linear transformation of singular vectors to find their approximate convex
hull. It outputs the aggregation distributions and disaggregation distributions
for each meta-state in explicit forms, which are not obtainable by classical
spectral methods. On the theoretical side, we prove sharp error bounds for
estimating the aggregation and disaggregation distributions and for identifying
anchor states. The analysis relies on a new entry-wise deviation bound for
singular vectors of the empirical transition matrix of a Markov process, which
is of independent interest and cannot be deduced from existing literature. The
application of our method to Manhattan traffic data successfully generates a

particular, the topological properties of the collective order-parameter

symmetries. The emergent continuity relations are thus robust against
structural imperfections and anisotropies, which would be detrimental to the
conventional spin currents (that rely on approximate spin-rotational
symmetries). The underlying fluxes thus supersede the notion of spin flow in
insulators, setting the stage for nonequilibrium phenomena termed topological
hydrodynamics. Here, we outline our current understanding of the essential
ingredients, based on the energetics of the electrically-controlled injection
of topological flows through interfaces, along with a reciprocal signal
generation by the outflow of the conserved quantity. We will focus on two

arms race between new defenses and attacks. The most promising defenses,

such weaknesses by developing a new attack based on interval gradients. By
contrast, verifiably robust training provides protection against any L-p
norm-bounded attacker but incurs orders of magnitude more computational and
memory overhead than adversarially robust training.
  We propose two novel techniques, stochastic robust approximation and dynamic
mixed training, to drastically improve the efficiency of verifiably robust
training without sacrificing verified robustness. We leverage two critical
insights: (1) instead of over the entire training set, sound
over-approximations over randomly subsampled training data points are
sufficient for efficiently guiding the robust training process; and (2) We
observe that the test accuracy and verifiable robustness often conflict after

is a great way for designers to convey a specific look and feel. Unfortunately,
there is no existing solution to help model structurally sound aggregates. The
challenges stem from the fact that the final shape and its structural
properties emerge from the arrangements of the elements, whose sizes are large
so that they remain easily identifiable. Therefore there is a very tight
coupling between the object shape, structural properties, and the precise
layout of the elements.
  We present the first method to create aggregates of elements that are
structurally sound and can be manufactured on 3D printers. Rather than having
to assemble an aggregate shape by painstakingly positioning elements one by
one, users of our method only have to describe the structural purpose of the
desired object. This is done by specifying a set of external forces and
attachment points. The algorithm then automatically optimizes a layout of
user-provided elements that answers the specified scenario. The elements can
have arbitrary shapes: convex, concave, elongated, and can be allowed to
deform.
  Our approach creates connections between elements through small overlaps
preserving their appearance, while optimizing for the global rigidity of the
resulting aggregate. We formulate a topology optimization problem whose design
variables are the positions and orientations of individual elements. Global
rigidity is maximized through a dedicated gradient descent scheme. Due to the
challenging setting -- number of elements, arbitrary shapes, orientation, and
constraints in 3D -- we propose several novel steps to achieve convergence.

spatial stiffness modulation. The modulation is defined by the sampling of a
two-dimensional surface, which provides the lattices with topological
properties that are usually attributed to two-dimensional crystals. We show
that the cyclic variation of the phase of the stiffness modulation leads to a
Berry phase accumulation for the Bloch eigenmodes, which is characterized by
integer valued Chern numbers for the bands and associated gap labels. The
resulting non-trivial gaps are spanned by edge modes localized at one of the
boundaries of the considered 1D lattices. The edge mode location is governed by
the phase of the stiffness distribution, whose spatial modulation drives these
modes to transition from one edge to the other, through a bulk state that
occurs when the corresponding dispersion branch touches the bulk bands. This
property enables the implementation of a topological pump that is obtained by
stacking and coupling a family of modulated 1D lattices along a second spatial
dimension. The gradual variation of the stiffness phase modulation drives the
adiabatic transition of the edge states, which transition from their localized
state at one boundary, to a bulk mode and, finally, to another localized state
at the opposite boundary. Similar effects were illustrated under the assumption
of quasiperiodic modulation of the lattice interactions. We here demonstrate
that a topological pump can be achieved also in periodic media, and illustrate
this for the first time in elastic discrete lattices.

for the Moore-Read Pfaffian is a purely three-body model that breaks
particle-hole symmetry and lacks other properties, such as dominate two-body
repulsive interactions, expected from a physical model of the FQHE. We use
exact diagonalization to study the low energy states of a more physical
two-body generator model derived from the three-body model. We find that the
two-body model exhibits the essential features expected from the Moore-Read
Pfaffian: pairing, non-Abelian anyon excitations, and a neutral fermion mode.
The model also satisfies constraints expected for a physical model of the FQHE
at half-filling because it is: short range, spatially decaying, particle-hole
symmetric, and supports a roton mode with a robust spectral gap in the
thermodynamic limit. Hence, this two-body model offers a bridge between
artificial three-body generator models for paired states and the physical
Coulomb interaction and can be used to further explore properties of
non-Abelian physics in the FQHE.

timescales much shorter than the age of the Solar System. Thus one or more
ongoing processes probably maintain its brightness. Eris is predicted to have a
primarily nitrogen atmosphere that is in vapor pressure equilibrium with
nitrogen-ice and is collisional (not ballistic). Eris's eccentric orbit is
expected to result in two atmospheric regimes: (1) a period near perihelion
when the atmosphere is global (analogous to the atmospheres of Mars, Triton,
and Pluto) and (2) a period near aphelion when only a local atmosphere exists
near the warmest region (analogous to the atmosphere of Io). A numerical model
developed to simulate Eris's thermal and volatile evolution in the local
atmosphere regime is presented. The model conserves energy, mass, and momentum
while maintaining vapor pressure equilibrium. It is adaptable to other local,
collisional, sublimation atmospheres, which in addition to Io and Eris, may
occur on several volatile-bearing KBOs. The model was applied for a limiting
case where Eris is fixed at aphelion and has an initial nitrogen-ice mass
everywhere equal to the precipitable column of nitrogen in Pluto's atmosphere
during the New Horizons encounter (the resultant mass if the Pluto atmosphere
collapsed uniformly onto the surface). The model results indicate that (1)
transport of nitrogen in the local, collisional, sublimation atmosphere regime
is significant, (2) changes of Eris's albedo or color from nitrogen transport

important changes in the structure of interstellar clouds, and marks the
beginning of interstellar chemistry. Because of the relatively simple networks
controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the
underlying physical conditions including for instance the fraction of gas in
molecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three
possible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO+, HOC+, and CF+.
We presented high sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact
HII regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground
state transitions of the molecular ions HCO+, HOC+, and CF+ and the neutral
species HCN and HNC, and from the excited state transitions of C3H+(4-3) and
13CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the
ground state transition of HF and p-H2O. We show that the HCO+, HOC+, and CF+
column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO+ and HOC+ are tightly
correlated with p-H2O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with
HF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or
in the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C3H+ confirming that
this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H2
of ~7E-11. We confirm that the CF+ abundance is lower than predicted by simple
chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is
lower by a factor of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF

to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative to H2 of

multi-flow in graphs has been studied extensively. For general graphs with $k$
terminal pairs, the flow-cut gap is $O(\log k)$, and this is tight. But when
topological restrictions are placed on the flow network, the situation is far
less clear. In particular, it has been conjectured that the flow-cut gap in
planar networks is $O(1)$, while the known bounds place the gap somewhere
between $2$ (Lee and Raghavendra, 2003) and $O(\sqrt{\log k})$ (Rao, 1999).
  A seminal result of Okamura and Seymour (1981) shows that when all the
terminals of a planar network lie on a single face, the flow-cut gap is exactly
$1$. This setting can be generalized by considering planar networks where the
terminals lie on $\gamma>1$ faces in some fixed planar drawing. Lee and
Sidiropoulos (2009) proved that the flow-cut gap is bounded by a function of
$\gamma$, and Chekuri, Shepherd, and Weibel (2013) showed that the gap is at
most $3\gamma$. We prove that the flow-cut gap is $O(\log\gamma)$, by showing
that the edge-weighted shortest-path metric induced on the terminals admits a
stochastic embedding into trees with distortion $O(\log\gamma)$, which is
tight.
  The preceding results refer to the setting of edge-capacitated networks. For
vertex-capacitated networks, it can be significantly more challenging to
control flow-cut gaps. While there is no exact vertex-capacitated version of
the Okamura-Seymour Theorem, an approximate version holds; Lee, Mendel, and
Moharrami (2015) showed that the vertex-capacitated flow-cut gap is $O(1)$ on
planar networks whose terminals lie on a single face. We prove that the
flow-cut gap is $O(\gamma)$ for vertex-capacitated instances when the terminals
lie on at most $\gamma$ faces. In fact, this result holds in the more general
setting of submodular vertex capacities.

imaging of cardiovascular diseases. Full coverage of the left ventricle (LV),
from base to apex, is a basic criterion for CMR image quality and necessary for
accurate measurement of cardiac volume and functional assessment. Incomplete
coverage of the LV is identified through visual inspection, which is
time-consuming and usually done retrospectively in the assessment of large
imaging cohorts. This paper proposes a novel automatic method for determining
LV coverage from CMR images by using Fisher-discriminative three-dimensional
(FD3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast to our previous method
employing 2D CNNs, this approach utilizes spatial contextual information in CMR
volumes, extracts more representative high-level features and enhances the
discriminative capacity of the baseline 2D CNN learning framework, thus
achieving superior detection accuracy. A two-stage framework is proposed to
identify missing basal and apical slices in measurements of CMR volume. First,
the FD3D CNN extracts high-level features from the CMR stacks. These image
representations are then used to detect the missing basal and apical slices.
Compared to the traditional 3D CNN strategy, the proposed FD3D CNN minimizes
within-class scatter and maximizes between-class scatter. We performed
extensive experiments to validate the proposed method on more than 5,000
independent volumetric CMR scans from the UK Biobank study, achieving low error
rates for missing basal/apical slice detection (4.9\%/4.6\%). The proposed
method can also be adopted for assessing LV coverage for other types of CMR
image data.

convergence properties, but computing the Hessian matrix for large-scale
problems is not practical. Quasi-Newton methods require only first-order
gradient information, like SGD, but they can construct a low rank approximation
of the Hessian matrix and result in superlinear convergence. The limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) approach is one of the most popular
quasi-Newton methods that construct positive definite Hessian approximations.
In this paper, we introduce an efficient optimization method, based on the
limited memory BFGS quasi-Newton method using line search strategy -- as an
alternative to SGD methods. Our method bridges the disparity between first
order methods and second order methods by continuing to use gradient
information to calculate a low-rank Hessian approximations. We provide formal
convergence analysis as well as empirical results on a subset of the classic
ATARI 2600 games. Our results show a robust convergence with preferred
generalization characteristics, as well as fast training time and no need for
the experience replaying mechanism.

denoising/decomposition method, DeepDenoiser, based on a deep neural network.
This network is able to learn simultaneously a sparse representation of data in
the time-frequency domain and a non-linear function that maps this
representation into masks that decompose input data into a signal of interest

achieves impressive denoising of seismic signals even when the signal and noise
share a common frequency band. Our method properly handles a variety of colored
noise and non-earthquake signals. DeepDenoiser can significantly improve the
SNR with minimal changes in the waveform shape of interest, even in presence of
high noise levels. We demonstrate the effect of our method on improving
earthquake detection. There are clear applications of DeepDenoiser to seismic
imaging, micro-seismic monitoring, and preprocessing of ambient noise data. We
also note that potential applications of our approach are not limited to these

whole as a combination of elements, is desirable across disciplines. This
workshop bring together researchers applying compositional approaches to
physics, NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. Within NLP, a long-standing
aim is to represent how words can combine to form phrases and sentences. Within
the framework of distributional semantics, words are represented as vectors in
vector spaces. The categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010], inspired by
quantum protocols, has provided a convincing account of compositionality in
vector space models of NLP. There is furthermore a history of vector space
models in cognitive science. Theories of categorization such as those developed
by Nosofsky [1986] and Smith et al. [1988] utilise notions of distance between
feature vectors. More recently G\""ardenfors [2004, 2014] has developed a model
of concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and
information is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector spaces. The
same compositional approach has been applied to this formalism, giving
conceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously
[Bolt et al., 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the
study of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game
theory, where games are studied monolithically as one global object,
compositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games
from smaller components. Such an approach is inherently difficult since the
interaction between games has to be considered. Research into categorical
compositional methods for this field have recently begun [Ghani et al., 2018].
Moreover, the interaction between the three disciplines of cognitive science,
linguistics and game theory is a fertile ground for research. Game theory in
cognitive science is a well-established area [Camerer, 2011]. Similarly game
theoretic approaches have been applied in linguistics [J\""ager, 2008]. Lastly,
the study of linguistics and cognitive science is intimately intertwined
[Smolensky and Legendre, 2006, Jackendoff, 2007]. Physics supplies
compositional approaches via vector spaces and categorical quantum theory,
allowing the interplay between the three disciplines to be examined.

propagate this property along the Euler dynamic via an appropriate control of

smooth elsewhere, Yudovich solutions fail to be almost Lipschitz only near

vorticity to remain constant there. We show that if the vorticity is initially
constant near the whole boundary, then it remains such forever (and global weak

present the Photonic Recurrent Ising Sampler (PRIS), a heuristic method
tailored for parallel architectures that allows for fast and efficient sampling
from distributions of combinatorially hard Ising problems. Since the PRIS
relies essentially on vector-to-fixed matrix multiplications, we suggest the
implementation of the PRIS in photonic parallel networks, which realize these
operations at an unprecedented speed. The PRIS provides sample solutions to the
ground state of arbitrary Ising models, by converging in probability to their
associated Gibbs distribution. By running the PRIS at various noise levels, we
probe the critical behavior of universality classes and their critical
exponents. In addition to the attractive features of photonic networks, the
PRIS relies on intrinsic dynamic noise and eigenvalue dropout to find ground
states more efficiently. Our work suggests speedups in heuristic methods via
photonic implementations of the PRIS. We also hint at a broader class of
(meta)heuristic algorithms derived from the PRIS, such as combined simulated
annealing on the noise and eigenvalue dropout levels. Our algorithm can also be
implemented in a competitive manner on fast parallel electronic hardware, such

polarization-encoded multiphoton systems. Our analyzer is based on two
single-photon quantum-nondemolition detectors, where each of them is
implemented with a four-level emitter (e.g., a quantum dot) coupled to a
one-dimensional system (such as a micropillar cavity or a photonic nanocrystal
waveguide). The analyzer works in a passive way and can completely distinguish
$2^n$ Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger~(GHZ) states of $n$ photons without using any
active operation or fast switching. The efficiency and fidelity of the
GHZ-state analysis can, in principle, be close to unity, when an ideal
single-photon scattering condition is fulfilled. For a nonideal scattering,
which typically reduces the fidelity of a GHZ-state analysis, we introduce a
passively error-rejecting circuit to enable a near-perfect fidelity at the
expense of a slight decrease of its efficiency. Furthermore, the protocol can
be directly used to perform a two-photon Bell-state analysis. This passive,
resource-efficient, and error-rejecting protocol can, therefore, be useful for
practical quantum networks.

arbitrary, but the relations between them, the arity shapes, are to be found
from some natural conditions (""arity freedom principle""). In this way,
generalized associative algebras, coassociative coalgebras, bialgebras and Hopf
algebras are defined and investigated. They have many unusual features in
comparison with the binary case. For instance, both the algebra and its
underlying field can be zeroless and nonunital, the existence of the unit and
counit is not obligatory, and the dimension of the algebra is not arbitrary,
but ""quantized"". The polyadic convolution product and bialgebra can be defined,
and when the algebra and coalgebra have unequal arities, the polyadic version
of the antipode, the querantipode, has different properties. As a possible
application to quantum group theory, we introduce the polyadic version of
braidings, almost co-commutativity, quasitriangularity and the equations for
the $R$-matrix (which can be treated as a polyadic analog of the Yang-Baxter
equation). Finally, we propose another concept of deformation which is governed
not by the twist map, but by the medial map, where only the latter is unique in
the polyadic case. We present the corresponding braidings, almost co-mediality
and $M$-matrix, for which the compatibility equations are found.

when the inter-component attraction is much stronger than the effective

of Gross-Pitaevskii equations for a binary Bose-Einstein condensate including
the SOC effect. We show that the model gives rise to two-dimensional quiescent

of the mixed-mode type (which feature mixtures of zero-vorticity and vortical

(with the vorticity carried by one component) are unstable. Due to breaking of
the Galilean invariance by SOC, the system supports moving solitons with
velocities up to a specific critical value. Collisions between moving solitons
are briefly considered too. The collisions lead, in particular, to a
quasi-elastic rebound, or an inelastic outcome, which features partial merger

wide range of applications, such as analysing high dimensional sensor data or

clusters in non-disjoint subspaces and scaling to large data, which impinge
their applicability in areas such as bioinformatics and the Internet of Things.
We aim to address such limitations by proposing a subspace clustering algorithm
using a bottom-up strategy. Our algorithm first searches for base clusters in
low dimensional subspaces. It then forms clusters in higher-dimensional
subspaces using these base clusters, which we formulate as a frequent pattern
mining problem. This formulation enables efficient search for clusters in
higher-dimensional subspaces, which is done using FP-trees. The proposed
algorithm is evaluated against traditional bottom-up clustering algorithms and
state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms. The experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm produces clusters with high accuracy, and scales
well to large volumes of data. We also demonstrate the algorithm's performance

model unobserved heterogeneity, which plays major roles in labor economics,
industrial organization and other fields. Mixtures are also convenient in
dealing with contaminated sampling models and models with multiple equilibria.
This paper shows that finite mixture models are nonparametrically identified
under weak assumptions that are plausible in economic applications. The key is
to utilize the identification power implied by information in covariates
variation. First, three identification approaches are presented, under distinct
and non-nested sets of sufficient conditions. Observable features of data
inform us which of the three approaches is valid. These results apply to
general nonparametric switching regressions, as well as to structural
econometric models, such as auction models with unobserved heterogeneity.
Second, some extensions of the identification results are developed. In
particular, a mixture regression where the mixing weights depend on the value
of the regressors in a fully unrestricted manner is shown to be
nonparametrically identifiable. This means a finite mixture model with
function-valued unobserved heterogeneity can be identified in a cross-section
setting, without restricting the dependence pattern between the regressor and
the unobserved heterogeneity. In this aspect it is akin to fixed effects panel
data models which permit unrestricted correlation between unobserved
heterogeneity and covariates. Third, the paper shows that fully nonparametric
estimation of the entire mixture model is possible, by forming a sample
analogue of one of the new identification strategies. The estimator is shown to
possess a desirable polynomial rate of convergence as in a standard
nonparametric estimation problem, despite nonregular features of the model.

spatial selectivity and variable ultrafast switching of terahertz waves,
respectively. These multifaceted response of phase change material can be used
in tandem with metamaterial that enables strong field confinement along with
on-demand spectral response and frequency selectivity. The unique and
multifarious properties of GST combined with the versatility and scalability of
metamaterial design and ease of fabrication could aid in the development of
advanced devices operating in terahertz range, such as spatio-temporal light
modulators, neuromorphic photonic devices, compressive imagers, and switchable
holograms, vital for the next generation wireless communication systems.

young clustered population embedded in a large population of field stars, with
no prior knowledge on the nature of stars in the field. We conducted our blind
test study on the NGC 2264 region, which hosts a well-known young cluster. We
selected a large (4 sq. deg.) area around the NGC 2264 cluster, and assembled
an extensive r,i,J catalog of the field from pre-existing large-scale surveys.
We then mapped the stellar color locus on the (i-J, r-i) diagram to select
M-type stars, which: i) comprise a significant fraction of the Galactic stellar
population; ii) exhibit the strongest luminosity evolution from the PMS to the
MS; iii) have r,i,J color properties that provide a direct and empirical
estimate of A_V. A comparative analysis of the photometric and spatial
properties of M-type stars as a function of A_V enabled us to probe the
structure and stellar content of our field. We could identify two distinct
populations: a diffuse field population and a clustered population. The
presence of occulting material, spatially associated with the clustered
population, allowed us to derive an estimate of its distance (800-900 pc) and
age (~0.5-5 Myr), consistent with the literature parameters for the NGC 2264
star-forming region. The extracted clustered population exhibits a hierarchical
structure, in excellent agreement with the NGC 2264 subregions reported in the

census of the NGC 2264 cluster for about 95% of the objects in the inner
regions of the field, where the contamination rate by field stars in our sample
is only 2%. The method tested here can be readily applied to surveys like
Pan-STARRS and the future LSST to undertake a first complete census of

for describing the phenomenon in a manner that accounts for the atomistic
configuration of the interface and the exact bulk phonon dispersion. Building
on the atomistic Green's function (AGF) technique for ballistic phonon
transport, we formulate an atomistic S-matrix method that treats bulk phonon
modes as the scattering channels and can determine the numerically exact
scattering amplitudes for individual two-phonon processes, enabling a highly
detailed analysis of the phonon transmission and reflection spectrum as well as
the directional dependence of the phonon scattering specularity. Explicit
formulas for the individual phonon reflection, absorption and transmission
coefficients are given in our formulation. This AGF-based S-matrix approach is
illustrated through the investigation of: (1) phonon scattering at the junction
between two isotopically different but structurally identical carbon nanotubes,
and (2) phonon boundary scattering at the zigzag and armchair edges in
graphene. In particular, we uncover the role of edge chirality on phonon
scattering specularity and explain why specularity is reduced for the ideal
armchair edge. The application of the method can shed new light on the

employ S3-GAN to build mappings between the manifold and a latent vector space
for separating and synthesizing the contents and styles. The S3-GAN consists of
an encoder network, a generator network, and an adversarial network. The
encoder network performs style separation by mapping an object photograph to a
latent vector. Two halves of the latent vector represent the content and style,
respectively. The generator network performs style synthesis by taking a
concatenated vector as input. The concatenated vector contains the style half
vector of the style target image and the content half vector of the content
target image. Once obtaining the images from the generator network, an
adversarial network is imposed to generate more photo-realistic images.
Experiments on CelebA and UT Zappos 50K datasets demonstrate that the S3-GAN
has the capacity of style separation and synthesis simultaneously, and could

expansion rate; constraining possible deviations from General Relativity on
cosmological scales by measuring the growth rate of structure through multiple
independent methods; mapping the structure of the Universe on the largest
accessible scales, thus constraining fundamental properties such as isotropy,
homogeneity, and non-Gaussianity; and measuring the HI density and bias out to

lensing measurements that have independent systematic uncertainties to those of

software technologies for different computing environments. As the result,
computing systems can be seen as integrated system of hardware and software
systems. Realizing such complex systems is crucial for providing safety,
security, and maintenance. This is while the characterization of computing
systems is not possible without a systematic procedure for enumerating
different components and their structural/behavioral relationships.
Architecture Reconstruction (AR) is a practice defined in the domain of
software engineering for the realization of a specific software component.
However, it is not applicable to a whole system (including HW/SW). Inspired by
Symphony AR framework, we have proposed a generalized method to reconstruct the
architecture of a computing platform at HW/SW boundary. In order to cover
diverge set of existing HW/SW technologies, our method uses an ontology-based
approach to handle these complexities. Due to the lack of a comprehensive
accurate ontology in the literature, we have developed our own ontology --
called PLATOnt -- which is shown to be more effective by ONTOQA evaluation
framework. We have used our AR method in two use case scenarios to reconstruct
the architecture of ARM-based Trusted execution environment and a Raspberry-pi
platform have extensive application in embedded systems and IoT devices.

opto-acoustic interaction in such periodic structures, and find forward
intramodal-SBS gains up to $1750~\text{m}^{-1}\text{W}^{-1}$, which compares
favorably with the proposed MIR SBS designs based on buried germanium
waveguides. This large gain is achieved thanks to the nearly complete

longitudinal changes in mood within subjects. A total of 153 participants
consented to taking part, with 38 participants completing the required number

analysis revealed that several linguistic features, including tentativeness and
non-fluencies, were significantly associated with depression and anxiety
symptoms, but not suicidal thoughts. Within-subject analysis showed no robust
correlations between linguistic features and changes in mental health score.
This study provides further support for the relationship between linguistic
features within social media data and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The
lack of robust within-subject correlations indicate that the relationship

multiply scattered wave. However, these gating methods are imperfect as they
all act on the detection plane located outside a scattering medium. Here, we
present a new gating scheme, called 'space' gating, that rejects the multiply
scattered wave directly at the object plane inside a scattering medium.
Specifically, we introduced a 30 $\mu$m-wide acoustic focus to the object plane
and reconstructed a coherent image only with the ballistic wave modulated by
acousto-optic interaction. This method allows us to reject the multiply
scattered wave that the existing gating methods cannot filter out and improves
the ratio of the ballistic wave to the multiply scattered wave by more than 100
times for a scattering medium more than 20 times thicker than its scattering
mean free path. Using the coherent imaging technique based on space gating, we
demonstrate the unprecedented imaging capability - phase imaging of optically
transparent biological cells fully embedded within a scattering medium - with a

  In the context of streaming with random edge arrivals, our techniques yield a

For multi-pass streaming and the MPC model, we show that any algorithm
computing a $(1-\delta)$-approximate unweighted matching in bipartite graphs
can be translated into an algorithm that computes a
$(1-\varepsilon(\delta))$-approximate maximum weighted matching. Furthermore,
this translation incurs only a constant factor (that depends on $\varepsilon>
0$) overhead in the complexity. Instantiating this with the current best
multi-pass streaming and MPC algorithms for unweighted matchings yields the
following results for maximum weighted matchings:
  * A $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation streaming algorithm that uses
$O_\varepsilon(1)$ passes and $O_\varepsilon(n\, \text{poly} (\log n))$ memory.
This is the first $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation streaming algorithm for
weighted matchings that uses a constant number of passes (only depending on

$O_\varepsilon(\log \log n)$ rounds, $O(m/n)$ machines per round, and

Interest (ROI) with a team of aerial robots. The size and shape of the ROI are
unknown to the robots. The objective is to find a tour for each robot such that
each point in the ROI must be visible from the field-of-view of some robot
along its tour. In conventional exploration using ground robots, the ROI
boundary is typically also as an obstacle and robots are naturally constrained
to the interior of this ROI. Instead, we study the case where aerial robots are
not restricted to flying inside the ROI (and can fly over the boundary of the
ROI).
  We propose a recursive depth-first search-based algorithm that yields a
constant competitive ratio for the exploration problem. Our analysis also
extends to the case where the ROI is translating, \eg, in the case of marine
plumes. In the simpler version of the problem where the ROI is modeled as a 2D
grid, the competitive ratio is
$\frac{2(S_r+S_p)(R+\lfloor\log{R}\rfloor)}{(S_r-S_p)(1+\lfloor\log{R}\rfloor)}$
where $R$ is the number of robots, and $S_r$ and $S_p$ are the robot speed and
the ROI speed, respectively. We also consider a more realistic scenario where
the ROI shape is not restricted to grid cells but an arbitrary shape. We show
our algorithm has
$\frac{2(S_r+S_p)(18R+\lfloor\log{R}\rfloor)}{(S_r-S_p)(1+\lfloor\log{R}\rfloor)}$
competitive ratio under some conditions. We empirically verify our algorithm
using simulations as well as a proof-of-concept experiment mapping a 2D ROI
using an aerial robot with a downwards-facing camera.

latitudes ($|b| \le 10.0^{\rm o}$, called Zone of Avoidance) which is complete
to a Galactic extinction-corrected magnitude of $K^o_s \le 11.25^{\rm m}$. It
also includes galaxies in regions of high foreground extinctions ($E(B-V) >
0.95^{\rm m}$) situated at higher latitudes. This catalogue forms the basis of
studies of large-scale structures, flow fields and extinction across the ZoA
and complements the ongoing 2MASS Redshift and Tully-Fisher surveys. It
comprises 3763 galaxies, 70% of which have at least one radial velocity
measurement in the literature. The catalogue is complete up to star density
levels of $\log N_*/{\rm deg}^2 <4.5$ and at least for $A_K < 0.6^{\rm m}$ and
likely as high as $A_K = 20^{\rm m}$. Thus the ZoA in terms of bright NIR
galaxies covers only $2.5-4$% of the whole sky. We use a diameter-dependent
extinction correction to compare our sample with an unobscured, high-latitude
sample. While the correction to the $K_s$ -band magnitude is sufficient, the
corrected diameters are too small by about $4''$ on average. The omission of
applying such a diameter-dependent extinction correction may lead to a biased
flow field even at intermediate extinction values as found in the 2MRS survey.
A slight dependence of galaxy colour with stellar density indicates that
unsubtracted foreground stars make galaxies appear bluer. Furthermore,
far-infrared sources in the DIRBE/IRAS extinction maps that were not removed at
low latitudes affect the foreground extinction corrections of three galaxies
and may weakly affect a further estimated $\approx 20$% of our galaxies.

attractive because all following processing will be easier and more efficient,
for example modeling, classifying or indexing. Audio Word2Vec previously
proposed was shown to be able to represent audio segments for spoken words as
such vectors carrying information about the phonetic structures of the signal
segments. However, each linguistic unit (word, syllable, phoneme in text form)
corresponds to unlimited number of audio segments with vector representations
inevitably spread over the embedding space, which causes some confusion. It is
therefore desired to better cluster the audio embeddings such that those
corresponding to the same linguistic unit can be more compactly distributed. In
this paper, inspired by Siamese networks, we propose some approaches to achieve
the above goal. This includes identifying positive and negative pairs from
unlabeled data for Siamese style training, disentangling acoustic factors such
as speaker characteristics from the audio embedding, handling unbalanced data
distribution, and having the embedding processes learn from the adjacency
relationships among data points. All these can be done in an unsupervised way.
Improved performance was obtained in preliminary experiments on the LibriSpeech
data set, including clustering characteristics analysis and applications of
spoken term detection.

consequence of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics (QM), and we also
assume that the uncertainty associated with a given hypothesis is a consequence
of the propagation of the imprecision through the inferential circuits of RBSs.
This article does not intend to contribute anything new to the QM field: it is
a work of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses QC techniques to solve the
problem of uncertainty in RBSs. Bearing the above arguments in mind a quantum
model is proposed. This model has been applied to a problem already defined by
one of the authors of this work in a previous publication and which is briefly
described in this article. Then the model is generalized, and it is thoroughly
evaluated. The results obtained show that QC is a valid, effective and

descriptions of elevation angle and color. We find that their locations were
36.5 deg ILAT on August 28/29 and 32.7 deg ILAT on September 1/2, suggesting
that trapped electrons moved to, at least, L~1.55 and L~1.41, respectively. The
equatorward boundary of ""purely red emission"" was likely located at 30.8 deg
ILAT on September 1/2. If ""purely red emission"" was a stable auroral red arc,
it would suggest that trapped protons moved to, at least, L~1.36. This
reconstruction with observed auroral emission regions provides conservative
estimations of magnetic storm intensities. We compare the auroral records with
magnetic observations. We confirm that multiple magnetic storms occurred during
this stormy interval, and that the equatorward expansion of the auroral oval is
consistent with the timing of magnetic disturbances. It is possible that the

operators. However, its efficiency requires sophisticated control mechanisms.
The more context information is used by it, the higher performance of networks
is expected. A facility for collecting this information, processing it and
controlling base stations managed by various network operators is a so-called
Radio Environment Map (REM) subsystem. This paper proposes REM-based schemes
for the allocation of base stations power levels in 4G/5G networks, while
considering interference generated to a licensed network. It is assumed that
both networks have different profiles of served users, e.g., area of their
positions and movement, which opens opportunities for spectrum sharing. The
proposed schemes have been evaluated by means of extensive system-level
simulations and compared with two widely adopted policy-based spectrum sharing
reference schemes. Simulation results show that dynamic schemes utilizing rich
context information, outperforms static, policy-based spectrum sharing schemes.

manipulation tasks by addressing shortcomings of Reinforcement Learning such as
exploration and reward specification. However, research in this area has been
limited to modest-sized datasets due to the difficulty of collecting large
quantities of task demonstrations through existing mechanisms. This work
introduces RoboTurk to address this challenge. RoboTurk is a crowdsourcing
platform for high quality 6-DoF trajectory based teleoperation through the use
of widely available mobile devices (e.g. iPhone). We evaluate RoboTurk on three
manipulation tasks of varying timescales (15-120s) and observe that our user
interface is statistically similar to special purpose hardware such as virtual
reality controllers in terms of task completion times. Furthermore, we observe
that poor network conditions, such as low bandwidth and high delay links, do
not substantially affect the remote users' ability to perform task
demonstrations successfully on RoboTurk. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of
RoboTurk through the collection of a pilot dataset; using RoboTurk, we
collected 137.5 hours of manipulation data from remote workers, amounting to
over 2200 successful task demonstrations in 22 hours of total system usage. We
show that the data obtained through RoboTurk enables policy learning on
multi-step manipulation tasks with sparse rewards and that using larger
quantities of demonstrations during policy learning provides benefits in terms
of both learning consistency and final performance. For additional results,

the realm of academy. previous network models contain two parts: (1) generating

Properties in these models, however, cannot be interpreted to concept in
prevalent social theories or empirical truth. Also, they usually treat everyone
in an uniform fashion. While such assumption is quite misguiding, and thus
saliently limits their performance. To overcome these flaws, we devise a
personalized evolving model for social network and opinion (PENO), where
citizens' ideology is revealed by variable opinions and four dimensions of
personality are considered for each entity - leadership, openness,
agreeableness, and neuroticism. Opinion propagates via social tie, tie
generates from opinion affinity, and personalities integrally work with opinion
and tie across evolution. To our best knowledge, PENO is the first attempt to
introduce personality impact in network dynamics and verify social science with
reasonable visualization during simulation. We also present its probabilistic
graph and conceive iterative learning algorithm. Experiments show PENO
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines over two typical prediction

but challenging task and finds many applications in different fields such as
urban planning, navigation and so on. This paper addresses the problem of
buildings extraction in very high-spatial-resolution (VHSR) remote sensing (RS)
images, whose spatial resolution is often up to half meters and provides rich
information about buildings. Based on the observation that buildings in VHSR-RS
images are always more distinguishable in geometry than in texture or spectral
domain, this paper proposes a geometric building index (GBI) for accurate
building extraction, by computing the geometric saliency from VHSR-RS images.
More precisely, given an image, the geometric saliency is derived from a
mid-level geometric representations based on meaningful junctions that can
locally describe geometrical structures of images. The resulting GBI is finally
measured by integrating the derived geometric saliency of buildings.
Experiments on three public and commonly used datasets demonstrate that the
proposed GBI achieves the state-of-the-art performance and shows impressive
generalization capability. Additionally, GBI preserves both the exact position
and accurate shape of single buildings compared to existing methods.

Disease (CAD) imaging. Detection of the end-diastolic frame (EDF) and, in

angiography acquisition is of significant importance for the anatomical and
non-invasive functional assessment of CAD. This task is generally performed via
manual frame selection or semi-automated selection based on simultaneously
acquired ECG signals - thus introducing the requirement of simultaneous ECG
recordings. We evaluate the performance of a purely image based workflow based
on deep neural networks for fully automated cardiac phase and EDF detection on
coronary angiographies. A first deep neural network (DNN), trained to detect
coronary arteries, is employed to preselect a subset of frames in which
coronary arteries are well visible. A second DNN predicts cardiac phase labels
for each frame. Only in the training and evaluation phases for the second DNN,
ECG signals are used to provide ground truth labels for each angiographic
frame. The networks were trained on 17800 coronary angiographies from 3900
patients and evaluated on 27900 coronary angiographies from 6250 patients. No
exclusion criteria related to patient state, previous interventions, or
pathology were formulated. Cardiac phase detection had an accuracy of 97.6%, a
sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 97.5% on the evaluation set. EDF
prediction had a precision of 97.4% and a recall of 96.9%. Several sub-group
analyses were performed, indicating that the cardiac phase detection
performance is largely independent from acquisition angles and the heart rate
of the patient. The average execution time of cardiac phase detection for one
angiographic series was on average less than five seconds on a standard
workstation.

arrays of atomic spins coupled via the ubiquitous Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
(RKKY) interaction, focusing on its two anisotropic parts: the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and the symmetric anisotropic exchange interactions.
First, we show that the high spin stability of an iron trimer can be remotely
detected by a nearby iron atom, and how the DM interaction can lead to its
destabilization. Second, we find that adding more nearby iron atoms almost
always leads to a destabilization of the trimer, due to a non-local effective
transverse anisotropy originating in the symmetric anisotropic exchange
interaction. This transverse anisotropy can be quenched only for highly
symmetric structures, for which the spin lifetime of the array is increased by
orders of magnitude.

alleviate the data sparsity issue in CF. However, they only considered the
local neighbors of each user and neglected the process that users' preferences
are influenced as information diffuses in the social network. Recently, Graph
Convolutional Networks~(GCN) have shown promising results by modeling the
information diffusion process in graphs that leverage both graph structure and

the strengths of GCNs to capture how users' preferences are influenced by the

preferences is built on a layer-wise diffusion manner, with the initial user
embedding as a function of the current user's features and a free base user
latent vector that is not contained in the user feature. Similarly, each item's
latent vector is also a combination of the item's free latent vector, as well

flexible when user and item features are not available. Finally, extensive

plasma density measurements show that the decreasing frequencies were due to
the refilling of the plasmasphere following the storm. The waves were likely
generated by internal plasma processes. Further exploration of the audio

spiral galaxies, using the data of global three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We assume a frequency independent
depolarization in our observational visualization. We find that the appearance
of the global magnetic field depends on the viewing angle: a face-on view
seemingly has hybrid magnetic field types combining axisymmetric modes with
higer order modes; at a viewing angle of $\sim 70\degr$, the galaxy seems to
contain a ring-like magnetic field structure; while in edge-on view, only field
structure parallel to the disk can be seen. The magnetic vector seen at 8~GHz
traces the global magnetic field inside the disk. These results indicate that
the topology of global magnetic field obtained from the relation between
azimuthal angle and Faraday depth strongly depends on the viewing anglue of the
galaxy. As one of the examples, we compare our results at a viewing angle of
$25\degr$ with the results of IC342. The relation between azimuthal angle and
Faraday depth of the numerical result shows a tendency similar to IC342, such

minimizing the KL divergence between a truncated distribution and the optimal

measure the size of the QGP fireball created in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. However, since it is sensitive to the correlations between the
particles in the final state, it has been shown recently that the parameters of
the strong interaction can be probed as well. This review includes a broad

observables. Comparison with numerical simulations is helpful to understand the
real structures, and observational visualization of numerical data is an
important task. Machida et al. (2018) have reported Faraday depth maps obtained
from numerical simulations. They showed that the relation between azimuthal
angle and Faraday depth depends on the inclination angle. In this paper, we
investigate 100MHz to 10GHz radio synchrotron emission from spiral galaxies,
using the data of global three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We
model internal and external Faraday depolarization at small scales and assume a
frequency independent depolarization. It is found that the internal and
external Faraday depolarization becomes comparable inside the disk and the
dispersion of Faraday depth becomes about 4rad/m^{2} for face-on view and
40rad/m2 for edge-on view, respectively. The internal depolarization becomes
ineffective in the halo. Because of the magnetic turbulence inside the disk,
frequency independent depolarization works well and the polarization degree
becomes 0.3 at high frequency. When the observed frequency is in the 100 MHz
band, polarized intensity vanishes in the disk, while that from the halo can be
observed. Because the remaining component of polarized intensity is weak in the
halo and the polarization degree is about a few %, it may be difficult to
observe that component. These results indicate that the structures of global
magnetic fields in spiral galaxies could be elucidated, if broadband
polarimetry such as that with the Square Kilometre Array is achieved.

with ionic liquids have shown strong potential for tuning the electronic states

dramatic changes in physical properties when compared to parent materials,
e.g., insulating-superconducting transition. Generally, the modification of
gate voltage ($V_{\rm G}$) in EDLT devices produces a direct change on the
doping level, whereas the processing temperature ($T_{\rm G}$) at which $V_{\rm
G}$ is applied only assists the tuning process. Here, we report that the
processing temperature $T_{\rm G}$ plays a dominant role in the electric field
induced superconductivity in layered ZrNBr. When applying $V_{\rm G}$ at
$T_{\rm G}\geq$ 250 K, the induced superconducting (SC) state permanently
remains in the material, which is confirmed in the zero resistance and
diamagnetism after long-time relaxation at room temperature and/or by applying
reverse voltage, whereas the solid/liquid interface induced reversible
insulating-SC transition occurs at $T_{\rm G}\leq$ 235 K. These experimental
facts support another electrochemical mechanism that electric field induced
partial deintercalation of Br ions could cause permanent electron doping to the

H$\alpha$ observations, we identified the H$\alpha$-emitting gas as the Faraday
screen responsible for the observed Faraday depolarization. We were able to
derive the magnetic field strength in the H$\alpha$-emitting gas, finding
typical field strengths of $\sim1$ $\mu$G, which is consistent with studies of
the intra-group medium local to other radio galaxies. However, we find a highly
depolarized region of the southern lobe coincident with a H$\alpha$ filament

shielding of stray magnetic field around the vapor cell is required for the
accuracy and stability of laser locking. Here on the contrary, by applying a

larger than 100:1. The error signal is immune to the external magnetic

for a resonant semi-classical system of radiation and ion cluster-solvated

this system, ions in the cluster carry the same electric charge and move with
very low, non-relativistic velocities in a direction parallel to an applied
unidirectional static electric field. The role of the static electric field is
to induce electrostatic mixing of the rotational states of the water molecules.
We assume that the dimensions of the ion cluster are much shorter than the

describe rotating water molecules quantum mechanically by using a two-level
approximation, and we show that the equations of motion of the system are the
same as those of a conventional free electron laser system. This result and the
existence of permanent electric polarization of the water molecules by
electrostatic mixing lead to a mechanism for radiation coherence induced by
collective instability in the wave-particle interaction. As an illustrative
example, we apply this mechanism to action potential propagation in myelinated
neuronal axons of the human brain.

demonstrated that the probability distribution function (PDF) of the gas

a pure power-law distribution. It has been claimed that the log-normal part is
ruled out when using only the part of the PDF up/down to which it is complete,
that is where the column density contours are still closed. By using the
results from high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations of molecular
cloud formation and evolution, we find that the column density PDF is indeed
composed of a log-normal and, if including self-gravity, a power-law part. We
show that insufficient sampling of a molecular cloud results in closed contours
that cut off the log-normal part. In contrast, systematically increasing the
field of view and sampling the entire cloud yields a completeness limit at the
lower column densities, which also recovers the log-normal part. This
demonstrates that the field of view must be sufficiently large for the PDF to
be complete down to its log-normal part, which has important implications for
predictions of star-formation activity based on the PDF.

the oscillation signal in order to overcome this obstacle. Micromagnetic
simulations demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic skyrmion-based spin torque
nano-oscillators can produce high frequencies (tens of GHz). Furthermore, the
speed of the circular motion for an antiferromagnetic skyrmion in a nanodisk is
analytically derived, which agrees well with the results of numerical
simulations. Our findings are useful for the understanding of the inertial
dynamics of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion and the development of future
skyrmion-based spin torque nano-oscillators.

of our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting
to predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect
large volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a
successful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is
executing, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a
centralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper
we demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the

system previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate
that DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader
that provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever
demonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or
super-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world

could, in principle, observe the actions of a human trader in a real financial

labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or
fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are
built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock

well as competitions for power. Characterizing the origins, types and
competitive strength of different kinds of power may yield a scaffolding for
understanding historical processes and mechanisms for winning or avoiding
conflicts. Michael Mann distinguished four types of power: political, military,
economic, and ideological. We show this framework is justified by four
motivations of individuals to transfer decisions to leaders: Desire to be a
member of a collective, avoiding harm due to threat, gaining benefit due to
payment, acquiring a value system. Constructing models of societies based upon
these types of power enables distinguishing social systems and describing their
dynamics. Dynamics include (a) competition between power systems, (b)
competition between powerful individuals, and (c) the dynamics of values within
a powerful individual. A historical trend is the progressive separation of
types of power to distinct groups of individuals. In ancient empires all forms
of power were concentrated in a single individual, e.g. Caesar during the Pax
Romana period. In an idealized modern democratic state, the four types of power
are concentrated in distinct sets of individuals. The progressive separation
suggests that in some contexts this confers a ""fitness"" advantage in an
evolutionary process similar to the selection of biological organisms. However,
individual countries may not separate power completely. The influence of wealth
in politics and regulatory capture is a signature of economic leader dominance,
e.g. the US. Important roles of political leaders in economics and corruption
are a signature of the political leader dominance, e.g. China. Ideological
leaders dominate in theocracies, e.g. Iran. Military leaders dominate in
dictatorships or where military leaders select leadership, e.g. Egypt.

from a database without revealing any information on the file being requested.
As of now, PIR schemes have been proposed for several kinds of storage systems,
including replicated and MDS-coded data. In this paper, the problem of
constructing a PIR scheme on regenerating codes is considered.
  A regenerating code is a storage code whose codewords are distributed among
$n$ nodes, enabling efficient storage of files, as well as low-bandwidth
retrieval of files and repair of nodes. In this work, a PIR scheme on
regenerating codes is constructed, using the product-matrix (PM) framework of
Rashmi, Shah and Kumar. Both the minimum-bandwidth (MBR) and minimum-storage
(MSR) settings are considered, and the structure given by the PM framework is
used in order to reduce the download communication complexity of our schemes.

Therefore two fundamental studies were conducted: the first involved
temperature measurement of a wrought dummy wall so that the microstructural
changes in the heat affected zone (HAZ) could be related to the thermal cycle.
This demonstrated that the white band in the microstructure corresponded to 825
C well below the beta-transus temperature and above this boundary the bi-modal
substrate material was converted to lamellar. The second involved peening WAAM
material along the side of a deposited wall before applying a typical WAAM
thermal heat treatment. This showed that refinement occurred up to the first
layer band in the microstructure and the smallest grains were observed just
above this boundary at higher temperatures significant grain growth occurred.
This study has provided the foundational understanding of microstructural
changes that will facilitate future process developments.

sticking at 1200 K. Only above 1400K do basalt grains in contact with each

pulsars (PSRs J0026+6320, J2208+5500 and J2217+5733) discovered with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). These observations were carried out with the
GMRT and the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). We report improved timing solutions
for all three pulsars. For PSR J2208+5500, we estimate the nulling fraction to
be 53(3)\%. The steep spectrum of this pulsar, its single component profile,
and narrow pulse width suggest its single component to be a core component. If
so, this significant cessation of emission in a core component is inconsistent
with a geometric origin of nulls, such as those due to `empty' sightline
traverses, and more likely due to intrinsic changes in the pulsar
magnetosphere. We have measured scatter-broadening timescales at 325 and 610
MHz for PSRs J0026+6320 and J2217+5733. The implied scatter-broadening
frequency scaling index of $-$2.9 for both pulsars is different from that
expected assuming Kolmogorov turbulence in the interstellar medium. We also
report spectral indices, obtained from imaging observations, for all three
pulsars for the first time. The spectra for two of these pulsars indicate a
possible spectral turnover between 100$-$300 MHz. Multi-frequency timing
analyses carried out for these pulsars have enabled us to determine dispersion
measures (DMs) with accuracies of 0.01 pc cm\sups{--3}. This demonstrates the
usefulness of quasi-simultaneous multi-frequency multi-epoch timing
observations with the GMRT and the ORT for studying variations in DM for
millisecond pulsars.

system, where the base station is mounted with an analog beamforming phased
array, and multiple users are served in the same time-frequency resource block.
To guarantee user fairness, we formulate a joint beamforming and power
allocation problem to maximize the minimal achievable rate among the users,
i.e., we adopt the max-min fairness. As the problem is difficult to solve due
to the non-convex formulation and high dimension of the optimization variables,
we propose a sub-optimal solution, which makes use of the spatial sparsity in
the angle domain of the mmWave channel. In the solution, the closed-form
optimal power allocation is obtained first, which reduces the joint
optimization problem into an equivalent beamforming problem. Then an
appropriate beamforming vector is designed. Simulation results show that the
proposed solution can achieve a near-upper-bound performance in terms of
achievable rate, which is significantly better than that of the conventional
mmWave orthogonal multiple access (mmWave-OMA) system.

this network is inspired by the Integrated Object Detection CNN (IOD-CNN) where
object information is indirectly exploited by the event recognition module

intermediate object detection outputs are directly injected into the event
recognition network while keeping the indirect sharing structure inherited from
the IOD-CNN, thus being `doubly-injected'. We also introduce a batch pooling
layer which constructs one representative feature map from multiple object
hypotheses. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of injecting the object
detection information in two different ways in the task of malicious event

fields generated by a cluster of highly contrasted bubbles for a wide range of
densities and bulk moduli contrasts. We derive the equivalent fields when the
cluster of bubbles is appropriately distributed (but not necessarily
periodically) in a bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$. We handle two
situations.
  1. In the first one, we distribute the bubbles to occupy a $3$ dimensional
domain. For this case, we show that the equivalent speed of propagation changes
sign when the medium is excited with frequencies smaller or larger than (but
not necessarily close to) the Minnaert resonance. As a consequence, this medium
behaves as a reflective or absorbing depending on whether the used frequency is
smaller or larger than this resonance. In addition, if the used frequency is
extremely close to this resonance, for a cluster of bubbles with density above
a certain threshold, then the medium behaves as a 'wall', i.e. allowing no
incident sound to penetrate.
  2. In the second one, we distribute the bubbles to occupy a $2$ dimensional
(open or closed) surface, not necessarily flat. For this case, we show that the
equivalent medium is modeled by a Dirac potential supported on that surface.
The sign of the surface potential changes for frequencies smaller or larger
than the Minnaert resonance, i.e. it behaves as a smart metasurface reducing or
amplifying the transmitted sound across it. As in the $3$D case, if the used
frequency is extremely close to this resonance, for a cluster of bubbles with
density above an appropriate threshold, then the surface allows no incident
sound to be transmitted across the surface, i.e. it behaves as a white screen.

at the maximum apparent approximation of two moving natural satellites in the
sky plane. This can be used in ephemeris fitting to infer the relative
positions between satellites with high precision. Only the mutual phenomena --
occultations and eclipses -- may achieve better results. However, mutual
phenomena only occur every six years in the case of Jupiter. Mutual
approximations do not have this restriction and can be observed at any time
along the year as long as the satellites are visible. In this work, we present
104 central instants determined from the observations of 66 mutual
approximations between the Galilean moons carried out at different sites in
Brazil and France during the period 2016--2018. For 28 events we have at least
two independent observations. All telescopes were equipped with a narrow-band
filter centred at 889 nm with a width of 15 nm to eliminate the scattered light
from Jupiter. The telescope apertures ranged between 25--120 cm. For
comparison, the precision of the positions obtained with classical CCD
astrometry is about 100 mas, for mutual phenomena it can achieve 10 mas or less
and the average internal precision obtained with mutual approximations was 11.3
mas. This new kind of simple, yet accurate observations can significantly
improve the orbits and ephemeris of Galilean satellites and thus be very useful
for the planning of future space missions aiming at the Jovian system.

implications for reservoir engineering applications. Deformations, and the
corresponding change in solid contact area and aperture field, impact rock
fracture stiffness and permeability thus altering the reservoir properties
significantly. Simulating contact between fractures is numerically difficult as
the non-penetration constraints lead to a nonlinear problem and the surface
meshes of the solid bodies on the opposing fracture sides may be non-matching.
Furthermore, the challenging geometry of the arising constraints requires to
solve the problem in several iterations, adjusting the constraints in each one.
Here we present a novel discrete implementation of a dual mortar method and a
non-smooth SQP solver, suitable for parallel computing, and apply it to a two
body contact problem consisting of realistic rock fracture geometries from the
Grimsel underground laboratory in Switzerland. The contributions of this
article are: 1) a novel, parallel implementation of a dual mortar method and
non-smooth SQP method, 2) realistic rock geometries with rough surfaces, and 3)
numerical examples, which prove that the dual mortar method is capable of
replicating the nonlinear closure behavior of fractures, observed in laboratory
experiments.

Representative Democracy (RD) and Direct Democracy (DD) in which voters can
alter the issue-dependent weights of a set of elected representatives. In line
with the literature on Interactive Democracy, our model allows the voters to
actively determine the degree to which the system is direct versus
representative. However, unlike Liquid Democracy, Flexible Representative
Democracy uses strictly non-transitive delegations, making delegation cycles
impossible, and maintains a fixed set of accountable, elected representatives.
We present FRD and analyze it using a computational approach with issues that
are binary and symmetric. We compare the outcomes of various voting systems
using Direct Democracy with majority voting as an ideal baseline. First, we
demonstrate the shortcomings of Representative Democracy in our model. We
provide NP-Hardness results for electing an ideal set of representatives,
discuss pathologies, and demonstrate empirically that common multi-winner
election rules for selecting representatives do not perform well in
expectation. To analyze the effects of adding flexibility, we begin by
providing theoretical results on how issue-specific delegations determine
outcomes. Finally, we provide empirical results comparing the outcomes of
Representative Democracy, proxy voting with fixed sets of proxies across
issues, and Flexible Representative Democracy with issue-specific delegations.
Our results show that variants of Proxy Voting yield no discernible benefit

Representative Democracy to improve outcomes as voter participation increases.

decades-long mystery and is something that has never been observed in any other
astrophysical object. The occurrence of such features requires a dense
environment with temperatures near $10^6$K, by far exceeding the stellar
effective temperature. Here we report the discovery of a new hot wind white
dwarf, GALEXJ014636.8+323615. Astonishingly, we found for the first time rapid
changes of the equivalent widths of the UHE features, which are correlated to
the rotational period of the star ($P=0.242035$d). We explain this with the
presence of a wind-fed circumstellar magnetosphere in which magnetically
confined wind shocks heat up the material to the high temperatures required for
the creation of the UHE lines. The photometric and spectroscopic variability of
GALEXJ014636.8+323615 can then be understood as consequence of the obliquity of
the magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis of the white dwarf. This is
the first time a wind-fed circumstellar magnetosphere around an apparently
isolated white dwarf has been discovered and finally offers a plausible
explanation of the ultra hot wind phenomenon.

can accelerate the process of analysis, e.g. automatic selection of meaningful

the selection of meaningful channels during online decoding in brain-computer
interface applications, where threshold crossing events are usually for feature
extraction, even though they do not necessarily correspond to neural events.
Here, we propose a novel algorithm based on the newly introduced way of feature
vector extraction and a supervised deep learning method: a universal spike

USC uses the standard architecture of convolutional neural networks (Conv net).
It takes the batch of the waveforms, instead of a single waveform as an input,
propagates it through the multilayered structure, and finally classifies it as
a channel containing neural spike data or artifacts. We have trained the model
of USC on data recorded from single tetraplegic patient with Utah arrays

a formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors as
the problem of computing separating finite state automata under controllability

the data obtained from multiple views. Different from single view case, MSL
should take both common and specific knowledge among different views into
consideration. To enhance the robustness of model, the complexity,
non-consistency and similarity of noise in multi-view data should be fully
taken into consideration. Most current MSL methods only assume a simple
Gaussian or Laplacian distribution for the noise while neglect the complex
noise configurations in each view and noise correlations among different views
of practical data. To this issue, this work initiates a MSL method by encoding
the multi-view-shared and single-view-specific noise knowledge in data.
Specifically, we model data noise in each view as a separated Mixture of
Gaussians (MoG), which can fit a wider range of complex noise types than
conventional Gaussian/Laplacian. Furthermore, we link all single-view-noise as
a whole by regularizing them by a common MoG component, encoding the shared
noise knowledge among them. Such regularization component can be formulated as
a concise KL-divergence regularization term under a MAP framework, leading to
good interpretation of our model and simple EM-based solving strategy to the
problem. Experimental results substantiate the superiority of our method.

simple, useful, and accessible form of compressed sensing that increases the
frame acquisition rate of any camera by several orders of magnitude by
leveraging its dynamic range. VFT is a powerful tool for capturing rapid
phenomenon where the dynamics facilitate a transition between two states, and
are thus binary. The advantages of VFT are demonstrated by examining such
dynamics in five physical processes at unprecedented rates and spatial
resolution: fracture of an elastic solid, wetting of a solid surface, rapid
fingerprint reading, peeling of adhesive tape, and impact of an elastic
hemisphere on a hard surface. We show that the performance of the VFT exceeds
that of any commercial high speed camera not only in rate of imaging but also
in field of view, achieving a 65MHz frame rate at 4MPx resolution. Finally, we
discuss the performance of the VFT with several commercially available

  Infinite Hyperfinite Subproperty",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most fundamental questions in graph property testing is to
characterize the combinatorial structure of properties that are testable with a
constant number of queries. We work towards an answer to this question for the
bounded-degree graph model introduced in [Goldreich, Ron, 2002], where the
input graphs have maximum degree bounded by a constant $d$. In this model, it
is known (among other results) that every \emph{hyperfinite} property is
constant-query testable [Newman, Sohler, 2013], where, informally, a graph
property is hyperfinite, if for every $\delta >0$ every graph in the property
can be partitioned into small connected components by removing $\delta n$
edges.
  In this paper we show that hyperfiniteness plays a role in \emph{every}
testable property, i.e. we show that every testable property is either finite
(which trivially implies hyperfiniteness and testability) or contains an
infinite hyperfinite subproperty. A simple consequence of our result is that no
infinite graph property that only consists of expander graphs is constant-query
testable.
  Based on the above findings, one could ask if every infinite testable
non-hyperfinite property might contain an infinite family of expander (or
near-expander) graphs. We show that this is not true. Motivated by our
counter-example we develop a theorem that shows that we can partition the set
of vertices of every bounded degree graph into a constant number of subsets and
a separator set, such that the separator set is small and the distribution of
$k$-disks on every subset of a partition class, is roughly the same as that of
the partition class if the subset has small expansion.

issue is to learn a diverse set of successful behaviors for a given task, from

learning a generative model over policies. Rather than learning a single
policy, or a small fixed repertoire, our generative model for policies
compactly encodes an unbounded number of policies and allows novel controller
variants to be sampled. Leveraging our generative policy network, a robot can
sample novel behaviors until it finds one that works for a new environment. We
demonstrate this idea with an application of robust ball-throwing in the

of behaviors than an existing evolutionary approach, while maintaining good
efficacy of sampled behaviors, allowing a Baxter robot to hit targets more
often when ball throwing in the presence of obstacles.

as our main goal, of interior-boundary conditions (IBCs). IBCs are a new
approach to defining UV-regular Hamiltonians for quantum field theories without
smearing particles out or discretizing space. For obtaining such Hamiltonians,
the method of IBCs provides an alternative to renormalization and has been
successfully used so far in non-relativistic models, where it could be applied
also in cases in which no renormalization method was known. A natural next
question about IBCs is how to set them up for the Dirac equation, and here we
take first steps towards the answer. For quantum field theories, the relevant
boundary consists of the surfaces in $n$-particle configuration space
$\mathbb{R}^{3n}$ on which two particles have the same location in
$\mathbb{R}^3$. While this boundary has codimension 3, we focus here on the
more basic situation in which the boundary has codimension 1 in configuration

show that the precoders for RA and TA antennas have to meet different

Subsequently, the atmospheric densities are related to characteristic ICME

increased solar activity may lead to a decrease of the satellites orbital
altitude we additionally assessed the orbital decay for each of the events and

quantities that incorporate a non-Hermitian effect due to anomalous operators
that break the domain of definition of the Hermitian Hamiltonian. As a result,
boundary contributions to the observable are rigorously and analytically taken
into account. In this framework, we extend the standard velocity operator
definition in order to incorporate an anomaly of the position operator that is
inherent in band theory, which results in an explicit boundary velocity
contribution. Using the extended velocity, we define the electrons' intrinsic
orbital circulation and we argue that this is the main quantity that captures
the orbital magnetization phenomenon. As evidence of this assertion, we
demonstrate the explicit relation between the nth band electrons' collective
intrinsic circulation and the approximated, evaluated with respect to Wannier
states, local and itinerant circulation contributions that are frequently used
in the modern theory of orbital magnetization. A quantum mechanical formalism
for the orbital magnetization of extended and periodic topological solids

approximation or heuristic extension [Caresoli, Thonhauser, Vanderbilt and

result of the non-Hermitian effect, an emerging covariant derivative enters the
one-band (adiabatically deformed) approximation k-space expression for the
orbital magnetization. In the corresponding many-band (unrestricted) k-space
formula, the non-Hermitian effect contributes an additional boundary quantity

censorship conjecture in the interaction of Kerr-Sen black holes with neutral
test fields. Previous studies of the Klein-Gordon equation on Kerr-Sen
background imply that superradiance occurs for scalar fields. We show that
scalar fields can overspin a nearly extremal black hole into a naked
singularity, but the modes that could overspin an extremal black hole are not
absorbed due to superradiance. From Kerr analogy one can naively expect
superradiance to be absent for fermionic fields. In such a case overspinning
becomes generic and also applies to extremal Kerr-Sen black holes. This robust
violation of cosmic censorship cannot be fixed by backreaction effects which
are ignored in this work. These results are analogous to the Kerr case.

decades for large-scale linear discrete ill-posed problems, where the iteration
number $k$ plays the role of the regularization parameter. It has been long
known that if the Ritz values in LSQR converge to the large singular values of
$A$ in natural order until its semi-convergence then LSQR must have the same
the regularization ability as the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD)
method and can compute a 2-norm filtering best possible regularized solution.
However, hitherto there has been no definitive rigorous result on the
approximation behavior of the Ritz values in the context of ill-posed problems.
In this paper, for severely, moderately and mildly ill-posed problems, we give
accurate solutions of the two closely related fundamental and highly
challenging problems on the regularization of LSQR: (i) How accurate are the
low rank approximations generated by Lanczos bidiagonalization? (ii) Whether or
not the Ritz values involved in LSQR approximate the large singular values of
$A$ in natural order? We also show how to judge the accuracy of low rank
approximations reliably during computation without extra cost. Numerical
experiments confirm our results.

attention in various research fields. However, restricted by the low
reconstruction quality and large amount of measurements, the practical
application is still in its infancy. Inspired by the fact that natural scenes
exhibit unique degenerate structures in the low dimensional subspace, we
propose to take advantage of the local prior in convolutional sparse coding to
implement high fidelity single-pixel imaging. Specifically, by statistically
learning strategy, the target scene can be sparse represented on an
overcomplete dictionary. The dictionary is composed of various basis learned
from a natural image database. We introduce the above local prior into
conventional SPI framework to promote the final reconstruction quality.
Experiments both on synthetic data and real captured data demonstrate that our
method can achieve better reconstruction from the same measurements, and thus
consequently reduce the number of required measurements for same reconstruction

characterizes signals or images via the fluctuations of their pointwise
regularity, quantified theoretically by the so-called multifractal spectrum.
The practical estimation of the multifractal spectrum fundamentally relies on
exploiting the scale dependence of statistical properties of appropriate
multiscale quantities, such as wavelet leaders, that can be robustly computed
from discrete data. Despite successes of multifractal analysis in various
real-world applications, current estimation procedures remain essentially
limited to providing concave upper-bound estimates, while there is a priori no
reason for the multifractal spectrum to be a concave function. This work
addresses this severe practical limitation and proposes a novel formalism for
multifractal analysis that enables nonconcave multifractal spectra to be
estimated in a stable way. The key contributions reside in the development and
theoretical study of a generalized multifractal formalism to assess the
multiscale statistics of wavelet leaders, and in devising a practical algorithm
that permits this formalism to be applied to real-world data, allowing for the
estimation of nonconcave multifractal spectra. Numerical experiments are
conducted on several synthetic multifractal processes as well as on a
real-world remote-sensing image and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed
multifractal formalism over the state of the art.

disease biomarkers and in combination with nervous tissue modeling, provides
access to microstructural parameters. Recently, DKI and subsequent estimation
of microstructural model parameters has been used for assessment of tissue
changes in neurodegenerative diseases and their animal models. In this study,
mouse spinal cords from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
model of multiple sclerosis (MS) were investigated for the first time using DKI
in combination with biophysical modeling to study the relationship between
microstructural metrics and degree of animal dysfunction. Thirteen spinal cords
were extracted from animals of variable disability and scanned in a high-field
MRI scanner along with five control specimen. Diffusion weighted data were
acquired together with high resolution T2* images. Diffusion data were fit to
estimate diffusion and kurtosis tensors and white matter modeling parameters,
which were all used for subsequent statistical analysis using a linear mixed
effects model. T2* images were used to delineate focal
demyelination/inflammation. Our results unveil a strong relationship between
disability and measured microstructural parameters in normal appearing white
matter and gray matter. The changes we found in biophysical modeling parameters
and in particular in extra-axonal axial diffusivity were clearly different from
previous studies employing other animal models of MS. In conclusion, our data
suggest that DKI and microstructural modeling can provide a unique contrast
capable of detecting EAE-specific changes correlating with clinical disability.
These findings could close the gap between MRI findings and clinical
presentation in patients and deepen our understanding of EAE and the MS
mechanisms.

show a gap centered at ~74au with a width of ~23au, surrounded by a bright ring
centered at ~98au from the central star. Detailed radiative transfer modeling
of both the ALMA image and the broadband spectral energy distribution is used
to constrain the surface density profile and structural parameters of the disk.
If the width of the gap corresponds to 4~8 times the Hill radius of a single
forming planet, then the putative planet would have a mass of 0.4~3 M_Jup. We
test this prediction by performing global three-dimensional smoothed particle
hydrodynamic gas/dust simulations of disks hosting a migrating and accreting
planet. We find that the dust emission across the disk is consistent with the
presence of an embedded planet with a mass of ~2.3 M_Jup at an orbital radius
of ~78au. Given the surface density of the best-fit radiative transfer model,
the amount of depleted mass in the gap is higher than the mass of the putative
planet, which satisfies the basic condition for the formation of such a planet.

comprehensive simulations on massive parallel computers. The framework runs
user-developed simulators with various input parameters in parallel without
requiring the knowledge of parallel programming. The framework is useful for
exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces, for which sampling points must be
dynamically determined based on the previous results. Possible use cases
include optimization, data assimilation, and Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling
in parameter spaces. As a demonstration, we applied CARAVAN to an evacuation
planning problem in an urban area. We formulated the problem as a
multi-objective optimization problem, and searched for solutions using
multi-agent simulations and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which
were developed as modules of the framework.

  Quarks and Gluons","13 pages latex. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1810.12088",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present lattice QCD method can not study the hadron formation from the
quarks and gluons. This is because it operates the unphysical QCD Hamiltonian
of all the quarks plus antiquarks plus gluons inside the hadron on the physical
energy eigenstate of the hadron to obtain the physical energy eigenvalue of the
hadron which is not correct because of the non-vanishing boundary surface term
in the energy conservation equation in QCD due to the confinement of quarks,
antiquarks and gluons inside the finite size hadron. In this paper we present
the correct formulation of the lattice QCD method to study the physical hadron
formation from the unphysical quarks, antiquarks and gluons inside the hadron
by using this non-vanishing boundary surface term in the lattice QCD.

changed people's thought. The use of Information Technology tools in people's
daily life has changed their life style completely. The advent of various
innovative smart products in the market has tremendous impact on people's
lifestyle. They want to know their heart beat while they run, they need a smart
car which makes them alert when they become sleepy while driving, and they need
an IT tool which can make their home safer when they are out. These quests of
people to the very extent have been fulfilled by development of many Meta
products like wearables, smart phones, smart car etc. The concept of Meta
product is based on the fact that they need to offer intelligent services to
the users. In present day's Meta products market, the manufacturers have their
own cloud based platform which is used by the products for which it is
developed. The other products cannot use the common platform. In this paper, we
propose a common cloud based platform that will be used by any Meta product's
user to get different services.

construct general compound Hawkes processes and investigate their properties in

prove a Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and a Functional Central Limit Theorems

limit order books to study the link between price volatility and order flow,
where the volatility in mid-price changes is expressed in terms of parameters
describing the arrival rates and mid-price process.

transactions between addresses, each associated with a logical entity. In this
work, we introduce a complete probabilistic model of the Bitcoin Blockchain. We
first formulate a set of conditional dependencies induced by the Bitcoin
protocol at the block level and derive a corresponding fully observed graphical
model of a Bitcoin block. We then extend the model to include hidden entity
attributes such as the functional category of the associated logical agent and
derive asymptotic bounds on the privacy properties implied by this model. At
the network level, we show evidence of complex transaction-to-transaction
behavior and present a relevant discriminative model of the agent categories.
Performance of both the block-based graphical model and the network-level
discriminative model is evaluated on a subset of the public Bitcoin Blockchain.
