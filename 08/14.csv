delaminated forming a so-called quantum blister in the graphene sheet. Electron
and hole states can be confined in this graphene quantum blisters (GQB) by
applying a global electrostatic bias. We scrutinize the electronic properties
of these confined states under the variation of interlayer bias, coupling, and
blister's size. The spectra display strong anti-crossings due to the coupling
of the confined states on upper and lower layers inside the blister. These
spectra are layer localized where the respective confined states reside on
either layer or equally distributed. For finite angular momentum, this layer
localization can be at the edge of the blister and corresponds to degenerate
modes of opposite momenta. Furthermore, the energy levels in GQB exhibit
electron-hole symmetry that is sensitive to the electrostatic bias. Finally, we
demonstrate that confinement in GQB persists even in the presence of a
variation in the inter-layer coupling.

predictive models for complex physical, chemical, biological and social

black box, rarely providing information about what made them arrive at a
particular prediction. This black box aspect of ML techniques can be
problematic especially in medical diagnoses, so far hampering a clinical
acceptance. The present paper studies the uniqueness of individual gait
patterns in clinical biomechanics using DNNs. By attributing portions of the
model predictions back to the input variables (ground reaction forces and
full-body joint angles), the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique
reliably demonstrates which variables at what time windows of the gait cycle
are most relevant for the characterisation of gait patterns from a certain
individual. By measuring the time-resolved contribution of each input variable
to the prediction of ML techniques such as DNNs, our method describes the first
general framework that enables to understand and interpret non-linear ML
methods in (biomechanical) gait analysis and thereby supplies a powerful tool
for analysis, diagnosis and treatment of human gait.

possible. However, latent characteristics of an epidemic and its evolution can
often be inferred from the synthesis of indirect information from various
routine data sources, as well as expert opinion. The simultaneous synthesis of
multiple data sources, often conveniently carried out in a Bayesian framework,
poses a number of statistical and computational challenges: the heterogeneity
in type, relevance and granularity of the data, together with selection and
informative observation biases, lead to complex probabilistic models that are
difficult to build and fit, and challenging to criticize. Using motivating case
studies of influenza, this chapter illustrates the cycle of model development
and criticism in the context of Bayesian evidence synthesis, highlighting the
challenges of complex model building, computationally efficient inference, and

modulation, is emerging as a potential candidate for green Internet of Things
(IoT). In cognitive backscatter systems, the backscatter device (BD) shares not
only the same spectrum, but also the same radio-frequency (RF) source with the
legacy system. In this paper, we investigate the signal transmission problem,
in which a basic transmission model is considered which consists of K RF
sources, one BD and one reader equipped with M antennas. A non-cooperative
scenario is considered, where there is no cooperation between the legacy
systems and the backscatter system, and no pilots are transmitted from the RF
sources or BD to the reader. The on-off keying differential modulation is
adopted to achieve noncoherent transmission. Firstly, through the capacity
analyses, we point out that high-throughput backscatter transmission can be
achieved when the number of the receive antennas satisfies M>K. The Chernoff
Information (CI) is also derived to predict the detection performance. Next, we
address the signal detection problem at the reader. The optimal soft decision
(SD) and suboptimal hard decision (HD) detectors are designed based on the
maximum likelihood criterion. To tackle the non-cooperation challenge, a fully
blind channel estimation method is proposed to learn the detection-required
parameters based on clustering. Extensive numerical results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed detectors and the channel estimation method. In
addition, it is illustrated that the increase of K may not necessarily lead to
performance degradation when multiple receive antennas are exploited.

homogeneous Markov chain on a general state space. The summands are
heavy-tailed and the limits are stable distributions. The conditions imposed on
the transition operator $P$ of the Markov chain ensure that the limit is the
same as if the summands were independent. Such a~scheme admits a physical
interpretation, as given in Jara et al. (Ann. Appl. Probab., 19 (2009),
2270--2300).
  We considerably extend the results of Jara et al., (ibid.) and Cattiaux and
Manou-Abi (ESAIM Probab. Stat., 18 (2014), 468--486). We show that the theory
holds under the assumption of operator uniform integrability in $L^2$ of $P$ (a
notion introduced by Wu (J. Funct. Anal., 172 (2000), 301--376)) plus the
$L^2$-spectral gap property. If we strengthen the uniform integrability in
$L^2$ to the hyperboundedness, then the $L^2$-spectral gap property can be
relaxed to the strong mixing at geometric rate (in practice: to geometric
ergodicity).
  We provide an example of a Markov chain on a countable space that is
uniformly integrable in $L^2$ (and admits an $L^2$-spectral gap), while it is
not hyperbounded. Moreover, we show by example that hyperboundedness is still a
weaker property than $\phi$-mixing, what enlarges the range of models of
interest.
  What makes our assumptions working is a new, efficient version of the
Principle of Conditioning that operates with conditional characteristic
functions rather than predictable characteristics.

while preserving the behavior of a system. Several (semi)automated approaches
have been proposed to support developers in this maintenance activity, based on
the correction of anti-patterns, which are `poor' solutions to recurring design
problems. However, little quantitative evidence exists about the impact of
automatically refactored code on program comprehension, and in which context
automated refactoring can be as effective as manual refactoring. Leveraging
RePOR, an automated refactoring approach based on partial order reduction
techniques, we performed an empirical study to investigate whether automated
refactoring code structure affects the understandability of systems during
comprehension tasks. (1) We surveyed 80 developers, asking them to identify
from a set of 20 refactoring changes if they were generated by developers or by
a tool, and to rate the refactoring changes according to their design quality;
(2) we asked 30 developers to complete code comprehension tasks on 10 systems
that were refactored by either a freelancer or an automated refactoring tool.
To make comparison fair, for a subset of refactoring actions that introduce new
code entities, only synthetic identifiers were presented to practitioners. We
measured developers' performance using the NASA task load index for their
effort, the time that they spent performing the tasks, and their percentages of
correct answers. Our findings, despite current technology limitations, show
that it is reasonable to expect a refactoring tools to match developer code.

recently. Among several recent proposed compression algorithms, Residual
Gradient Compression (RGC) is one of the most successful approaches---it can
significantly compress the transmitting message size (0.1\% of the gradient
size) of each node and still achieve correct accuracy and the same convergence

exclusively on achieving good theoretical compression rate, while the
efficiency of RGC in real distributed implementation has been less
investigated. In this paper, we develop an RGC-based system that is able to
reduce the end-to-end training time on real-world multi-GPU systems. Our
proposed design called RedSync, which introduces a set of optimizations to
reduce communication bandwidth requirement while introducing limited overhead.
We evaluate the performance of RedSync on two different multiple GPU platforms,
including 128 GPUs of a supercomputer and an 8-GPU server. Our test cases

$T_0$ rises steadily from $T_0\sim 6000\, \mathrm{K}$ at $z=5.4$, peaks at
$14000\, \mathrm{K}$ for $z\sim 3.4$, and decreases at lower redshift reaching
$T_0\sim 7000\, \mathrm{K}$ by $z\sim1.8$. This evolution provides conclusive
evidence for photoionization heating resulting from the reionization of He II,
as well as the subsequent cooling of the IGM due to the expansion of the
Universe after all reionization events are complete. Our results are broadly
consistent with previous measurements of thermal evolution based on a variety

both the reservoir of gas that fuels galaxy growth and the repository of gas
expelled by galactic winds. Most cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations focus
their computational effort on the galaxies themselves and treat the CGM more
coarsely, which means small-scale structure cannot be resolved. We get around
this issue by running zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with
standard mass refinement and additional uniform spatial refinement within the
virial radius. This results in a detailed view of its gaseous halo at
unprecedented (1 kpc) uniform resolution with only a moderate increase in
computational time. The improved spatial resolution does not impact the central
galaxy or the average density of the CGM. However, it drastically changes the
radial profile of the neutral hydrogen column density, which is enhanced at
galactocentric radii larger than 40 kpc. The covering fraction of Lyman-Limit
Systems within 150 kpc is almost doubled. We therefore conclude that some of
the observational properties of the CGM are strongly resolution dependent.
Increasing the resolution in the CGM, without increasing the resolution of the
galaxies, is a promising and computationally efficient method to push the
boundaries of state-of-the-art simulations.

infrared luminosity function at $z$$\sim$2. We also present the currently most
reliable measurement of the cosmic density of cold gas in galaxies at early
epochs, i.e., the cold gas history of the universe, as determined over a large
cosmic volume of $\sim$375,000 Mpc$^3$. Our measurements are in agreement with
an increase of the cold gas density from $z$$\sim$0 to $z$$\sim$2-3, followed
by a possible decline towards $z$$\sim$5-7. These findings are consistent with
recent surveys based on higher-$J$ CO line measurements, upon which COLDz
improves in terms of statistical uncertainties by probing $\sim$50-100 times
larger areas and in the reliability of total gas mass estimates by probing the
low-$J$ CO lines accessible to the VLA. Our results thus appear to suggest that
the cosmic star-formation rate density follows an increased cold molecular gas

decline towards the earliest epochs is likely related to a lower overall amount
of cold molecular gas (as traced by CO) bound in galaxies towards the first

the consequences of seeding SMBHs with direct collapse BHs (DCBHs)
($M_{\bullet}=10^{4-6}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$) on proto-galactic disc growth. We
show that even in the absence of direct feedback effects, the growth of seed
BHs reduces the development of gravitational instabilities in host galaxy
discs, suppressing star formation and confining stars to a narrow ring in the
disc and leading to galaxies at $z \sim 6$ which lie above the local BH-stellar
mass relation. The relative magnitude of cosmic and BH accretion rates governs
the evolution of the BH-stellar mass relation. For typical DCBH formation
epochs, $z_{\rm{i}} \sim 10$, we find star formation is inhibited in haloes
growing at the average rate predicted by $\Lambda$CDM which host BHs capable of
reaching $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ by $z\gtrsim6$. Slower
growing BHs cause a delay in the onset of star formation; a $M_{\bullet} \sim
10^6 $ M$_{\odot}$ seed growing at $0.25$ times the Eddington limit will delay
star formation by $\sim100$ Myr. This delay is reduced by a factor of $\sim10$
if the halo growth rate is increased by $\sim 0.6\, \sigma$. Our results
suggest that SMBHs seeded by DCBHs and their host galaxies form in separate
progenitor haloes. In the absence of subsequent mergers, higher than average
cosmic accretion or earlier seed formation ($z_{\rm i} \sim 20$) are required
to place the evolving BH on the local BH-stellar mass relation by $z=6$.

erosion of a segmentation image. The segmentation image is displayed with
random RGB triplets to ensure adjacent regions are readily discernible, whereas
the direct image is shown as an inverted greyscale with controls for brightness

component of MPTCP is the scheduler that decides which subflow to use for each
packet. Existing schedulers typically use estimates of end-to-end path
properties, such as delay and bandwidth, for making the scheduling decisions.
In this paper, we show that these scheduling decisions can be significantly
improved by incorporating readily available local information from the device
driver queues in the decision-making process. We propose QAware, a novel
cross-layer approach for MPTCP scheduling. QAware combines end-to-end delay
estimates with local queue buffer occupancy information and allows for a better
and faster adaptation to the network conditions. This results in more efficient
use of the available resources and considerable gains in aggregate throughput.
We present the design of QAware and evaluate its performance through

schedulers. Our results show that QAware performs significantly better than
other available approaches for various use-cases and applications.

of research, with a potentially long list of important application. Yet, the
study of emotion requires knowing which facial expressions are used within and
across cultures in the wild, not in controlled lab conditions; but such studies
do not exist. Which and how many cross-cultural and cultural-specific facial
expressions do people commonly use? And, what affect variables does each
expression communicate to observers? If we are to design technology that
understands the emotion of users, we need answers to these two fundamental
questions. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of the
production and visual perception of facial expressions of emotion in the wild.
We find that of the 16,384 possible facial configurations that people can
theoretically produce, only 35 are successfully used to transmit emotive
information across cultures, and only 8 within a smaller number of cultures.
Crucially, we find that visual analysis of cross-cultural expressions yields
consistent perception of emotion categories and valence, but not arousal. In
contrast, visual analysis of cultural-specific expressions yields consistent
perception of valence and arousal, but not of emotion categories. Additionally,
we find that the number of expressions used to communicate each emotion is also
different, e.g., 17 expressions transmit happiness, but only 1 is used to
convey disgust.

assess model performance, and find that our proposed method results in reduced

our models to reconstruct past changes in genetic diversity of human hepatitis

fundamental representation are `level-rank' dual to CS gauged critical fermions
also in the fundamental representation. Generic relevant deformations of these
conformal field theories lead to one of two distinct massive phases. In
previous work, the large $N$ thermal free energy for the bosonic theory in the
unHiggsed phase has been demonstrated to match the corresponding fermionic
results under duality. In this note we evaluate the large $N$ thermal free
energy of the bosonic theory in the Higgsed phase and demonstrate that our
results, again, perfectly match the predictions of duality. Our computation is
performed in a unitary gauge by integrating out the physical excitations of the
theory - i.e. W bosons - at all orders in the 't Hooft coupling. Our results
allow us to construct an exact quantum effective potential for ${\bar \phi}
\phi$, the lightest gauge invariant scalar operator in the theory. In the zero
temperature limit this exact Landau-Ginzburg potential is non-analytic at
${\bar \phi \phi}=0$. The extrema of this effective potential at positive
${\bar \phi}\phi$ solve the gap equations in the Higgsed phase while the
extrema at negative ${\bar \phi} \phi$ solve the gap equations in the unHiggsed
phase. Our effective potential is bounded from below only for a certain range
of $x_6$ (the parameter that governs sextic interactions of $\phi$). This
observation suggests that the regular boson theory has a stable vacuum only
when $x_6$ lies in this range.

of the most credible identification strategies for program evaluation and
causal inference. However, RD treatment effect estimands are necessarily local,
making statistical methods for the extrapolation of these effects a key area
for development. We introduce a new method for extrapolation of RD effects that
relies on the presence of multiple cutoffs, and is therefore design-based. Our
approach employs an easy-to-interpret identifying assumption that mimics the
idea of ""common trends"" in difference-in-differences designs. We illustrate our
methods with data on a subsidized loan program on post-education attendance in
Colombia, and offer new evidence on program effects for students with test
scores away from the cutoff that determined program eligibility.

minimum turn cost. Questions of this type have been studied in the past, with
complexity and approximation results as well as open problems dating back to
work by Arkin et al. in 2001. A wide spectrum of practical applications have
renewed the interest in these questions, and spawned variants: for full
coverage, every point has to be covered, for subset coverage, specific points
have to be covered, and for penalty coverage, points may be left uncovered by
incurring an individual penalty.
  We make a number of contributions. We first show that finding a minimum-turn
(full) cycle cover is NP-hard even in 2-dimensional grid graphs, solving the
long-standing open Problem 53 in The Open Problems Project edited by Demaine,
Mitchell and O'Rourke. We also prove NP-hardness of finding a subset cycle
cover of minimum turn cost in thin grid graphs, for which Arkin et al. gave a
polynomial-time algorithm for full coverage; this shows that their boundary
techniques cannot be applied to compute exact solutions for subset and penalty
variants.
  On the positive side, we establish the first constant-factor approximation
algorithms for all considered subset and penalty problem variants, making use
of LP/IP techniques. For full coverage in more general grid graphs (e.g.,
hexagonal grids), our approximation factors are better than the combinatorial
ones of Arkin et al. Our approach can also be extended to other geometric
variants, such as scenarios with obstacles and linear combinations of turn and
distance costs.

demonstrate that the uncertainties returned by our method are a realistic
estimate of the precision and they automatically blow up when inputs or outputs

extrapolation. By using standard deep-learning tools for GPU acceleration, our
method is extremely fast, allowing analysis of the entire APOGEE data set of

conversion for applications such as radio-over-fiber, synchronization at

Photodetector nonlinearity is a particularly vexing problem, causing signal
distortion and excess noise, especially in systems utilizing ultrashort optical
pulses. Here we show that photodetectors designed for high power handling and
high linearity can perform optical-to-electrical conversion of ultrashort
optical pulses with unprecedented linearity over a large photocurrent range. We
also show that the broadband, complex impedance of the circuit following the
photodiode modifies the linearity significantly. By externally manipulating the
circuit impedance, we extend the detector's linear range to higher
photocurrents, with over 50 dB rejection of amplitude-to-phase conversion for
photocurrents up to 40 mA. This represents a 1000-fold improvement over
state-of-the-art photodiodes and significantly extends the attainable microwave
power by a factor of four. As such, we eliminate the long-standing requirement
in ultrashort pulse detection of precise tuning of the photodiode's operating
parameters (average photocurrent, bias voltage or temperature) to coincide with
a nonlinearity minimum. These results should also apply more generally to
reduce nonlinear distortion in a range of other microwave photonics
applications.

distribution networks. On one hand, although several types of HIF models are
available for HIF study, they are still not exhibiting satisfactory fault
waveforms. On the other hand, utilizing historical data has been a trend
recently for using machine learning methods to improve HIF detection.
Nonetheless, most proposed methodologies address the HIF issue starting with
investigating a limited group of features and can hardly provide a practical
and implementable solution. This paper, however, proposes a systematic design
of feature extraction, based on an HIF detection and classification method. For
example, features are extracted according to when, how long, and what magnitude
the fault events create. Complementary power expert information is also
integrated into the feature pools. Subsequently, we propose a ranking procedure
in the feature pool for balancing the information gain and the complexity to
avoid over-fitting. For implementing the framework, we create an HIF detection
logic from a practical perspective. Numerical methods show the proposed HIF
detector has very high dependability and security performance under multiple
fault scenarios comparing with other traditional methods.

have been used to investigate the role of various mechanical and biological
factors on the bone healing. However, the initial phase of healing, which
includes the inflammatory response, the granulation tissue formation and the
initial callus formation during the first few days post-fracture, are generally
neglected in such studies. In this study, we developed a finite-element-based
model to simulate different levels of diffusion coefficient for mesenchymal
stem cell (MSC) migration, Young's modulus of granulation tissue, callus
thickness and interfragmentary gap size to understand the modulatory effects of
these initial phase parameters on bone healing. The results showed that faster
MSC migration, stiffer granulation tissue, thicker callus and smaller
interfragmentary gap enhanced healing to some extent. After a certain
threshold, a state of saturation was reached for MSC migration rate,
granulation tissue stiffness and callus thickness. Therefore, a parametric
study was performed to verify that the callus formed at the initial phase, in
agreement with experimental observations, has an ideal range of geometry and
material properties to have the most efficient healing time. Findings from this
paper quantified the effects of the healing initial phase on healing outcome to
better understand the biological and mechanobiological mechanisms and their
utilization in the design and optimization of treatment strategies. Simulation
outcomes also demonstrated that for fractures, where bone segments are in close
proximity, callus development is not required. This finding is consistent with
the concepts of primary and secondary bone healing.

formation of the nonuniform state in which the order parameter is periodically
modulated along the magnetic field, i.e., between the layers
(Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov [FFLO] state). The conventional uniform state
experiences such a quantization-induced FFLO instability at low temperatures
even in a common case of predominantly orbital suppression of superconductivity
when the Zeeman spin splitting is expected to have a relatively weak effect.
The maximum relative FFLO temperature is given by the ratio of the
superconducting transition temperature and the Fermi energy. This maximum is
realized when the ratio of the spin-spitting energy and the Landau-level
separation is half-integer. These results imply that the FFLO states may exist
not only in the Pauli-limited superconductors but also in very clean materials
with small Zeeman spin-splitting energy. We expect that the described

found in materials with different electronic spectra and order-parameter

downward band bending which spans most of the Ge gap. This strong downward band

flat despite the space-charge layer therein. Inclusion of the effect of Ge band

outcome of this competition depends sensitively on the average resource

$\overline{V}>1$, there is one winner only and that winner eventually scavenges
all or most of the resource. In the socio-economic realm this is is known as
the ""winner-take-all"" outcome: A disproportionately large reward falls to one
or a few winners, even though other competitors start out with comparable (or
even slightly more) resource and perform only marginally worse. The losing
competitors are not rewarded. For less than abundant resource,
$\overline{V}<1$, an outcome with resource that is evenly partitioned amongst
the $N$ droplets becomes possible. This is the ""all-share-evenly"" or
egalitarian outcome. For sufficiently scarce resource the egalitarian outcome
is the only one that can occur. In addition to predicting what kind and how
many winners, our analysis shows that once an individual's resource (droplet
volume) falls below a fixed threshold, that individual can neither recover nor
emerge as winner. This is the ""once down-and-out, always down-and-out"" outcome.
Selected simulations suggest that the winner depends sensitively on population
size and the ""trading friction"" or inefficiency of resource exchange between
individuals (liquid rheology). Of all feasible rest states (equilibria), only
certain ones are reachable (stable equilibria). Friction turns out to strongly
influence the time to reach an end state (stable equilibrium), in surprising
ways. Besides the end states, our analysis reveals an array of rest states,
ordered in hierarchies of more versus less costly (energetic) outcomes.

loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm $\|\cdot\|$ associated
with the kernel). We first test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of
recovering the Green's function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous
coefficients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we
consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the
form $K_1(F_n(x),F_n(x'))$ with $F_{n+1}=(I_d+\epsilon G_{n+1})\circ F_n$ and
$G_{n+1} \in \operatorname{Span}\{K_1(F_n(x_i),\cdot)\}$. With the proposed
approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic
data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep
(bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks
learn by constructing flow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental
data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative
counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can
achieve accurate classification from only one data point per class (2) appear
to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are
in different classes and contract distances between points in the same class.
For kernels parameterized by the weights of Convolutional Neural Networks,
minimizing approximation errors incurred by halving random subsets of
interpolation points, appears to outperform training (the same CNN
architecture) with relative entropy and dropout.

has many favorable features including a probable increase in natural period of
the soil-structure system and also a decrease in shear base demand in
structures. Furthermore, Rocking is one of the most important factors in
describing the rotational behavior of a structure built on a shallow foundation
especially on a soft soil which can affect the dynamic behavior of the
structure noticeably. To study the effects of rocking of shallow foundations
subjected to slow cyclic loading with consideration of soil-structure
interaction, a Finite Element Method (FEM) using ABAQUS software has been
deployed to simulate the rocking motion of shallow foundations. For a more
efficient simulation of the soil, both linear and non-linear elasto-plastic
behavior of the soil has been taken into account in the analysis using the
sub-routine coded in FORTRAN. The results notably show that allowing the
foundation to rock may result in stiffness degradation of the soil-structure
system and an increase in energy dissipation of soil-structure, especially in
high rise structures. Additionally, results describe that deploying the linear
elastic-perfect plastic approach may result in higher uplift of the foundation
in comparison to that using a non-linear elasto-plastic approach, particularly
in structures with lower heights.

telescopes, coupled to an additional 30,000+ detectors, all of which will be
located in the Atacama Desert at an altitude of 5190 m. The powerful
combination of large and small apertures in a CMB observatory will allow us to
sample a wide range of angular scales over a common survey area. SO will
measure fundamental cosmological parameters of our universe, constrain
primordial fluctuations, find high redshift clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel`dovich
effect, constrain properties of neutrinos, and trace the density and velocity
of the matter in the universe over cosmic time. The complex set of technical
and science requirements for this experiment has led to innovative
instrumentation solutions which we will discuss. The large aperture telescope
will couple to a cryogenic receiver that is 2.4 m in diameter and nearly 3 m
long, creating a number of technical challenges. Concurrently, we are designing
the array of cryogenic receivers housing the 42 cm aperture telescopes. We will

based on analysis of high-order joint moments. Using kurtosis as a reliable
measure of outliers, we suggest that principal kurtosis vectors, by analogy to
principal component analysis (PCA) vectors, signify the principal directions
along which outliers appear. The inception of an anomaly, then, manifests as a
change in the principal values and vectors of kurtosis. Obtaining the principal
kurtosis vectors requires decomposing a fourth order joint cumulant tensor for
which we use a simple, computationally less expensive approach that involves
performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) over the matricized tensor. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on synthetic data, and develop an
algorithm to identify the occurrence of a spatial and/or temporal anomalous
event in scientific phenomena. The algorithm decomposes the data into several
spatial sub-domains and time steps to identify regions with such events.
Feature moment metrics, based on the alignments of the principal kurtosis
vectors, are computed at each sub-domain and time step for all features to
quantify their relative importance towards the overall kurtosis in the data.
Accordingly, spatial and temporal anomaly metrics for each sub-domain are
proposed using the Hellinger distance of the feature moment metric distribution
from a suitable nominal distribution. We apply the algorithm to a
one-dimensional turbulent auto-ignition combustion case and demonstrate that
the anomaly metrics reliably capture the occurrence of auto-ignition in
relevant spatial sub-domains at the right time steps.

presence of life etc.) by studying material ejected from the surface during an
impact event. For given parameters characterising the impact event, we estimate
the escaping mass and assess its subsequent collisional evolution in a
circumstellar orbit, assuming a Sun-like host star. We calculate the fractional
luminosity of the dust as a function of time after the impact event and study
its detectability with current and future instrumentation. We consider the
possibility to constrain the dust composition, giving information on the
geology or the presence of a biosphere. As examples, we investigate whether
calcite, silica or ejected microorganisms could be detected. For a 20 km
diameter impactor, we find that the dust mass escaping the exoplanet is roughly
comparable to the zodiacal dust. The collisional evolution is best modelled by
considering two independent dust populations, a spalled population consisting
of non-melted ejecta evolving on timescales of millions of years, and dust
recondensed from melt or vapour evolving on much shorter timescales. While the
presence of dust can potentially be inferred with current telescopes, studying
its composition requires advanced instrumentation not yet available. The direct
detection of biological matter turns out to be extremely challenging. Despite
considerable difficulties (small dust masses, noise such as exozodiacal dust

concept abstraction, especially for fine-grained categories. For example, birds
(Aves) can be categorized according to a four-level hierarchy of order, family,
genus, and species. This hierarchy encodes rich correlations among various
categories across different levels, which can effectively regularize the
semantic space and thus make prediction less ambiguous. However, previous
studies of fine-grained image recognition primarily focus on categories of one
certain level and usually overlook this correlation information. In this work,
we investigate simultaneously predicting categories of different levels in the
hierarchy and integrating this structured correlation information into the deep
neural network by developing a novel Hierarchical Semantic Embedding (HSE)
framework. Specifically, the HSE framework sequentially predicts the category
score vector of each level in the hierarchy, from highest to lowest. At each
level, it incorporates the predicted score vector of the higher level as prior
knowledge to learn finer-grained feature representation. During training, the
predicted score vector of the higher level is also employed to regularize label
prediction by using it as soft targets of corresponding sub-categories. To
evaluate the proposed framework, we organize the 200 bird species of the
Caltech-UCSD birds dataset with the four-level category hierarchy and construct
a large-scale butterfly dataset that also covers four level categories.
Extensive experiments on these two and the newly-released VegFru datasets

flight trajectory who optimizes its SR performance by dynamically adjusting its
beamforming vectors and power allocation (PA) strategy. Per fixed time interval
during the Bob's flight process, the transmit beamforming vectors for useful
messages and AN projection are given by the rule of maximizing
signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (Max-SLNR) and maximizing
AN-and-leakage-to-noise ratio (ANLNR), and the optimal PA strategy is based on
maximizing SR (Max-SR). More importantly, an alternating iterative structure
(AIS) between beamforming and PA is proposed to further improve the SR
performance. Simulation results show that the proposed AIS converges rapidly,
and can achieve substantial SR gains over Max-SLNR plus Max-ANLNR with fixed PA
such as PA factor $\beta=$ 0.5, and 0.9. In particular, in the case of
small-scale antenna array, the SR performance gain achieved by the proposed AIS
is more attractive. Additionally, as the number of antennas tends to be

on average. However, randomizing units to treatment and control often leads to
covariate imbalances in realization, and such imbalances can inflate the
variance of estimators of the treatment effect. One solution to this problem is
rerandomization---an experimental design strategy that randomizes units until
some balance criterion is fulfilled---which yields more precise estimators of
the treatment effect if covariates are correlated with the outcome. Most
rerandomization schemes in the literature utilize the Mahalanobis distance,
which may not be preferable when covariates are correlated or vary in
importance. As an alternative, we introduce an experimental design strategy
called ridge rerandomization, which utilizes a modified Mahalanobis distance
that addresses collinearities among covariates and automatically places a
hierarchy of importance on the covariates according to their eigenstructure.
This modified Mahalanobis distance has connections to principal components and
the Euclidean distance, and---to our knowledge---has remained unexplored. We
establish several theoretical properties of this modified Mahalanobis distance
and our ridge rerandomization scheme. These results guarantee that ridge
rerandomization is preferable over randomization and suggest when ridge
rerandomization is preferable over standard rerandomization schemes. We also
provide simulation evidence that suggests that ridge rerandomization is
particularly preferable over typical rerandomization schemes in
high-dimensional or high-collinearity settings.

identify two groups of BBH mergers: a primordial group whose formation does not
depend on cluster's dynamics and a dynamical group whose formation is driven by
the cluster's dynamical evolution. We show how the BBH origin affects the BBH
mergers' main properties such as the chirp mass and merging time distributions.
We provide analytic expressions for the dependence of the number of BBH mergers
from individual GCs on the main cluster's structural properties and the time
evolution of the merger rates of these BBHs. These expressions provide an
essential ingredient for a general framework allowing to estimate the merger
rate density. Using the relations found in our study, we find a local merger
rate density of 0.18$-$1.8 ${\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for primordial BBH

shapes of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), a low radio-frequency

an assumed beam shape, errors in which can cause absolute and relative flux
density errors, as well as polarisation 'leakage'. This makes understanding the
primary beam of paramount importance, especially for sensitive experiments such
as a measurement of the 21 cm line from the epoch of reionisation (EoR). The
calibration requirements for measuring the EoR 21 cm line are so extreme that
tile to tile beam variations may affect our ability to make a detection.
Measuring the primary beam shape from visibilities alone is challenging, as
multiple instrumental, atmospheric, and astrophysical factors contribute to
uncertainties in the data. Building on the methods of Neben et al. (2015), we
tap directly into the receiving elements of the MWA before any digitisation or
correlation of the signal. Using ORBCOMM satellite passes we are able to
produce all-sky maps for 4 separate tiles in the XX polarisation. We find good
agreement with the cutting-edge 'fully' embedded element (FEE) model of
Sokolowski et al. (2017), and observe that the MWA beamformers consistently
recreate beam shapes to within ~1dB in the reliable areas of our beam maps. We
also clearly observe the effects of a missing dipole from a tile in one of our
beam maps, and show that the FEE model is able to reproduce this modified beam
shape. We end by motivating and outlining additional onsite experiments to
further constrain the primary beam behaviour.

maximally recoverable (MR) LRC offers the best possible blend of such local and
global fault tolerance, guaranteeing recovery from all erasure patterns which
are information-theoretically correctable given the presence of local recovery
groups. In an $(n,r,h,a)$-LRC, the $n$ codeword symbols are partitioned into
$r$ disjoint groups each of which include $a$ local parity checks capable of
locally correcting $a$ erasures.
  MR LRCs have received much attention recently, with many explicit
constructions covering different regimes of parameters. Unfortunately, all
known constructions require a large field size that exponential in $h$ or $a$,
and it is of interest to obtain MR LRCs of minimal possible field size. In this
work, we develop an approach based on function fields to construct MR LRCs. Our
method recovers, and in most parameter regimes improves, the field size of
previous approaches. For instance, for the case of small $r \ll \epsilon \log
n$ and large $h \ge \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, we improve the field size from
roughly $n^h$ to $n^{\epsilon h}$. For the case of $a=1$ (one local parity
check), we improve the field size quadratically from $r^{h(h+1)}$ to $r^{h
\lfloor (h+1)/2 \rfloor}$ for some range of $r$. The improvements are modest,
but more importantly are obtained in a unified manner via a promising new idea.

occurrence coincides in each BP with the convergence and cancellation phase of
the CBP bipole evolution during which the CBPs become smaller until they fully
disappear. The remaining three happen 4 - 6 hrs after the CBP formation. In
sixteen out of 21 eruptions the magnetic convergence and cancellation involve
the CBP main bipoles, while in three eruptions one of the BP magnetic fragments
and a pre-existing fragment of opposite polarity converge and cancel. In one BP
with two eruptions cancellation was not observed. The CBP eruptions involve in
most cases the expulsion of chromospheric material either as elongated
filamentary structure (mini-filament, MF) or a volume of cool material (cool
plasma cloud, CPC), together with the CBP or higher overlying hot loops.
Coronal waves were identified during three eruptions. A micro-flaring is
observed beneath all erupting MFs/CPCs. It remains uncertain whether the
destabilised MF causes the micro-flaring or the destabilisation and eruption of
the MF is triggered by reconnection beneath the filament. In most eruptions,
the cool erupting plasma obscures partially or fully the micro-flare until the

characterized by a scalar spin chirality is often described by the Berry phase,

the coupling, $M$, of conduction electrons to the spin texture is strong
(strong-coupling regime) and the adiabatic condition is satisfied. However, in
the weak-coupling regime, where the coupling $M$ is smaller than the electrons'
scattering rate, the adiabatic condition is not satisfied and the Berry phase
picture does not hold. In such a regime, the relation of the effective magnetic
field to the spin texture can be ""nonlocal"", in contrast to the ""local""
relation in the strong coupling case. Focusing on the case of continuous but
general spin texture, we investigate the THE in various characteristic regions
in the weak-coupling regime, namely, (1) diffusive and local, (2) diffusive and
nonlocal, and (3) ballistic. In the presence of spin relaxation, there arise
two more regions in the ""weakest-coupling"" regime: (1') diffusive and local,
and (2') diffusive and nonlocal. We derived the analytic expression of the
topological Hall conductivity (THC) for each region, and found that the
condition for the locality of the effective field is governed by transverse
spin diffusion of electrons. In region 1, where the spin relaxation is
negligible and the effective field is local, the THC is found to be
proportional to $M$, instead of $M^3$ of the weakest-coupling regime. In the
diffusive, nonlocal regions (2 and 2'), the effective field is given by a spin
chirality formed by ""effective spins"" that the electrons see during their

migration affects the ability to trap multiple planets in a resonant chain near
the inner edge of the protostellar disc. A sharp edge modelled as a hyperbolic
tangent function coupled with supersonic corrections to the classical type I
migration torques results in the innermost planets being pushed inside the
cavity through resonant interaction with farther planets because migration is
starward at slightly supersonic eccentricities. Planets below a few Earth
masses are generally trapped in a resonant chain with the outermost planet near
the disc edge, but long-term stability is not guaranteed. For more massive
planets the migration is so fast that the eccentricity of the innermost
resonant pair is excited to highly supersonic levels due to decreased damping
on the innermost planet as it is pushed inside the cavity; collisions
frequently occur and the system consists one or two intermediate-mass planets
residing closer to the star than the disc's inner edge. We found a neat pileup
of resonant planets outside the disc edge only if the corotation torque does
not rapidly diminish at high eccentricity. We call for detailed studies on
planet migration near the disc's inner edge, which is still uncertain, and for

in value is carried by container ships that transit regular routes on fixed
schedules in the ocean. In the present paper, we analyse a data set of global
liner shipping as a network of ports. In particular, we construct the network
of the ports as the one-mode projection of a bipartite network composed of
ports and ship routes. Like other transportation networks, global liner
shipping networks may have core-periphery structure, where a core and a
periphery are groups of densely and sparsely interconnected nodes,
respectively. Core-periphery structure may have practical implications for
understanding the robustness, efficiency and uneven development of
international transportation systems. We develop an algorithm to detect
core-periphery pairs in a network, which allows one to find core and peripheral
nodes on different scales and uses a configuration model that accounts for the
fact that the network is obtained by the one-mode projection of a bipartite
network. We also found that most ports are core (as opposed to peripheral)
ports and that ports in some countries in Europe, America and Asia belong to a
global core-periphery pair across different scales, whereas ports in other
countries do not.

  2018",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  SciSports is a Dutch startup company specializing in football analytics. This
paper describes a joint research effort with SciSports, during the Study Group
Mathematics with Industry 2018 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The main
challenge that we addressed was to automatically process empirical football
players' trajectories, in order to extract useful information from them. The
data provided to us was two-dimensional positional data during entire matches.
We developed methods based on Newtonian mechanics and the Kalman filter,
Generative Adversarial Nets and Variational Autoencoders. In addition, we
trained a discriminator network to recognize and discern different movement
patterns of players. The Kalman-filter approach yields an interpretable model,
in which a small number of player-dependent parameters can be fit; in theory
this could be used to distinguish among players. The
Generative-Adversarial-Nets approach appears promising in theory, and some
initial tests showed an improvement with respect to the baseline, but the
limits in time and computational power meant that we could not fully explore
it. We also trained a Discriminator network to distinguish between two players
based on their trajectories; after training, the network managed to distinguish
between some pairs of players, but not between others. After training, the
Variational Autoencoders generated trajectories that are difficult to
distinguish, visually, from the data. These experiments provide an indication
that deep generative models can learn the underlying structure and statistics
of football players' trajectories. This can serve as a starting point for
determining player qualities based on such trajectory data.

  Modeled in Kendall's Shape Space","13 pages, 3 figures, Published in British Machine Vision Conference
  2017 (BMVC-2017)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Moving Object Segmentation is a challenging task for jittery/wobbly videos.
For jittery videos, the non-smooth camera motion makes discrimination between
foreground objects and background layers hard to solve. While most recent works
for moving video object segmentation fail in this scenario, our method
generates an accurate segmentation of a single moving object. The proposed
method performs a sparse segmentation, where frame-wise labels are assigned
only to trajectory coordinates, followed by the pixel-wise labeling of frames.
The sparse segmentation involving stabilization and clustering of trajectories
in a 3-stage iterative process. At the 1st stage, the trajectories are
clustered using pairwise Procrustes distance as a cue for creating an affinity
matrix. The 2nd stage performs a block-wise Procrustes analysis of the
trajectories and estimates Frechet means (in Kendall's shape space) of the
clusters. The Frechet means represent the average trajectories of the motion
clusters. An optimization function has been formulated to stabilize the Frechet
means, yielding stabilized trajectories at the 3rd stage. The accuracy of the
motion clusters are iteratively refined, producing distinct groups of
stabilized trajectories. Next, the labels obtained from the sparse segmentation
are propagated for pixel-wise labeling of the frames, using a GraphCut based
energy formulation. Use of Procrustes analysis and energy minimization in
Kendall's shape space for moving object segmentation in jittery videos, is the
novelty of this work. Second contribution comes from experiments performed on a
dataset formed of 20 real-world natural jittery videos, with manually annotated
ground truth. Experiments are done with controlled levels of artificial jitter
on videos of SegTrack2 dataset. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate
the superiority of the proposed method.

attention by the virtue of making use of environment-friendly recyclable
materials and generating non-bleaching colours [1-8]. Recently, it was found
possible to delegate the task of colour printing to laser post-processing that
modifies carefully designed and fabricated nanostructures [9,10]. Here we take
the next crucial step in the development of structural colour printing by
dispensing with preformed nanostructures and using instead near-percolation
metal films atop dielectric-metal sandwiches, i.e., near-percolation plasmonic
reflector arrays. Scanning rapidly (~ 20 {\mu}m/s) across 4-nm-thin island-like
gold films supported by 30-nm-thin silica layers atop 100-nm-thick gold layers
with a strongly focused Ti-sapphire laser beam, while adjusting the average
laser power from 1 to 10 mW, we produce bright colours varying from green to
red by laser-heating-induced merging and reshaping of gold islands. Selection
of strongly heated islands and their reshaping, both originating from the
excitation of plasmonic resonances, are strongly influenced by the polarization
direction of laser illumination, so that the colours produced are well
pronounced only when viewed with the same polarization. Conversely, the laser
colour writing with circular polarizations results in bright
polarization-independent colour images. The fabrication procedure for
near-percolation reflector arrays is exceedingly simple and scalable to mass
production, while the laser-induced modification occurs inherently with the
subwavelength resolution. This unique combination of remarkable features makes
the approach developed for laser colour writing readily amenable for practical
implementation and use in diverse applications ranging from nanoscale
patterning for security marking to large-scale colour printing for decoration.

power systems. Due to the OPF problem's non-convexity, there may exist multiple
local optima. Certifiably obtaining the global solution is important for
certain applications of OPF problems. Many global optimization techniques
compute an optimality gap that compares the achievable objective value
corresponding to the feasible point from a local solution algorithm with the
objective value bound from a convex relaxation technique. Rather than the
traditional practice of completely separating the local solution and convex
relaxation computations, this paper proposes a method that exploits information
from a local solution to speed the computation of an objective value bound
using a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The improvement in
computational tractability comes with the trade-off of reduced tightness for
the resulting objective value bound. Numerical experiments illustrate this
trade-off, with the proposed method being faster but weaker than the SDP
relaxation and slower but tighter than second-order cone programming (SOCP) and
quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for many large test cases.

assumes that observed images can be decomposed into the reflectance and
illumination. Most existing Retinex-based methods have carefully designed
hand-crafted constraints and parameters for this highly ill-posed
decomposition, which may be limited by model capacity when applied in various
scenes. In this paper, we collect a LOw-Light dataset (LOL) containing
low/normal-light image pairs and propose a deep Retinex-Net learned on this
dataset, including a Decom-Net for decomposition and an Enhance-Net for
illumination adjustment. In the training process for Decom-Net, there is no
ground truth of decomposed reflectance and illumination. The network is learned
with only key constraints including the consistent reflectance shared by paired
low/normal-light images, and the smoothness of illumination. Based on the
decomposition, subsequent lightness enhancement is conducted on illumination by
an enhancement network called Enhance-Net, and for joint denoising there is a
denoising operation on reflectance. The Retinex-Net is end-to-end trainable, so
that the learned decomposition is by nature good for lightness adjustment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves visually
pleasing quality for low-light enhancement but also provides a good
representation of image decomposition.

redshift z~<2. Their MIR fluxes are produced by a combination of continuum and
PAH emission features. The PAH features can dominate the total MIR flux, but
are difficult to measure without spectroscopy. We aim to study star-forming
galaxies by using a blind spectroscopic survey at MIR wavelengths to understand
evolution of their star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR up to z~=0.5, by
paying particular attention to their PAH properties. We conducted a
low-resolution (R~=50) slitless spectroscopic survey at 5-13um of 9um
flux-selected sources (>0.3 mJy) around the North Ecliptic Pole with the
Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI. After removing 11 AGN candidates by using
the IRC photometry, we identified 48 PAH galaxies with PAH 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6um
features at z<0.5. The rest-frame optical-MIR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) based on CFHT and AKARI/IRC imaging covering 0.37-18um were produced,
and analysed in conjunction with the PAH spectroscopy. We defined the PAH
enhancement by using the luminosity ratio of the 7.7um PAH feature over the
3.5um stellar component of the SEDs. The rest-frame SEDs of all PAH galaxies
have a universal shape with stellar and 7.7um bumps, except that the PAH
enhancement significantly varies as a function of the PAH luminosities. We
identified a PAH-enhanced population at z~>0.35, whose SEDs and luminosities
are typical of luminous infrared galaxies. They show particularly larger PAH
enhancement at high luminosity, implying that they are vigorous star-forming
galaxies with elevated specific SFR. Our composite starburst model that
combines a very young and optically very thick starburst with a very old
population can successfully reproduce most of their SED characteristics,
although we could not confirm this optically thick component from our spectral
analysis.

evolution of the cosmological models based on classical and phantom scalar
fields with self-action was performed. The phase portraits of the dynamic
systems of classical and phantom fields and their projections to the Poincare
sphere were constructed. It was shown that the phase trajectories of the
corresponding dynamic systems can be split by bifurcation trajectories into 2,4
or 6 different dynamic streams corresponding to different pairwise symmetric
histories of the Universe depending on the parameters of the scalar field's
model. The phase space of such systems becomes multiply connected, the ranges
of negative total effective energy unavailable for motion, getting appear
there. In the case when attracting centers are situated inside these ranges,
the phase trajectories of the classical scalar field in the infinite future
tend to limit cycles, winding onto the boundaries of these ranges. The phase
trajectories of the scalar field, in turn, get away from the boundaries of
ranges with null effective energy and in the infinite future are wound onto one
of the symmetrical focuses (centers). Thus, the situations when the Universe,
in case of classical scalar field, begins its history with the inflation and
ends it up in the Euclidean future, or, in the case of phantom scalar field, in
opposite, has the Euclidian start and proceeds to inflation mode after
anomalous burst of the acceleration, both become possible. The potentials of
scalar fields on the surface of null curvature are distinct from zero and
thereby define a certain vacuum state.

side-channel attacks (SCA) and fault injection attacks (FIA), which are
nowadays important domains of cryptanalysis. DSM needs two linear codes whose
sum is direct and equals a whole space $\Bbb F_q^n$. The minimum distance of
the former code and the dual distance of the latter should be as large as
possible, given their length and dimensions. But the implementation needs in
practice to work with words obtained by appending, to each codeword $y$ of the
latter code, the source word from which $y$ is the encoding.
  Let $\mathcal C_1$ be an $[n, k]$ linear code over the finite field $\Bbb
F_q$ with generator matrix $G$ and let $\mathcal C_2$ be the linear code over
the finite field $\Bbb F_q$ with generator matrix $[G, I_k]$. It is then highly
desired to construct optimal pairs of linear codes satisfying that $d(\mathcal
C_2^\perp)= d(\mathcal C_1^\perp)$. In this paper, we employ the primitive
irreducible cyclic codes to derive two constructions of optimal pairs of linear
codes for resisting SCA and FIA, where the security parameters are determined
explicitly. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that primitive
irreducible cyclic codes are used to construct (optimal) pairs of codes. As a
byproduct, we obtain the weight enumerators of the codes $\mathcal C_1,

Observatory, we examined the time-evolution of magnetic helicity fluxes across
the photosphere during 16 flares with the energy class lower than M5.0. During
the flare in 4 out of 16 events, we found impulsive changes in the helicity
fluxes. This indicates that even the flare with less energy could be associated
with anomalistic transportation of the magnetic helicity across the
photosphere. Accompanying the impulsive helicity fluxes, the poynting fluxes
across the photosphere evolved from positive to negative. As such, the
transportations of magnetic energy across the photosphere were toward solar
interior during these flares. In each of the 4 events, the impulsive change in
the helicity flux was always mainly contributed by abrupt change in horizontal
velocity field on a sunspot located near the flaring polarity inversion line.
The velocity field on each sunspot shows either an obvious vortex patten or an
shearing patten relative to the another magnetic polarity, which tended to
relax the magnetic twist or shear in the corona. During these flares, abrupt
change in the Lorentz force acting on these sunspots were found. The rotational
motions and shearing motions of these sunspots always had the same directions
with the resultant Lorentz forces. These results support the view that the
impulsive helicity transportation during the flare could be driven by the
change in the Lorentz force applied on the photosphere.

feed-forward processing along the student pathway. This strategy has the
benefit of allowing increased generalization possibilities during training,
while remaining fast at testing. Our unsupervised learning algorithm can run
over several generations of student-teacher training. Thus, a group of student
networks trained in the first generation collectively create the teacher at the
next generation. In experiments our method achieves top results on three
current datasets for object discovery in video, unsupervised image segmentation
and saliency detection. At test time the proposed system is fast, being one to
two orders of magnitude faster than published unsupervised methods.

found that the BSS candidates have surface abundances similar to those of stars
on the main-sequence turn-off of M67. Especially the absence of any anomaly in
their carbon abundances seems to support a collisional formation scenario for
these stars. Furthermore, we note that the abundances of the evolved BSSs S1040

particular, they show a depletion in carbon by $\sim0.25$ dex, which could be
either interpreted as the signature of mass transfer or as the product of
stellar evolutionary processes. Finally, we summarise the properties of the
individual BSS stars observed by APOGEE, as derived from their APOGEE spectra

Changing the phase, we observe a characteristic Hofstadter's butterfly pattern

the operations of our societies by connecting and leveraging an enormous number
of distributed devices (e.g., sensors and actuators). One design challenge is
efficient wireless data aggregation (WDA) over tremendous IoT devices. This can
enable a series of IoT applications ranging from latency-sensitive
high-mobility sensing to data-intensive distributed machine learning.
Over-the-air (functional) computation (AirComp) has emerged to be a promising
solution that merges computing and communication by exploiting analogwave
addition in the air. Another IoT design challenge is battery recharging for
dense sensors which can be tackled by wireless power transfer (WPT). The
coexisting of AirComp and WPT in IoT system calls for their integration to
enhance the performance and efficiency of WDA. This motivates the current work
on developing the wirelessly powered AirComp (WP-AirComp) framework by jointly
optimizing wireless power control, energy and (data) aggregation beamforming to
minimize the AirComp error. To derive a practical solution, we recast the
non-convex joint optimization problem into the equivalent outer and inner
sub-problems for (inner) wireless power control and energy beamforming, and
(outer) the efficient aggregation beamforming, respectively. The former is
solved in closed form while the latter is efficiently solved using the
semidefinite relaxation technique. The results reveal that the optimal energy
beams point to the dominant eigen-directions of the WPT channels, and the
optimal power allocation tends to equalize the close-loop (down-link WPT and
up-link AirComp) effective channels of different sensors. Simulation
demonstrates that controlling WPT provides additional design dimensions for
substantially reducing the AirComp error.

promising mode of fast, energy-efficient, and cost-effective package delivery.
A considerable number of works have studied different aspects of drone package
delivery service by a supplier, one of which is delivery planning. However,
existing works addressing the planning issues consider a simple case of perfect
delivery without service interruption, e.g., due to accident which is common
and realistic. Therefore, this paper introduces the joint ground and aerial
delivery service optimization and planning (GADOP) framework. The framework
explicitly incorporates uncertainty of drone package delivery, i.e., takeoff
and breakdown conditions. The GADOP framework aims to minimize the total
delivery cost given practical constraints, e.g., traveling distance limit.
Specifically, we formulate the GADOP framework as a three-stage stochastic
integer programming model. To deal with the high complexity issue of the
problem, a decomposition method is adopted. Then, the performance of the GADOP
framework is evaluated by using two data sets including Solomon benchmark suite
and the real data from one of the Singapore logistics companies. The
performance evaluation clearly shows that the GADOP framework can achieve
significantly lower total payment than that of the baseline methods which do
not take uncertainty into account.

discovering that almost 30 % of the structural knowledge is missing. We
evaluate these formulations on a practical experimentation using a very large
commonsense benchmark obtained from WordNet through its mapping to SUMO. The
results show that the competency of the ontology improves more than 50 % when
reasoning under the CWA. Thus, applying the CWA automatically to FOL ontologies
reduces their ambiguity and more commonsense questions can be answered

whether any point sources were misclassified as distant clusters. Results. Of

turbulent air plumes in a vertically confined space at a Rayleigh number of
$1.24\times 10^{7}$ using theory and direct numerical simulation. On domains of
sufficiently large aspect ratio, the steady state consists of turbulent plumes
penetrating an interface between two layers of approximately uniform buoyancy.
As described by Baines and Turner (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 37, 1969, pp. 51-80),
upon penetrating the interface the flow in each plume becomes forced and
behaves like a constant-momentum jet, due to a reduction in its mean buoyancy
relative to the local environment. To observe the behaviour of the plumes we
partition the domain into sub-domains corresponding to each plume. Domains of
relatively small aspect ratio produce a single primary mean-flow circulation
between the sub-domains that is maintained by entrainment into the plumes. At
larger aspect ratios the mean flow between the sub-domains bifurcates,
indicating the existence of a secondary circulation within each layer
associated with entrainment into the jets. To study the flow's energetics we
use a local definition of available potential energy (APE). For plumes with
Gaussian velocity and buoyancy profiles, the theory we develop suggests that
the kinetic energy dissipation is split equally between the jets and the plumes
and, collectively, accounts for almost half of the input of APE at the
boundaries. In contrast, $1/4$ of the APE dissipation and background potential
energy (BPE) production occurs in the jets, with the remaining $3/4$ occurring
in the plumes. These bulk theoretical predictions agree with observations of
BPE production from simulations to within $1\%$ and form the basis of a
similarity solution that models the vertical dependence of APE dissipation and
BPE production.

$\alpha n$ for some $\alpha<1$. We want to increase the complexity of $x$ by
changing a small fraction of bits in $x$. This is always possible: Buhrman,
Fortnow, Newman and Vereshchagin (2005) showed that the increase can be at
least $\delta n$ for large $n$ (where $\delta$ is some positive number that
depends on $\alpha$ and the allowed fraction of changed bits).
  We consider a related question: what happens with the complexity of $x$ when
we randomly change a small fraction of the bits (changing each bit
independently with some probability $\tau$)? It turns out that a linear
increase in complexity happens with high probability, but this increase is
smaller than in the case of arbitrary change. We note that the amount of the
increase depends on $x$ (strings of the same complexity could behave
differently), and give an exact lower and upper bounds for this increase (with
$o(n)$ precision).

affine dynamic systems. In this type of systems, the high-frequency gain matrix
(HFGM), which is the matrix multiplying the control vector in the dynamic
equation of the sliding variables vector, is neither deterministic nor positive
definite. This case has rarely been covered by general SMC methods, which
perform well under the condition that the HFGM is certain or uncertain but
positive definite. In this study, the control law is determined by solving a
nonlinear vector equation instead of the conventional algebraic expression,
which is not applicable when the HFGM is uncertain and non-positive definite.
Theorems with some relaxed system parametric uncertainty assumptions are
proposed to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution, and proofs
of them, based on the principle of the convex cone set, are given in the text.
The proposed control strategy can be easily applied in practice, and the
chattering caused by the discontinuous control can be suppressed, as it can in
general SMCs. The proposed controller was used in two affine dynamic systems,
and the simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness.

universe. In active galactic nuclei (AGN) the origin and role of dust are
uncertain. Here, we have studied dust in the X-ray bright and reddened type-1
quasar IC 4329A, which exhibits an ionised AGN wind. We incorporated
high-resolution X-ray and mid-IR spectroscopy, combined with broad-band
continuum modelling, to investigate the properties of dust in this AGN. We used
new Chandra HETGS observations taken in June 2017, as well as archival data
from XMM-Newton, Swift, HST, Spitzer, IRAS, and Herschel for our
IR-optical-UV-X-ray modelling. Two distinct components of dust in IC 4329A are
found. One component is in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy,
and the other is a nuclear component in the AGN torus and its associated wind.
The emitting dust in the torus is evident in mid-IR emission (9.7 and 18 micron
features), while dust in the wind is present through both reddening and X-ray
absorption (O, Si, and Fe edge features). The gas depletion factors into dust
for O, Si, and Fe are measured. We derive an intrinsic reddening E(B-V) ~ 1.0,
which is most consistent with a grey (flat) extinction law. The AGN wind
consists of three ionisation components. From analysis of long-term changes in
the wind, we determine limits on the location of the wind components. The two
lowest ionisation components are likely carriers of dust from the AGN torus. We
find that the dust in the nuclear component of IC 4329A is different from dust
in the Milky Way. The dust grains in the AGN torus and wind are likely larger
than the standard Galactic dust, and are in a porous composite form (containing
amorphous silicate with iron and oxygen). This can be a consequence of grain
coagulation in the dense nuclear environment of the AGN.

revealed by analysis of bond reorganization reactions and is based on the
interplay of two processes. The first one is breaking of bonds between 3 zigzag
atomic rows leading to triple chain formation. The second one is bond breaking
within the same zigzag atomic row, which occurs predominantly through
generation of pentagons with subsequent bond breaking in pentagons and results
in single or double chain formation. The DFT calculations of the barriers for

We find that for certain classes of the MWI schemes with scale factors that are

maximally entangled probes \emph{decreases} with increasing the particle number
$N$, for both independent and collective dephasing situations. This result
challenges the conventional wisdom found in dephasing Ramsey-type

precision of multiqubit Sagnac atom interferometry for rotation sensing. And we
show that due to the competition between the unconventional interrogation-time
quadratic phase accumulation and the exponential dephasing processes, the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which is the optimal input state in
noiseless scenarios, leads to vanishing quantum Fisher information in the
large-$N$ regime. Then our assessments are further extended to generic MWI
schemes for quantum sensing with entangled states and under decoherence.

state transfer between distant memory nodes using photon-number superposition
states (PNSS). In the suggested scheme, the quantum nodes are single atoms
confined in high-finesse optical cavities linked by photonic channels. The
quantum information written in a superposition of atomic Zeeman states of
sending system is faithfully mapped through cavity-assisted Raman scattering
onto PNSS of linearly polarized cavity photons. The photons travel to the
receiving cavity, where they are coherently absorbed with unit probability
creating the same superposition state of the second atom, thus ensuring
high-fidelity transfer between distant nodes. We develop this approach at first
for photonic qubit and show that this superposition state is no less reliably
protected against the propagation losses compared to the single-photon
polarization states, whereas the limitation associated with the delivery of
more than one photon does not affect the process fidelity. Then, by preserving
the advantages of qubits, we extend the developed technique to the case of
state transfer by photonic qutrit, which evidently possesses more information
capacity. This reliable and efficient scheme promises also a successful
distribution of entanglement over long distances in quantum networks.

These two fundamental phenomena form the basis of fabricating various wave
components. Specifically, refraction, dubbed positive refraction nowadays,
appears in the opposite side of the interface normal with respect to the
incidence. Negative refraction, emerging in the same side by contrast, has been
observed in artificial materials1-5 following a prediction by Veslago6, which
has stimulated many fascinating applications such as super-resolution imaging7.
Here we report the first discovery of negative refraction of the topological
surface arc states of Weyl crystals, realized for airborne sound in a novel
woodpile phononic crystal. The interfaces are one-dimensional edges that
separate different crystal facets. By tailoring the surface terminations of
such a Weyl phononic crystal, open equifrequency contours of surface acoustic
waves can be delicately designed to produce the negative refraction, to
contrast the positive counterpart realized in the same sample. Strikingly
different from the conventional interfacial phenomena, the unwanted reflection
can be made forbidden by exploiting the open nature of the surface
equifrequency contours, which is a topologically protected surface hallmark of
Weyl crystals8-12.

a priori as in variants of Augmented Lagrangian methods (ALM). We prove
$\BigO{\frac{1}{k}}$-convergence rate on the last iterate of the outer sequence

which are common in ALM as well as alternating direction method-of-multipliers
literature. Compared to existing inexact ALM or quadratic penalty methods, our
analysis does not rely on the worst-case bounds of the subproblem solved by the
inner loop. Therefore, our algorithm can be viewed as a restarting technique
applied to the ASGARD method in \cite{TranDinh2015b} but with rigorous
theoretical guarantees or as an inexact ALM with explicit inner loop
termination rules and adaptive parameters. Our algorithm only requires to
initialize the parameters once, and automatically update them during the
iteration process without tuning. We illustrate the superiority of our methods

cumulative photon dose absorbed by the YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ samples. The
light-induced changes in the Raman spectra exhibit a stretched-exponential time

They also depend strongly on doping and are most pronounced for $x \sim 0.6$.
In fully illuminated samples, the mode intensities exhibit a monotonic
temperature dependence indicative of a second-order phase transition. The
findings indicate a metastable state generated by light-induced rearrangement
of the oxygen dopants. We hypothesize that the new Raman phonons are associated

continuous-wave light pumped second harmonic generation (SHG) in AlGaAs NWs by

excitation with a pump power down to ~3 uW, and the cavity-enhancement factor
is estimated around 150. Additionally, in the integrated device, the NW's SHG
is more than two-order of magnitude stronger than third harmonic generations in
the silicon slab, though the NW only couple s with less than 1% of the cavity

conversion would promote NW-based building blocks for nonlinear optics,

it may not be suitable for heterogeneous network because in heterogeneous
networks two adjacent nodes often belong to different types. Therefore, this
paper proposes a K-hop random walk based sampling approach which includes a
node in the sample list only if it is separated by K hops from the source node.
We exploit the samples generated using K-hop random walker for network
embedding using skip-gram model (word2vec). Thereafter, the performance of
network embedding is evaluated on co-authorship prediction task in
heterogeneous DBLP network. We compare the efficacy of network embedding
exploiting proposed sampling approach with recently proposed best performing
network embedding models namely, Metapath2vec and Node2vec. It is evident that
the proposed sampling approach yields better quality of embeddings and

self gravitating compact objects, called axion stars (ASs). In this work, we
study for the first time head-on collisions of relativistic ASs with black
holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). In the case of BH-AS mergers we find that,
in general, the largest scalar clouds are produced by mergers of low
compactness ASs and spinning BHs. Although in most of the cases which we study
the majority of the mass is absorbed by the BH within a short time after the
merger, in favourable cases the remaining cloud surrounding the final BH
remnant can be as large as 30% of the initial axion star mass, with a bosonic
cloud mass of order ~ 0.1 M_BH and peak energy density comparable to that
obtained in a superradiant build up. This provides a dynamical mechanism for
the formation of long lived scalar hair, which could lead to observable signals
in cases where the axion interacts with baryonic matter around the BH, or where
it forms the seed of a future superradiant build up in highly spinning cases.
Considering NS-AS collisions we find two possible final states (i) a BH
surrounded by a (small) scalar cloud, or (ii) a stable NS enveloped in an axion
cloud of roughly the same mass as the initial AS. Whilst for low mass ASs the
NS is only mildly perturbed by the collision, a larger mass AS gives rise to a
massive ejection of baryonic mass from the system, purely due to gravitational
effects. Therefore, even in the absence of a direct axion coupling to baryonic
matter, NS-AS collisions could give rise to electromagnetic observables in
addition to their gravitational wave signatures.

explicit time stepping methods. We use the third order strong-stability
preserving Runge-Kutta method in our numerical experiments. Our spatial
discretization produces the {\it identical} velocity field as the

  Due to the global nature of the divergence-free constraint, there exist no
local bases for our finite element space. We present a key result on the
efficient implementation of the scheme by identifying the equivalence of the
(dense) mass matrix inversion of the globally divergence-free finite element
space to a standard (hybrid-)mixed Poisson solver. Hence, in each time step, a
(hybrid-)mixed Poisson solver is used, which reflects the global nature of the
incompressibility condition. Since we treat viscosity explicitly for the

high-Reynolds number flows so that the CFL constraint is not too restrictive.

inherent trade-off in the selection and timing of lab tests between
considerations of the expected utility in clinical decision-making of a given
test at a specific time, and the associated cost or risk it poses to the
patient. In this work, we introduce a framework that learns policies for
ordering lab tests which optimizes for this trade-off. Our approach uses batch
off-policy reinforcement learning with a composite reward function based on
clinical imperatives, applied to data that include examples of clinicians
ordering labs for patients. To this end, we develop and extend principles of
Pareto optimality to improve the selection of actions based on multiple reward
function components while respecting typical procedural considerations and
prioritization of clinical goals in the ICU. Our experiments show that we can
estimate a policy that reduces the frequency of lab tests and optimizes timing
to minimize information redundancy. We also find that the estimated policies
typically suggest ordering lab tests well ahead of critical onsets--such as
mechanical ventilation or dialysis--that depend on the lab results. We evaluate
our approach by quantifying how these policies may initiate earlier onset of
treatment.

assumptions on the underlying data distribution being e.g. Gaussian, or require
the network size and/or training size to be sufficiently large. In this
context, the problem of learning a two-layer ReLU network is approached in a
binary classification setting, where the data are linearly separable and a
hinge loss criterion is adopted. Leveraging the power of random noise
perturbation, this paper presents a novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
algorithm, which can \emph{provably} train any single-hidden-layer ReLU network
to attain global optimality, despite the presence of infinitely many bad local
minima, maxima, and saddle points in general. This result is the first of its
kind, requiring no assumptions on the data distribution, training/network size,
or initialization. Convergence of the resultant iterative algorithm to a global
minimum is analyzed by establishing both an upper bound and a lower bound on
the number of non-zero updates to be performed. Moreover, generalization
guarantees are developed for ReLU networks trained with the novel SGD
leveraging classic compression bounds. These guarantees highlight a key
difference (at least in the worst case) between reliably learning a ReLU
network as well as a leaky ReLU network in terms of sample complexity.
Numerical tests using both synthetic data and real images validate the
effectiveness of the algorithm and the practical merits of the theory.

reconstruct molecular orbitals directly from photoemission data using iterative

steps for processing of the photoemission data followed by an improved
iterative phase retrieval procedure and the interpretation of reconstructed
two-dimensional orbital distributions. We address the issue of background
subtraction by suggesting a signal restoration routine based on the
maximization of mutual information algorithm and solve the problem of finding
the geometrical center in the reconstruction by using a tight-centered object
support in a two-step phase retrieval procedure. The proposed image processing
and improved phase retrieval procedures are used to reconstruct the highest
occupied molecular orbital of pentacene on Ag(110), using photoemission data
only. The results of the reconstruction agree well with the density functional
theory simulation, modified to comply with the experimental conditions. By
comparison with photoelectron holography, we show that the reconstructed
two-dimensional orbital distribution can be interpreted as a superposition of
the in-focus orbital distribution evaluated at the z = 0 plane and out-of-focus
distributions evaluated at other z = const planes. Three-dimensional molecular
orbital distributions could thus be reconstructed directly from two-dimensional
photoemission data, provided the axial resolution of the imaging system is high
enough.

degree and non-conforming mesh refinement, including multiple hanging nodes per

iterative domain decomposition method which can use element-wise fast solvers

through moment equations, the resulting constraint equations are hierarchical.
We show that, for high frequency problems, a subset of these constraints should
be directly enforced, providing the coarse space in the dual-primal domain
decomposition method. The subset of constraints is chosen based on a dispersion
criterion involving mesh size and wavenumber. By increasing the size of the
coarse space according to this criterion, the number of iterations in the
domain decomposition method depends only weakly on the wavenumber. We
demonstrate this convergence behaviour on standard domain decomposition test

a more efficient process to transfer the cosmic ray energy of jet-inflated

magnetic field lines. Jets and the bubbles they inflate transfer heat to the
ambient gas in cooling flows in cluster of galaxies and in galaxies. The
internal energy of the jet-inflated bubbles is dominate by very hot thermal gas
and/or cosmic rays. Cosmic rays that stream along magnetic field lines that
connect the bubbles with the ICM heat the ICM as their energy is dissipated
there. I find that about half of the cosmic ray energy is dissipated in the
bubbles themselves. I also find that the ICM volume that the cosmic ray
streaming process heats is only about five times as large as the volume of the
bubbles. The outcome of heating by streaming only is that the cosmic rays form
a larger bubble filled with very hot thermal gas. Therefore, there is a
requirement for a more efficient process to transfer the internal energy of the
bubbles to the ICM. I suggest that this process is heating by mixing that
operates very well for both cosmic rays and the very hot thermal gas inside the

wider longitudinal distributions comparing to events with the absence of type
II radio burst or its enhancement (almost associated with small SEP events). It
seems that the signature of type II radio bursts enhancement is a good
discriminator between large SEP and small or none SEP event producers during
CME interactions. The type II radio burst enhancement is more likely to be
generated by CME interactions, with the main CME having larger speed (v),
angular width (WD), mass (m) and kinetic energy (E_k), that taking over the
preceding CMEs which also have higher v, WD, m and E_k, than those preceding
CMEs in CME pairs missing the type II radio bursts or enhancements. Our
analysis also revealed that the intensities of associated SEP events correlate
negatively with the intersection height of the two CMEs. Most of
type-II-enhanced events and SEP events are coincidentally and almost always
made by the fast and wide main CMEs that sweeping fully over a relatively
slower and narrower preceding CMEs. We suggest that a fast CME with enough
energy completely overtaking a relatively narrower preceding CME, especially in
low height, can drive more energetic shock signified by the enhanced type II

usually hard to find. Therefore, starting from a background exact solution with
symmetries, one uses the perturbation theory, which albeit approximately,
provides a lot of information regarding a physical solution. But even this
approximate information comes with a price: the basic premise of a perturbative
solution is that it should be improvable. Namely, by going to higher order
perturbation theory, one should be able to improve and better approximate the
physical problem or the solution. While this is often the case in many theories
and many background solutions, there are important cases where the linear
perturbation theory simply fails for various reasons. This issue is well known
in the context of general relativity through the works that started in the
early 1970s, but it has only been recently studied in modified gravity
theories. This thesis is devoted to the study of linearization instability in

previous photometric samples in the near-ultraviolet (NUV), SN2017erp has
colors similar to the NUV-red category after correcting for Milky Way and host
dust reddening. We find the difference between SN2017erp and the NUV-blue
SN2011fe is not consistent with dust reddening alone but is similar to the SALT
color law, derived from rest-frame UV photometry of higher redshift SNe Ia.
This chromatic difference is dominated by the intrinsic differences in the UV
and only a small contribution from the expected dust reddening. Differentiating
the two can have important consequences for determining cosmological distances
with rest-frame UV photometry. This spectroscopic series is important for
analyzing SNe Ia with intrinsically redder NUV colors. We also show model
comparisons suggesting that metallicity could be the physical difference
between NUV-blue and NUV-red SNe Ia, with emission peaks from reverse
fluorescence near 3000 Angstroms implying a factor of ten higher metallicity in
the upper layers of SN2017erp compared to SN~2011fe. Metallicity estimates are
very model dependent however, and there are multiple effects in the UV. Further
models and UV spectra of SNe Ia are needed to explore the diversity of SNe Ia

hidden system parameters from a set of measurements. Often, the forward process
from parameter- to measurement-space is a well-defined function, whereas the
inverse problem is ambiguous: one measurement may map to multiple different
sets of parameters. In this setting, the posterior parameter distribution,
conditioned on an input measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a
particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task -- so-called
Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Although INNs are not new, they have, so
far, received little attention in literature. While classical neural networks
attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs are able to learn
it jointly with the well-defined forward process, using additional latent
output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Given a specific
measurement and sampled latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides
a full distribution over parameter space. We verify experimentally, on
artificial data and real-world problems from astrophysics and medicine, that
INNs are a powerful analysis tool to find multi-modalities in parameter space,
to uncover parameter correlations, and to identify unrecoverable parameters.

theory which possess an exact supersymmetry require a $U(N)=SU(N)\otimes U(1)$
gauge group. In the naive continuum limit, the $U(1)$ modes trivially decouple
and play no role in the theory. However, at non-zero lattice spacing they
couple to the $SU(N)$ modes and can drive instabilities in the lattice theory.
For example, it is well known that the lattice $U(1)$ theory undergoes a phase
transition at strong coupling to a chirally broken phase. An improved action
that suppresses the fluctuations in the $U(1)$ sector was proposed in
arXiv:1505.03135 . Here, we explore a more aggressive approach to the problem
by adding a term to the action which can entirely suppress the $U(1)$ mode. The
penalty is that the new term breaks the $\mathcal{Q}$-exact lattice
supersymmetry. However, we argue that the term is $1/N^2$ suppressed and the
existence of a supersymmetric fixed point in the planar limit ensures that any
SUSY-violating terms induced in the action possess couplings that also vanish
in this limit. We present numerical results on supersymmetric Ward identities
consistent with this conclusion.

models involves single-site updates, performed with the conditional univariate
distribution of each observation in a sequential manner, whereby a complete
Gibbs iteration may become computationally involved even for moderate samples.
As an alternative, we describe a general way to simulate from MRF models using
Gibbs sampling with ""concliques"" (i.e., groups of non-neighboring
observations). Compared to standard Gibbs sampling, this simulation scheme can
be much faster by reducing Gibbs steps and independently updating all
observations per conclique at once. The speed improvement depends on the number
of concliques relative to the sample size for simulation, and
order-of-magnitude speed increases are possible with many MRF models (e.g.,
having appropriately bounded neighborhoods). We detail the simulation method,
establish its validity, and assess its computational performance through

show that for any given positive switching cost, the solutions of the penalized
equations converge monotonically to those of the QVIs. We estimate the
penalization errors and are able to deduce that the optimal switching regions
are constructed exactly. We further demonstrate that as the switching cost
tends to zero, the QVI degenerates into an equation of HJB type, which is
approximated by the penalized equation at the same order (up to a log factor)

surface is irradiated by an intense laser pulse at a grazing angle, around 80
degrees, a relativistic electron vortex is excited in the near-critical-density
layer after the laser pulse depletion. The vortex structure and dynamics are
studied using particle-in-cell simulations. Due to the asymmetry introduced by
nonuniform background density, the vortex drifts at a constant velocity,
typically 0.2 to 0.3 times the speed of light. The strong magnetic field inside
the vortex leads to significant charge separation; in the corresponding
electric field initially stationary protons can be captured and accelerated to
twice the velocity of the vortex (100-200 MeV). A representative scenario -
with laser intensity of 10^21 W/cm^2 -is discussed: two dimensional simulations
suggest that a quasi-monoenergetic proton beam can be obtained with a mean
energy 140 MeV and an energy spread of about 10%. We derive an analytical
estimate for the vortex velocity in terms of laser and plasma parameters,
demonstrating that the maximum proton energy can be controlled by the incidence

morphological types - like the larger average clustercentric distance of
late-type galaxies - we find an intriguing behavior of early types with

asymmetric phase-space distribution, similar to the late-type galaxies and
different from the early types just one magnitude brighter/fainter.
Furthermore, we find a close phase-space aggregation of early-type dwarfs at
large clustercentric distance and high relative velocity. Nearly all of them
show signatures of disk components and their colors imply stellar ages that are
younger than the population average. They are not located closely together but
spread azimuthally around the cluster center. We show that this is expected
from simulations of an infalling galaxy group that slowly gets dispersed after

standard metrics to compare the performance of automated estimations of street
tree cover using GSV. We apply state-of-the-art deep learning models, and
compare their performance to a previously established benchmark of an
unsupervised method. Our training procedure for deep learning models is novel;
we utilize the abundance of openly available and similarly labelled
street-level image datasets to pre-train our model. We then perform additional
training on a small training dataset consisting of GSV images. We find that
deep learning models significantly outperform the unsupervised benchmark
method. Our semantic segmentation model increased mean intersection-over-union

end-to-end model decreased Mean Absolute Error from 10.04% to 4.67%. We also
employ a recently developed method called gradient-weighted class activation

tree cover area as key features for predicting percentage tree cover. Our paper
provides an example of applying advanced deep learning techniques on a

(i.e., its hyper-parameters) broadly determines the DNN's accuracy and
performance, and is often confidential. Attacking a DNN in the cloud to obtain
its architecture can potentially provide major commercial value. Further,
attaining a DNN's architecture facilitates other, existing DNN attacks.
  This paper presents Cache Telepathy: a fast and accurate mechanism to steal a
DNN's architecture using the cache side channel. Our attack is based on the
insight that DNN inference relies heavily on tiled GEMM (Generalized Matrix
Multiply), and that DNN architecture parameters determine the number of GEMM
calls and the dimensions of the matrices used in the GEMM functions. Such
information can be leaked through the cache side channel.
  This paper uses Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload to attack VGG and ResNet DNNs
running OpenBLAS and Intel MKL libraries. Our attack is effective in helping
obtain the architectures by very substantially reducing the search space of

amplitude of the alignment on the morphology of pair members as well as
filament properties. Methods. We build a galaxy pair catalog requiring $r_p <
100\kpc$ and $\Delta V < 500 \kms $ within redshift $z<0.1$ from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We divided the galaxy pair catalog taking into
account the morphological classification by defining three pair categories
composed by elliptical-elliptical (E-E), elliptical-spiral (E-S) and
spiral-spiral (S-S) galaxies. We use a previously defined catalog of filaments
obtained from SDSS and we select pairs located closer than $1\mpc$ from the
filament spine, which are considered as members of filaments. For these pairs,
we calculate the relative angle between the axis connecting each galaxy, and
the direction defined by the spine of the parent filament.
  Results. We find a statistically significant alignment signal between the
pair axes and the spine of the host filaments consistent with a relative excess
of $ \sim$ 15\% aligned pairs. We obtain that pairs composed by elliptical
galaxies exhibit a stronger alignment, showing a higher alignment signal for
pairs closer than 200 $\kpc$ to the filament spine. In addition, we find that
the aligned pairs are associated with luminous host filaments populated with a
high fraction of elliptical galaxies.

role in driving galactic anisotropic accretion as induced by galaxy pairs

generalization of the classical Johnson scheme. This algebraic structure
underlies certain surprising identities (that do not appear to have been
previously observed) satisfied by the covariance matrices in the Nykamp-Zhao

simplified numerical methods for carrying out the linear algebra required to
implement the SONETS algorithm. We also show that this structure extends

using a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) called an
auxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE). The proposed method has three key features.
First, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and
decoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture
time dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target
speech. Second, it uses an information-theoretic regularization for the model
training to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not
be lost in the conversion process. With regular CVAEs, the encoder and decoder
are free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic
since in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on
controlling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such
situations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training
the encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs
are correctly predicted by the classifier. Third, it avoids producing
buzzy-sounding speech at test time by simply transplanting the spectral details
of the input speech into its converted version. Subjective evaluation
experiments revealed that this simple method worked reasonably well in a
non-parallel many-to-many speaker identity conversion task.

of the very famous but very little known predator-prey model elaborated in the

population dynamics and mathematical ecology, including seasonality, migration,
pollution and more. 1. A short history of modeling 1.1. The Malthusian model.
If the rst scientic view of population growth seems to be that of Leonardo
Fibonacci [2], also called Leonardo of Pisa, whose famous sequence of numbers
was presented in his Liber abaci (1202) as a solution to a population growth
problem, the modern foundations of population dynamics clearly date from Thomas
Robert Malthus [20]. Considering an ideal population consisting of a single
homogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and
any periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable
environment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect
inuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when
unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential
growth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of
individuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is
proportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation :
(1) dN (t) dt = $\epsilon$N (t) where $\epsilon$ is a constant factor of
proportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By
integrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian
growth (see Fig. 1). This law, which does not take into account the limits
imposed by the environment on growth and which is in disagreement with the
actual facts, had a profound inuence on Charles Darwin's work on natural
selection. Indeed, Darwin [1] founded the idea of survival of the ttest on the

to adjust the indoor base station transmit power so that the signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of a user equipment (UE) meets the target
SINR. It does so without the UE having to send power control requests. The SON
fault management algorithm uses RL to improve the performance of an outdoor
base station cluster by resolving faults in the network through configuration
management. Both algorithms exploit measurements from the connected users,
wireless impairments, and relevant configuration parameters to solve a

that our proposed RL based algorithms outperform the industry standards today

and sends time-stamped status update to a destination. The sensor harvests
energy from nature and uses it to power its updating operations. The
destination keeps track of the system status through the successfully received
updates. With the recently introduced information freshness metric ""Age of
Information"" (AoI), our objective is to design optimal online status updating
policy to minimize the long-term average AoI at the destination, subject to the
energy causality constraint at the sensor. Due to the noisy channel between the
sensor and the destination, each transmitted update may be erased with a fixed
probability, and the AoI at the destination will be reset to zero only when an
update is successfully received. We first consider status updating without
feedback available to the sensor and show that the Best-effort Uniform updating
(BU) policy is optimal. We then investigate status updating with perfect
feedback to the sensor and prove the optimality of the Best-effort Uniform
updating with Retransmission (BUR) policy. In order to prove the optimality of
the proposed policies, for each case, we first identify a lower bound on the
long-term average AoI among a broad class of online policies, and then
construct a sequence of virtual policies to approach the lower bound
asymptotically. Since those virtual policies are sub-optimal to the original
policy, the original policy is thus optimal.

demonstrate a biological signal conversion interface that can also be seen as a
microscale modulator. In particular, the proposed interface transduces an
optical signal, which is controlled using an LED, into a chemical signal by
changing the pH of the environment. The modulator is realized using E. coli
bacteria as microscale entity expressing the light-driven proton pump
gloeorhodopsin from Gloeobacter violaceus. Upon inducing external light
stimuli, these bacteria locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting
protons into the environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed
optical-to-chemical signal converter, we analyze the pH signal measured by a pH
sensor, which serves as receiver. We develop an analytical parametric model for
the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied optical signal. Using
this model, we derive a training-based channel estimator which estimates the
parameters of the proposed model to fit the measurement data. We further derive
the optimal maximum likelihood detector and a suboptimal low-complexity
detector to recover the transmitted data from the measured received signal. It
is shown that the proposed parametric model is in good agreement with the
measurement data. Moreover, for an example scenario, we show that the proposed
setup is able to successfully convert an optical signal representing a sequence
of binary symbols into a chemical signal with a bit rate of 1 bit/minute and
recover the transmitted data from the chemical signal using the proposed
estimation and detection~schemes. The proposed modulator may form the basis for
future MC testbeds and applications at microscale.

widespread use and favorable properties, in this paper, we provide a
theoretical study of the potential benefits of magnetic nanoparticles for the
design of molecular communication systems. In particular, we consider magnetic
nanoparticle based communication in a microfluidic channel where an external
magnetic field is employed to attract the information-carrying particles to the
receiver. We show that the particle transport affected by Brownian motion,
fluid flow, and an external magnetic field can be mathematically modeled as
diffusion with drift. Thereby, we reveal that the key parameters determining
the magnetic force are the particle size and the magnetic field gradient.
Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the channel impulse response,
which is used to evaluate the potential gain in the expected number of observed
nanoparticles due to the magnetic field. Furthermore, adopting the symbol error
rate as performance metric, we show that using magnetic nanoparticles can
enable reliable communication in the presence of disruptive fluid flow.
Numerical results obtained by particle-based simulation validate the accuracy

function covering a unit area with decrease of the width of the rectangle to
zero, and in quantum mechanics the eigenvectors of the position operator take
the form of the delta function. When discussing the position measurement in
quantum mechanics, one is prompted by the mathematical convention that uses the
rectangular wave function of sufficiently narrow width to approximate the delta
function in order to making the state of the position physical. We argue that
such an approximation is improper in physics, because during the position
measurement the energy transfer to the particle might be infinitely large. The
continuous and square-integrable functions of both sharp peak and sufficiently
narrow width can then be better approximations of the delta function to
represent the physical states of position. When the slit experiment is taken as
an apparatus of position measurement, no matter what potential is used to model
the slit, only the ground state of the slit-dependent wave function matters.

this objective very challenging. In this work an innovative iterative method

normalization constants is presented. This technique is successfully validated
on a simulated thermal cocktail of resonances. This demonstrates that the
iterative procedure is a powerful tool to reconstruct multi-differentially
inclusive resonant signals in high multiplicity events as produced in heavy ion
collisions.

of geophysical flows by applying stochastic mode reduction to the
one-dimensional stochastically forced shallow water equations. The problem is
formulated in physical space by defining resolved variables as local spatial
averages over finite-volume cells and unresolved variables as corresponding
residuals. Based on the assumption of a time-scale separation between the slow
spatial averages and the fast residuals, the stochastic mode reduction
procedure is used to obtain a low-resolution model for the spatial averages
alone with local stochastic subgrid-scale parameterization coupling each
resolved variable only to a few neighboring cells. The closure improves the
results of the low-resolution model and outperforms two purely empirical
stochastic parameterizations. It is shown that the largest benefit is in the
representation of the energy spectrum. By adjusting only a single coefficient
(the strength of the noise) we observe that there is a potential for improving
the performance of the parameterization, if additional tuning of the
coefficients is performed. In addition, the scale-awareness of the
parameterizations is studied.

major contributions: Firstly, it presents a novel and generic workflow that
initially classifies the spaceborne TomoSAR point clouds $ - $ generated by
processing VHR SAR image stacks using advanced interferometric techniques known
as SAR tomography (TomoSAR) $ - $ into buildings and non-buildings with the aid
of auxiliary information (i.e., either using openly available 2-D building
footprints or adopting an optical image classification scheme) and later back
project the extracted building points onto the SAR imaging coordinates to
produce automatic large-scale benchmark labelled (buildings/non-buildings) SAR
datasets. Secondly, these labelled datasets (i.e., building masks) have been
utilized to construct and train the state-of-the-art deep Fully Convolution
Neural Networks with an additional Conditional Random Field represented as a
Recurrent Neural Network to detect building regions in a single VHR SAR image.
Such a cascaded formation has been successfully employed in computer vision and
remote sensing fields for optical image classification but, to our knowledge,
has not been applied to SAR images. The results of the building detection are
illustrated and validated over a TerraSAR-X VHR spotlight SAR image covering
approximately 39 km$ ^2 $ $ - $ almost the whole city of Berlin $ - $ with mean

  settlements and slums in cities from street intersections using machine
  learning","26 pages",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Identifying current and future informal regions within cities remains a
crucial issue for policymakers and governments in developing countries. The
delineation process of identifying such regions in cities requires a lot of
resources. While there are various studies that identify informal settlements
based on satellite image classification, relying on both supervised or
unsupervised machine learning approaches, these models either require multiple
input data to function or need further development with regards to precision.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method for identifying and predicting
informal settlements using only street intersections data, regardless of the
variation of urban form, number of floors, materials used for construction or
street width. With such minimal input data, we attempt to provide planners and
policy-makers with a pragmatic tool that can aid in identifying informal zones
in cities. The algorithm of the model is based on spatial statistics and a
machine learning approach, using Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL) and
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The proposed model relies on defining
informal settlements based on two ubiquitous characteristics that these regions
tend to be filled in with smaller subdivided lots of housing relative to the
formal areas within the local context, and the paucity of services and
infrastructure within the boundary of these settlements that require relatively
bigger lots. We applied the model in five major cities in Egypt and India that
have spatial structures in which informality is present. These cities are
Greater Cairo, Alexandria, Hurghada and Minya in Egypt, and Mumbai in India.
The predictSLUMS model shows high validity and accuracy for identifying and
predicting informality within the same city the model was trained on or in
different ones of a similar context.

improve computer vision by offering more human-like vision power. These
features are not based on image pixels absolute or relative intensity; neither
based on shape or colour. So, no complex pixel by pixel calculation is
required. For human eyes, pixel by pixel calculation is like seeing an image
with maximum zoom which is done only when a higher level of details is
required. Normally, first we look at an image to get an overall idea about it
to know whether it deserves further investigation or not. This capacity of
getting an idea at a glance is analysed and three basic features are proposed
to empower computer vision. Potential of proposed features is tested and
established through different medical dataset. Achieved accuracy in
classification demonstrates possibilities and potential of the use of the
proposed features in image processing.
