to three of the best studied historical Milky Way core-collapse supernovae.
Consistent with previous work, we find there to be no plausible binary
companion to either the Crab or Cas A supernovae. For the first time, we
present a systematic search for a former companion to the Vela supernova, and
rule out essentially any surviving luminous ($>L_\odot$) companion. Based on
parallax and proper motion, we identify a faint source (Star A; Gaia Source ID
5521955992667891584) which is kinematically consistent with being a former
binary companion to the Vela SN progenitor. However, the inferred absolute
magnitude of this source is extremely faint, raising the possibility that it
may in fact be a background interloper. In addition, we derive a new distance
($3.37^{+4.04}_{-0.97}$ kpc) to the Crab SN based on the Gaia parallax
measurements, which is significantly further than the 2 kpc distance typically
adopted. Finally, we demonstrate that Gaia can be used to measure the secular
decline in the luminosity of the Crab pulsar, and provide a new test of pulsar
models.

optimized using an iterative procedure, where the identification of minute

method. The accuracy of the method and of the 1D + LTE model is determined
using coud\'{e}/HARPS/MUSICOS spectra of the Sun and a sample of 10 Gaia

templates for H$\alpha$ temperature diagnostics without renormalization. The
comparison with the Sun shows that $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ derived with H$\alpha$

28 K. Interferometry and Infrared Flux Method show a dependency on metallicity

recent attention for their theoretical cut improvement and runtime guarantees.
In this work we present two improvements for using flow-based methods in

generalized objective function that allows practitioners to place strict and
soft penalties on excluding specific seed nodes from the output set. This
feature allows us to avoid the tendency, often exhibited by previous flow-based
methods, to contract a large seed set into a small set of nodes that does not
contain all or even most of the seed nodes. Our second contribution is a fast
algorithm for minimizing our generalized objective function, based on a variant
of the push-relabel algorithm for computing preflows. We make our approach very
fast in practice by implementing a global relabeling heuristic and employing a
warm-start procedure to quickly solve related cut problems. In practice our
algorithm is faster than previous related flow-based methods, and is also more
robust in detecting ground truth target regions in a graph, thanks to its
ability to better incorporate semi-supervised information about target
clusters.

made abstract theoretical arguments about the second law of thermodynamics and
quantum theory in curved spacetime respectively. Testing these ideas
experimentally has, so far, been impractical because the putative flux of
Hawking radiation from astrophysical BHs is too small to be distinguished from
the rest of the hot environment. Here, it is proposed that the spectrum of
emitted gravitational waves (GWs) after the merger of two BHs, in particular
the spectrum of GW150914, can be used to infer a lower limit on the magnitude
of the entropy of the post-merger BH. This lower bound is potentially
significant as it could be of the same order as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
To infer this limit, we first assume that the result of the merger is an
ultracompact object with an external geometry which is Schwarzschild or Kerr,
but with an outer surface which is capable of reflecting in-falling GWs rather
than fully absorbing them. If the absence of deviations from the predictions of
general relativity in detected GW signals will be verified, we will then obtain
a bound on the minimal redshift factor of GWs that emerge from the vicinity of
the object's surface. This lack of deviations would also mean that the remnant
of the merger has to have a strongly absorbing surface and must then be a BH
for all practical purposes. We conclude that a relationship between the minimal
redshift factor and the BH entropy, which was first proposed by 't Hooft, could
then be used to set a lower bound on the entropy of the post-merger BH.

imposed modulation, and reflecting the interplay between reaction and diffusion
terms. The information gathered on the observation node is used to predict the
stationary density as displayed by the system, via a direct implementation of
the celebrated Heterogeneous Mean Field (HMF) approximation. This knowledge
translates into a linear problem which can be solved to return the entries of
the sought distribution. A variant of the model is then considered which
consists in assuming a localized source where the reactive constituents are
injected, at a rate that can be adjusted as a stepwise function of time. The
linear problem obtained when operating in this setting allows one to recover a
fair estimate of the underlying system size. Numerical experiments are carried
so as to challenge the predictive ability of the theory.

information about program order, rather than discarding it as traditional
commutative effect systems do. This extra expressive power allows effect
systems to reason about behavior over time, capturing properties such as
atomicity, unstructured lock ownership, or even general safety properties.
While we now understand the essential denotational (categorical) models fairly
well, application of these ideas to real software is hampered by the sheer
variety of source level control flow constructs in real languages. Denotational
approaches are general enough to accommodate any particular control flow
construct, but provide no guidance on the details, let alone applications.
  We address this new problem by appeal to a classic idea: macro-expression of
commonly-used programming constructs in terms of control operators. We give an
effect system for a subset of Racket's tagged delimited control operators, as a
lifting of an effect system for a language without direct control operators.
This gives the first account of sequential effects in the presence of general
control operators. Using this system, we also re-derive the sequential effect
system rules for control flow constructs previously shown sound directly, and
derive sequential effect rules for new constructs not previously studied in the
context of source-level sequential effect systems. This offers a way to
directly extend source-level support for sequential effect systems to real

proteins in silica without use of a pre-formed particle matrix. Stabilisation
is done by tailor fitting individual proteins with a silica coat using a
modified sol-gel process. Biopharmaceuticals, for example, liquid-formulated
vaccines with adjuvants, have poor thermal stability. Heating or freezing
impairs their potency. As a result, there is an increase in the prevalence of
vaccine-preventable diseases in low-income countries even when there are means
to combat them. One of the root causes lies in the problematic vaccine
cold-chain distribution. We believe that ensilication can improve vaccine
availability by enabling transportation without refrigeration. Here, we show
that ensilication stabilises tetanus toxoid C fragment (TTCF) and demonstrate
that this material can be stored and transported at ambient temperature without
compromising the immunogenic properties of TTCF in vivo. TTCF is a component of
the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine. To further our
understanding of the ensilication process, and its protective effect on
proteins we have studied the formation of TTCF-silica nanoparticles via
time-resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Our results reveal
ensilication to be a staged diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) type
reaction, induced by the presence of TTCF protein at neutral pH. Analysis of
scattering data indicates tailor fitting of TTCF protein. The experimental in
vivo immunisation data confirms the retention of immunogenicity after release
from silica. Our results suggest that we could utilise this technology for

assistance of human activities during surgical procedures. Efficient face
detection algorithms can indeed help to detect and identify the persons present
in the room, and also be used to automatically anonymize the data. However,
current algorithms trained on natural images do not generalize well to the
operating room (OR) images. In this work, we provide a comparison of
state-of-the-art face detectors on OR data and also present an approach to
train a face detector for the OR by exploiting non-annotated OR images.
Methods: We propose a comparison of 6 state-of-the-art face detectors on
clinical data using Multi-View Operating Room Faces (MVOR-Faces), a dataset of
operating room images capturing real surgical activities. We then propose to
use self-supervision, a domain adaptation method, for the task of face
detection in the OR. The approach makes use of non-annotated images to
fine-tune a state-of-the-art detector for the OR without using any human
supervision. Results: The results show that the best model, namely the tiny
face detector, yields an average precision of 0.536 at Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.5. Our self-supervised model using non-annotated clinical data
outperforms this result by 9.2%. Conclusion: We present the first comparison of
state-of-the-art face detectors on operating room images and show that results
can be significantly improved by using self-supervision on non-annotated data.

within this model using a leptonic emission scenario. Here we expand that work
by using a hadronic scenario, which gives us greater freedom with respect to
the location of the emission region within the jet. This is important, since
the inferred gas cloud parameters depend on the distance from the black hole.
While the hadronic model faces the problem of invoking super-Eddington jet
luminosities, it reproduces well the long-term trend and also days-long
subflares. While the latter result in inferred cloud parameters that match
those expected for clouds of the broad-line region, the long-term trend is not
compatible with such an interpretation. We explore the possibilities that the
cloud is from the atmosphere of a red giant star or comes from a star-forming
region that passes through the jet. The latter could also explain the much

which to explore how large a role modifications of gravity can play on galactic
scales. In this article, we extend these previous works by asking whether the
same symmetron field can explain the difference between the baryonic and lens
masses of galaxies through a modification of gravity. We consider the
possibilities for minimal modifications of the model and find that this
difference cannot be explained entirely by the symmetron fifth force without
extending the field content of the model. Instead, we are pushed towards a
regime of parameter space where one scalar field both mediates a fifth force
and stores enough energy density that it also contributes to the galaxy's
gravitational potential as a dark matter component, a regime which remains to
be fully explored.

an asymmetry between left and right transmission coefficients (in the zigzag

independently of the underlying background cosmological model. However this
inference is complicated by late-time non-linearities that introduce model and
tracer dependencies in the clustering correlation function and power spectrum,
which must be properly accounted for. With this in mind, we introduce the
""Purely-Geometric-BAO,"" which provides a rigorous tool to measure cosmological
distances without assuming a specific background cosmology. We focus on the
2-point clustering correlation function monopole, and show how to implement
such an inference scheme employing two different methodologies: the Linear
Point standard ruler (LP) and correlation-function model-fitting (CF-MF). For
the first time we demonstrate how, by means of the CF-MF, we can measure very
precisely the sound-horizon/isotropic-volume-distance ratio,
$r_{d}/D_{V}(\bar{z})$, while correctly propagating all the uncertainties.
Using synthetic data, we compare the outcomes of the two methodologies, and
find that the LP provides up to $50\%$ more precise measurements than the
CF-MF. Finally, we test a procedure widely employed in BAO analyses: fitting
the 2-point function while fixing the cosmological and the non-linear-damping
parameters at fiducial values. We find that this underestimates the distance
errors by nearly a factor of $2$. We thus recommend that this practice be
reconsidered, whether for parameter determination or model selection.

indicating the presence of absorbing material obscuring the disk and accreting
primary star at specific orbital phases consistent with L1 stream material
overflowing the disk edge. We simulate the L1 stream interaction with the disk
using tests particles within the context of the Roche model in the restricted
three-body problem. At the disk bow shock the L1 stream particles are deflected
and launched onto ballistic trajectories above the disk (as would normally
occurs at the front of a detached shock in the hypersonic flow past a blunt
body).At a given scale height, the material is assumed to continue without
being affected by the disk, while at lower altitude it is being launched at an
increasing elevation, as well as gradually being dragged by the Keplerian flow.
We follow the stream material ballistic trajectories over the disk surface,
where they reach a maximum height z/r at a binary phase $\Phi \sim 0.75$, and
land onto the disk at a smaller radius around phase $\Phi \sim 0.5$. The radial
velocity for each $L1$ stream ballistic trajectory along the line of sight (of
the observer) to the hot inner parts of the disk is computed as a function of
the orbital phase for a binary configuration matching the dwarf nova U
Geminorum. The computed velocity amplitudes, phases, and pattern match the
observed velocity offsets of the metal lines in the FUSE spectrum of U Gem
during outburst. As ballistic trajectories are much easier to compute than
realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we propose the use of
the L1 stream deflection and ballistic launching as a means for the analysis of
the absorption lines orbital variability in semi-detached binaries and to

accomplishment of fundamental facts, we first explore the effect of particle
size and clustering in the PIM in Gr nanoplates (GNPs)/yttrium iron garnet

fine MNPs distributed uniformly on the GNPs have higher saturation
magnetization due to the PIM in Gr. We propose that such magnetic plates can
thus be used to shield the stray field generated on the surface of magnetic
sensors and play a role as a magnetic lens to prevent the field emanating
outside the body of magnetic specimen. The GNPs/YIG composites are coated on a
magnetic ribbon and proposed for application in magneto-impedance (MI) sensors.
We show that such planar magnetic flakes enhance the MI response against the
external applied magnetic field significantly. The suggested application can be
furthermore developed toward bio-sensing and magnetic shielding in different
magnetic sensors and devices.

which in many environments of interest includes strong interferers. Thus
receivers for the wideband communication systems often need to mitigate
interferers to reduce the distortion caused by the amplifier nonlinearity and
noise. Recently, a new architecture for communication receivers known as random
modulation mixes a signal with different pseudorandom sequences using multiple
branches of channels before sampling. While random modulation is used in these
receivers to acquire the signal at low sampling rates, the modulation sequences
used lack the ability to suppress interferers due to their flat spectra. In
previous work, we introduced the design of a single spectrally shaped binary
sequence that mitigates interferers to replace the pseudorandom sequence in a
channel. However, the designed sequences cannot provide the stable recovery
achieved by pseudorandom sequence approaches. In this paper, we extend our
previous sequence design to guarantee stable recovery by designing a set of
sequences to be orthogonal to each other. We show that it is difficult to find
the necessary number of sequences featuring mutual orthogonality and introduce
oversampling to the sequence set design to improve the recovery performance. We
propose an algorithm for multi-branch sequence design as a binary optimization
problem, which is solved using a semidefinite program relaxation and randomized
projection. While it is common to model narrowband interferers as a subspace
spanned by a subset of elements from the Fourier basis, we show that the
Slepian basis provides an alternative and more suitable compact representation
for signals with components contained in narrow spectrum bands. Numerical
experiments using the proposed sequence sets show their advantages against
pseudorandom sequences and our previous work.

compute surface tension. The advection of the volume fraction is performed

of the density. To find the density on the staggered cells on which the
velocity is centered, an auxiliary reconstruction of the density is performed.

the torus (the syndrome or state). The Q-function is represented by a deep
convolutional neural network. Using the translational invariance on the torus
allows for viewing each defect from a central perspective which significantly
simplifies the state space representation independently of the number of defect
pairs. The training is done using experience replay, where data from the
algorithm being played out is stored and used for mini-batch upgrade of the
Q-network. We find performance which is close to, and for small error rates
asymptotically equivalent to, that achieved by the Minimum Weight Perfect
Matching algorithm for code distances up to $d=7$. Our results show that it is
possible for a self-trained agent without supervision or support algorithms to
find a decoding scheme that performs on par with hand-made algorithms, opening
up for future machine engineered decoders for more general error models and
error correcting codes.

are pertinent for the recognition of not-necessarily regular languages. Via
recognition, the study of existential quantification in logic on words amounts
to the study of certain spans of Boolean spaces with internal semigroups. In
turn, these can be understood as the superposition of a span of Boolean spaces
and a span of semigroups. In this note, we first study these separately. More
precisely, we identify the conditions under which each of these spans gives
rise to a morphism into the respective power or Vietoris construction of the
corresponding structure. Combining these characterizations, we obtain such a
characterization for spans of Boolean spaces with internal semigroups which we
use to describe the topo-algebraic counterpart of monadic second-order
existential quantification. This is closely related to a part of the earlier
work on existential quantification in first-order logic on words by Gehrke,
Petri\c san and Reggio. The observation that certain morphisms lift
contravariantly to the appropriate power structures makes our analysis very
simple.

enrich the maximum variance MCCA framework. In this context, the present
paper's novel graph-regularized (G) MCCA approach minimizes the distance
between the wanted canonical variables and the common low-dimensional

the rare decay $\pi^0\to e^+e^-$ and the Dalitz decay of $\pi^0$, and provide a

which is by two orders of magnitude more precise than the current PDG average.
This value is obtained using the complete set of the next-to-leading-order
radiative corrections in the QED sector, and incorporates up-to-date values of
the $\pi^0$-transition-form-factor slope. The ratio $R$ translates into the
branching ratios of the two main $\pi^0$ decay modes:
$\mathcal{B}(\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma)=98.8131(6)\,\%$ and $\mathcal{B}(\pi^0\to
e^+e^-\gamma(\gamma))=1.1836(6)\,\%$. Furthermore, we present the complete set
of radiative corrections to the Dalitz decays
$\eta^{(\prime)}\to\ell^+\ell^-\gamma$ beyond the soft-photon approximation,
i.e. over the whole range of the Dalitz plot and with no restrictions on the
energy of a radiative photon. The corrections inevitably depend on the
$\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma^*\gamma^{(*)}$ transition form factors. For the
singly-virtual transition form factor appearing e.g. in the bremsstrahlung
correction, recent dispersive calculations are used. For the
one-photon-irreducible contribution at the one-loop level (for the

real-valued models for a range of real-valued classification tasks. The use of
complex numbers allows neural networks to handle noise on the complex plane.
When classifying real-valued data with a complex-valued neural network, the
imaginary parts of the weights follow their real parts. This behaviour is
indicative for a task that does not require a complex-valued model. We further
investigated this in a synthetic classification task. We can transfer many

they leave behind naval ships. In order to numerically model and predict these
bubbles in naval applications, subgrid-scale models are required because of the
extreme separation of length- and time-scales between the macroscopic
geometries and the physical processes leading to the formation of these
bubbles. Yet, there is much that is unknown about the mechanism behind the
entrainment of such bubbles. Furthermore, quantitative information regarding
their size distribution and dependence on flow parameters is very limited.
Impact events are hypothesized to be the main contributor to the generation of
micro-bubbles. This is due to a phenomenon known as Mesler entrainment, which
has been observed in the context of the drop-pool impact problem. Namely, when
a water droplet with diameter of $\mathcal{O}(1mm)$ impacts a deep water pool
with an impact velocity of $\mathcal{O}(1m/s)$, hundreds of air micro-bubbles
are entrained into the pool. These bubbles have been found to be remnants of a
very thin air film entrapped between the two liquid bodies. These films have
extremely high aspect ratios and after being punctured, shed micro-bubbles
while retracting on time scales much shorter than the outer flow time scales.
This separation of time-scales, along with a lacking of studies on retracting
thin gas films has motivated us to study this fundamental problem with
numerical simulations in two and three dimensions. Using a diffuse interface
method, we perform two-phase simulations of retracting thin gas films in
initially static liquid backgrounds to gain understanding regarding this
problem and gather statistics that can be potentially used in a subgrid-scale
model to predict micro-bubble shedding from a thin gas film. Coupling a model

problems that have seen recent interest. Our first result shows that, in the
weak feedback regime, there is global uniqueness for a very general class of
random drivers. By weak feedback we mean the case where the contagion
parameters are small enough to prevent blow-ups in solutions. Next, we
specialise to a Brownian driver and show how the same techniques can be
extended to give short-time uniqueness after blow-ups, regardless of the
feedback strength. The heart of our approach is a surprisingly simple
probabilistic comparison argument that is robust in the sense that it does not
ask for any regularity of the solutions.

is that real-world data is generated by a few explanatory factors of variation
which can be recovered by unsupervised learning algorithms. In this paper, we
provide a sober look at recent progress in the field and challenge some common
assumptions. We first theoretically show that the unsupervised learning of
disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive
biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than 12000 models
covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible
large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that
while the different methods successfully enforce properties ``encouraged'' by
the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be
identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not
seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks.
Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be
explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision,
investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned
representations, and consider a reproducible experimental setup covering
several data sets.

intractability in unsupervised learning and high-dimensional data analysis.
While polynomial time smoothed analysis guarantees have been obtained for
worst-case intractable problems like tensor decompositions and learning
mixtures of Gaussians, such guarantees have been hard to obtain for several
other important problems in unsupervised learning. A core technical challenge
in analyzing algorithms is obtaining lower bounds on the least singular value
for random matrix ensembles with dependent entries, that are given by
low-degree polynomials of a few base underlying random variables.
  In this work, we address this challenge by obtaining high-confidence lower
bounds on the least singular value of new classes of structured random matrix
ensembles of the above kind. We then use these bounds to design algorithms with
polynomial time smoothed analysis guarantees for the following three important
problems in unsupervised learning:
  1. Robust subspace recovery, when the fraction $\alpha$ of inliers in the
d-dimensional subspace $T \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is at least $\alpha >
(d/n)^\ell$ for any constant integer $\ell>0$. This contrasts with the known
worst-case intractability when $\alpha< d/n$, and the previous smoothed
analysis result which needed $\alpha > d/n$ (Hardt and Moitra, 2013).
  2. Learning overcomplete hidden markov models, where the size of the state
space is any polynomial in the dimension of the observations. This gives the
first polynomial time guarantees for learning overcomplete HMMs in a smoothed
analysis model.
  3. Higher order tensor decompositions, where we generalize the so-called
FOOBI algorithm of Cardoso to find order-$\ell$ rank-one tensors in a subspace.
This allows us to obtain polynomially robust decomposition algorithms for
$2\ell$'th order tensors with rank $O(n^{\ell})$.

addresses the restriction of the abstract execution of parametric regulatory

the goal-oriented reduction of dynamics is lifted to parametric networks, and
is proven to preserve all the minimal traces to the specified goal states. It

interactions between spins and charges give rise to collective modes and
topological states. Even simple, non-interacting theories display a rich
landscape of energy states --- distinct many-particle configurations connected
by spin- and energy-dependent transition rates. The collective energy landscape
is difficult to characterize or predict, especially in regimes of frustration
where many-body effects create a multiply degenerate landscape. Here we use
network science to characterize the complex interconnection patterns of these
energy-state transitions. Using an experimentally verified computational model
of electronic transport through quantum antidots, we construct networks where
nodes represent accessible energy states and edges represent allowed
transitions. We then explore how physical changes in currents and voltages are
reflected in the network topology. We find that the networks exhibit Rentian
scaling, which is characteristic of efficient transportation systems in
computer circuitry, neural circuitry, and human mobility, and can be used to
measure the interconnection complexity of a network. Remarkably, networks
corresponding to points of frustration in quantum transport (due, for example,
to spin-blockade effects) exhibit an enhanced topological complexity relative
to networks not experiencing frustration. Our results demonstrate that network
characterizations of the abstract topological structure of energy landscapes
can capture salient properties of quantum transport. More broadly, our approach
motivates future efforts to use network science in understanding the dynamics

the Novikov-Furutsu theorem and a novel approximation, employing a stochastic
Volterra-Taylor functional expansion around instantaneous response moments,
leading to efficient, closed, approximate equations for the response pdf. These
equations retain a tractable amount of nonlocality and nonlinearity, and they
are valid in both the transient and long-time regimes for any correlation

existing relevant models, and generalize Hanggi's ansatz in a rational way.
Numerical results for a bistable nonlinear RDE confirm the accuracy and the

simultaneously generating the fermion and sfermion mass hierarchies. After
supersymmetry is broken by the strong dynamics, partial compositeness causes
the first- and second-generation sfermions to be split from the much lighter

analyzing the classical vacuum energy as a function of parameters such as the
Higgs mass, we show how near-criticality, i.e. fine-tuning, corresponds
universally to boundaries where the vacuum energy transitions from exactly flat
to concave down. In the presence of quantum corrections, these boundary regions
can easily be perturbed to become maxima of the vacuum energy. After
introducing a dynamical scalar field $\phi$ which scans the Higgs sector
parameters, we propose several possible mechanisms by which this field could be
localized to the maximum. One possibility is that the $\phi$ potential has many
vacua, with those near the maximum vacuum energy expanding faster during a long
period of cosmic inflation and hence dominating the volume of the Universe.
Alternately, we describe scenarios in which vacua near the maximum could be
anthropically favored, due to selection of the late-time cosmological constant
or dark matter density. Independent of these specific approaches, the physical
value of the weak scale in our proposal is generated naturally and dynamically
from loops of heavy states coupled to the Higgs. These states are predicted to
be a loop factor heavier than in models without this mechanism, avoiding

An important advantage of Komondor over other well-known wireless simulators

simplification of the core operation. This allows outperforming the execution
time of other simulators like ns-3, thus supporting large-scale scenarios with
a huge number of nodes. In this paper, we provide insights into the Komondor

operation of Komondor is validated in a variety of scenarios against different
tools: the ns-3 simulator and two analytical tools based on Continuous Time
Markov Networks (CTMNs) and the Bianchi's DCF model. Results show that Komondor
captures the IEEE 802.11 operation very similarly to ns-3. Finally, we discuss
the potential of Komondor for simulating complex environments -- even with

Filaments are one of the structural components of this web, which can be
introduced as a novel probe to study the formation and evolution of structures

baryon problem. The aim of this work is to introduce an analytical framework to
study the statistics of filaments such as number density of them and also to
obtain the length-mass relation. For this objective, we model filaments as
collapsed objects which have an extension in one direction, accordingly we use
the ellipsoidal collapse to study the evolution of an over-dense region via
gravitational instability. %In this context, we consider the critical density
of filament formation, which will be a crucial parameter for number density
count. We find that the nonlinear density of filaments in the epoch of
formation is almost mass independent and is in order of $\sim 30$. By
introducing {\it{filament's extended condition}} we find a fitting function for
length-mass relation. For the statistics of filaments, we propose a novel
framework named excursion set of saddle points. In this approach, we count the
saddle points of the density field Hessian matrix, and relate it to the count
of filaments. In addition, we addressed the filament in filament problem with
up-crossing approximation.

the circumgalatic medium (CGM), the reservoir of tenuous gas surrounding a
galaxy and extending to its virial radius. We introduce the technique of
Enhanced Halo Resolution (EHR), enabling more realistic physical modeling of
the simulated CGM by consistently forcing gas refinement to smaller scales
throughout the virial halo of a simulated galaxy. We investigate the effects of
EHR in the Tempest simulations, a suite of Enzo-based cosmological zoom
simulations following the evolution of an L* galaxy, resolving spatial scales
of 500 comoving pc out to 100 comoving kpc in galactocentric radius. Among its
many effects, EHR (1) changes the thermal balance of the CGM, increasing its
cool gas content and decreasing its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool
gas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables these cool clouds to exist
at progressively smaller size scales. Observationally, this results in a boost
in ""low ions"" like H I and a drop in ""high ions"" like O VI throughout the CGM.
These effects of EHR do not converge in the Tempest simulations, but
extrapolating these trends suggests that the CGM in reality is a mist
consisting of ubiquitous, small, long-lived, cool clouds suspended in a hot
medium at the virial temperature of the halo. Additionally, we explore the
physical mechanisms to explain why EHR produces the above effects, proposing
that it works both by (1) better sampling the distribution of CGM phases
enabling runaway cooling in the denser, cooler tail of the phase distribution;
and (2) preventing cool gas clouds from artificially mixing with the ambient
hot halo and evaporating. Evidence is found for both EHR mechanisms occurring
in the Tempest simulations.

\times 10^{12} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) along with twelve re-runs with embedded
galaxy potentials grown to match the observed Milky Way disk and bulge today.
The central galaxy potential destroys subhalos on orbits with small pericenters
in every halo, regardless of the ratio of galaxy mass to halo mass. This has
several important implications. 1) Most of the $\mathtt{Disk}$ runs have no
subhaloes larger than $V_{\rm max} = 4.5$ km s$^{-1}$ within $20$ kpc and a
significant lack of substructure going back $\sim 8$ Gyr, suggesting that local
stream-heating signals from dark substructure will be rare. 2) The pericenter
distributions of Milky Way satellites derived from $\mathit{Gaia}$ data are
remarkably similar to the pericenter distributions of subhaloes in the
$\mathtt{Disk}$ runs, while the DMO runs drastically over-predict galaxies with
pericenters smaller than 20 kpc. 3) The enhanced destruction produces a tension
opposite to that of the classic `missing satellites' problem: in order to
account for ultra-faint galaxies known within $30$ kpc of the Galaxy, we must
populate haloes with $V_\mathrm{peak} \simeq 7$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 3 \times
10^{7} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at infall), well below the atomic cooling limit of
$V_\mathrm{peak} \simeq 16$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 5 \times 10^{8}

dwarfs, this implies the existence of $\sim 1000$ satellite galaxies within 300
kpc of the Milky Way.

semimetal. This model can describe the low-energy physics of HgTe, gray-Sn, 227
pyrochlore iridates and half-Heuslers. For the sake of concreteness we only
consider the short-range components of the Coulomb interaction. By combining
mean-field analysis with a renormalization group (RG) calculation, we construct
multiple cuts of the global phase diagram of interacting spin-3/2 fermions at
zero and finite temperature and chemical doping. Such phase diagrams display a
rich confluence of competing orders, among which rotational symmetry breaking
nematic insulators and time reversal symmetry breaking magnetic orders are the
prominent excitonic phases. We also show that even repulsive interactions can
be conducive for both s-wave and d-wave pairings. The reconstructed band
structure inside the ordered phases allows us to organize them according to the
energy (entropy) gain in the following (reverse) order: s-wave pairing, nematic
phases, magnetic orders and d-wave pairings, at zero chemical doping. But, the
paired states are always energetically superior over the excitonic ones for
finite doping. The phase diagrams obtained from the RG analysis show that an
ordered phase with higher energy (entropy) gain is realized at low (high)
temperature. In addition, we establish a ""selection rule"" between the
interaction channels and the resulting ordered phases, suggesting that
repulsive interactions in the magnetic (nematic) channels are conducive for the
nucleation of d-wave (s-wave) pairing. The proposed methodology can shed light
on the global phase diagram of other strongly interacting multi-band systems,
such as doped Dirac semimetal, topological insulators and the like.

molecular gas depletion time of about $\sim$ 2 Gyr (based on H$\alpha$),
comparable to those of normal spiral galaxies. Both from a comparison of the
H$\alpha$ emission, tracing the current SFR, and far-ultraviolet (FUV)
emission, tracing the recent SFR during the past tens of Myr, as well as from
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with CIGALE, we find that the SFR
has increased by a factor of about 2-3 during the recent past. This increase is
particularly noticeable in the centre of the galaxy. A pixel-to-pixel
comparison of the SFR, molecular gas mass and stellar mass shows that the
central region has had a depressed FUV-traced SFR, both compared to the
molecular gas and the stellar mass, whereas the H$\alpha$-traced SFR shows a
normal level. The atomic and molecular gas distribution is asymmetric, but the
position-velocity diagram along the major axis shows a pattern of regular
rotation. We conclude that the minor merger has most likely caused variations
in the SFR in the past resulting in a moderate increase of the SFR, but it has
not perturbed the gas significantly so that the molecular depletion time
remains normal.

matrix renormalization group are a powerful tool for the simulation of
open-system quantum dynamics. For finite-temperature environments, however,
this approach suffers from an unfavorable algorithmic scaling with increasing
temperature. We prove that the system dynamics under thermal environments can
be non-perturbatively described by temperature-dependent system-environmental
couplings with the initial environment state being in its pure vacuum state,
instead of a mixed thermal state. As a consequence, as long as the initial
system state is pure, the global system-environment state remains pure at all
times. The resulting speedup and relaxed memory requirements of this approach
enable the efficient simulation of open quantum systems interacting with highly
structured environments in any temperature range, with applications extending
from quantum thermodynamics to quantum effects in mesoscopic systems.

These components are given dynamics and become physical in our setup. They
enter the massless theory in the form of an antisymmetric tensor field which
makes the action reminiscent of the bosonic sector of supergravity. We then
demonstrate that both the metric and the antisymmetric tensor can be made
massive by adding a potential term for the vierbein. The form of this mass
potential is inspired by ghost-free massive gravity. We confirm the absence of
additional and potentially pathological degrees of freedom in an ADM analysis.
However, at the linearized level around maximally symmetric solutions, the

roots, however, quantum theory is infamous for being highly counterintuitive,
largely due to its intrinsically probabilistic nature. Neural networks have
recently emerged as a powerful tool that can extract non-trivial correlations

language translation, medical diagnosis and image recognition. It remains to be
seen if neural networks can be trained to predict stochastic quantum evolution
without a priori specifying the rules of quantum theory. Here, we demonstrate
that a recurrent neural network can be trained in real time to infer the
individual quantum trajectories associated with the evolution of a
superconducting qubit under unitary evolution, decoherence and continuous
measurement from raw observations only. The network extracts the system
Hamiltonian, measurement operators and physical parameters. It is also able to
perform tomography of an unknown initial state without any prior calibration.
This method has potential to greatly simplify and enhance tasks in quantum
systems such as noise characterization, parameter estimation, feedback and
optimization of quantum control.

term this effect ""magneto-immutability"" by analogy with incompressibility

anisotropy becomes comparable to the magnetic pressure, suggesting that in
collisionless, weakly magnetized (high-$\beta$) plasmas its dynamical relevance
is similar to that of incompressibility. Simulations of magnetized turbulence
using the weakly collisional Braginskii model show that magneto-immutable
turbulence is surprisingly similar, in most statistical measures, to critically
balanced MHD turbulence. However, in order to minimize magnetic-field
variation, the flow direction becomes more constrained than in MHD, and the
turbulence is more strongly dominated by magnetic energy (a nonzero ""residual

observed-frame $g-r$ vs $r-i$ colours within the locus predicted for $z \sim 4$
massive galaxies. We further removed contamination by stars and artefacts,
obtaining 606 galaxies lining up by the model selection box. We obtained their
photometric redshifts and physical properties by fitting model templates
spanning a wide range of star formation histories, reddening and redshift. Key
to constrain the models is the addition, to the optical DES bands $g$, $r$,
$i$, $z$, and $Y$, of near-IR $J$, $H$, $K_{s}$ data from the Vista Hemisphere
Survey. We further applied several quality cuts to the fitting results,
including goodness of fit and a unimodal redshift probability distribution. We
finally select 233 candidates whose photometric redshift probability
distribution function peaks around $z\sim4$, have high stellar masses
($\log($M$^{*}$/M$_{\odot})\sim 11.7$ for a Salpeter IMF) and ages around 0.1
Gyr, i.e. formation redshift around 5. These properties match those of the
progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the local universe. This is an
ideal sample for spectroscopic follow-up to select the fraction of galaxies
which is truly at high redshift. These initial results and those at the survey

this approach, the main challenges include the design of a suitable variational

these challenges. First, we define the variational class of Computational Graph

variational ansatz. Secondly, we develop a novel optimization scheme,
supervised wave-function optimization (SWO), which systematically improves the
optimized wave-function by drawing on ideas from supervised learning. While SWO
can be used independently of CGS, utilizing them together provides a flexible
framework for the rapid design, prototyping and optimization of variational
wave-functions. We demonstrate CGS and SWO by optimizing for the ground state
wave-function of 1D and 2D Heisenberg models on nine different variational
architectures including architectures not previously used to represent quantum
many-body wave-functions and find they are energetically competitive to other
approaches. One interesting application of this architectural exploration is
that we show that fully convolution neural network wave-functions can be
optimized for one system size and, using identical parameters, produce accurate
energies for a range of system sizes. We expect these methods to increase the

horizontal flows at a given radius with velocities of order 1 km/s; the
direction of the mean flow will vary as a function of height through the
convection zone. We confirm these analytic estimates using Cartesian Boussinesq
convection simulations. These mean horizontal flows lead to a random angular
momentum in supergiant convection zones that exceeds that of the last stable
circular orbit of a black hole by a factor of order 10. As a result, failed
explosions of supergiants - in which the accretion shock onto the neutron star
does not revive, leading to black hole formation - may often produce accretion
discs that can power day-week (blue supergiants) or week-year (yellow and red
supergiants) non-thermal and thermal transients through winds and jets. These
transients will be especially time variable because the angular momentum of the

in turn leads to an upper bound on $T_c$ in two dimensions (2D), which holds
irrespective of pairing mechanism, interaction strength, or order-parameter

of low-density and narrow-band systems, where mean field theory fails. For a
simple parabolic band in 2D with Fermi energy $E_F$, we find that $k_BT_c \leq

open a window for Higgs to Higgs decays. We perform an extensive scan into the
parameter space of 2HDMS of type I and explore the effect of the
singlet-doublet admixture. We found that a large singlet-doublet admixture is
still compatible with the recent Higgs data from LHC. Moreover, we show that
$h_1$ could be quasi-fermiophobic and would decay dominantly into two photons.
We also study in details the consistency of the non-detected decay of $h_2\to
h_1 h_1$ with LHC data followed by $h_1\to \gamma \gamma$ which leads to four
photons final state at LHC: $pp\to h_2\to h_1 h_1\to 4\gamma$. Using the
results of null searches of multi-photons carried by the ATLAS collaboration,
we have found that a large area of the parameter space is still allowed. We

presence of a large galaxy in the halo can destroy subhalos and substantially
alter the mass function and velocity distribution of subhalos. We compare the
effect of galaxy formation on subhalo populations in two state-of-the-art sets
of hydrodynamical CDM simulations of Milky Way mass halos, APOSTLE and AURIGA.
We introduce a new method for tracking the orbits of subhalos between
simulation snapshots that gives accurate results down to a few kiloparsecs from
the centre of the halo. Relative to a dark matter-only simulation, the
abundance of subhalos in APOSTLE is reduced by 50% near the centre and by 10%
within r200. In AURIGA the corresponding numbers are 80% and 40%. The velocity
distributions of subhalos are also affected by the presence of the galaxy, much
more so in AURIGA than in APOSTLE . The differences on subhalo properties in
the two simulations can be traced back to the mass of the central galaxies,
which in AURIGA are typically twice as massive as those in APOSTLE . We show
that some of the results from previous studies are inaccurate due to systematic
errors in the modelling of subhalo orbits near the centre of halos.

for all the cases studied. The habit plane of intragranular hydrides and some

The morphology of intergranular hydrides can vary depending upon the angle
between the grain boundary and the hydride habit plane. The misfit strain
between {\alpha}-Zr and {\delta}-hydride is accommodated by high density of
dislocations and twin structures in the hydrides, and a mechanism of twin
formation in the hydrides has been proposed. The growth of hydrides across
grain boundaries is achieved through an auto-catalytic manner similar to the
growth pattern of intragranular hydrides. Easy collective shear along <1-100>
makes it possible for hydride nucleation at any grain boundaries, while the
process seems to favour grain boundaries with low (<40{\deg}) and high

wide variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics. A
particularly popular form of microfluidics -- called inertial microfluidic flow
sculpting -- involves placing a sequence of pillars to controllably deform an
initial flow field into a desired one. Inertial flow sculpting can be formally
defined as an inverse problem, where one identifies a sequence of pillars
(chosen, with replacement, from a finite set of pillars, each of which produce
a specific transformation) whose composite transformation results in a
user-defined desired transformation. Endemic to most such problems in
engineering, inverse problems are usually quite computationally intractable,
with most traditional approaches based on search and optimization strategies.
In this paper, we pose this inverse problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
problem. We train a DoubleDQN agent to learn from this environment. The results
suggest that learning is possible using a DoubleDQN model with the success
frequency reaching 90% in 200,000 episodes and the rewards converging. While
most of the results are obtained by fixing a particular target flow shape to
simplify the learning problem, we later demonstrate how to transfer the
learning of an agent based on one target shape to another, i.e. from one design
to another and thus be useful for a generic design of a flow shape.

decode from random errors and erasures. We obtain these results by proving
improved bounds on the weight distribution of Reed-Muller codes of high
degrees. Specifically, given weight $\beta \in (0,1)$ we prove an upper bound
on the number of codewords of relative weight at most $\beta$. We obtain new
results in two different settings: for weights $\beta < 1/2$ and for weights
that are close to $1/2$.
  Our new bounds on the weight distribution imply that RM codes with $m$
variables and degree $\gamma m$, for some explicit constant $\gamma$, achieve
capacity for random erasures (i.e. for the binary erasure channel) and for
random errors (for the binary symmetric channel). Earlier, it was known that RM
codes achieve capacity for the binary symmetric channel for degrees $r = o(m)$.
For the binary erasure channel it was known that RM codes achieve capacity for
degree $o(m)$ or $r \in [m/2 \pm O(\sqrt{m})]$. Thus, our result provide a new
range of parameters for which RM achieve capacity for these two well studied
channels. In addition, our results imply that for every $\epsilon > 0$ (in fact
we can get up to $\epsilon = \Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log m}{m}}\right)$) RM
codes of degree $r<(1/2-\epsilon)m$ can correct a fraction of $1-o(1)$ random
erasures with high probability. We also show that, information theoretically,
such codes can handle a fraction of $1/2-o(1)$ random errors with high
probability. Thus, for example, given noisy evaluations of a degree $0.499m$
polynomial, it is possible to interpolate it even if a random $0.499$ fraction
of the evaluations were corrupted, with high probability. While the $o(1)$
terms are not the correct ones to ensure capacity, these results show that RM
codes of such degrees are in some sense close to achieving capacity.

strong Na I resonance line P-Cygni profiles in the rapidly-accreting pre-main
sequence FU Ori objects. We conducted Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations for a standard magnetocentrifugally driven wind (MHD) model and our
own ""Genwind"" models, which allows for a more flexible wind parameterisation.
We find that the fiducial MHD wind and similar Genwind models, which have flows
emerging outward from the inner disc edge, and thus have polar cavities with no
absorbing gas, cannot reproduce the deep, wide Na I absorption lines in FU Ori
objects viewed at low inclination. We find that it is necessary to include an
""inner wind"" to fill this polar cavity to reproduce observations. In addition,
our models assuming pure scattering source functions in the Sobolev
approximation at intermediate viewing angles ($30^{\circ} \lesssim i \lesssim
60^{\circ}$) do not yield sufficiently deep line profiles. Assuming complete
absorption yields better agreement with observations, but simple estimates
strongly suggest that pure scattering should be a much better approximation.
The discrepancy may indicate that the Sobolev approximation is not applicable,
possibly due to turbulence or non-monotonic velocity fields; there is some
observational evidence for the latter. Our results provide guidance for future
attempts to constrain FU Ori wind properties using full MHD wind simulations,
by pointing to the importance of the boundary conditions necessary to give rise
to an inner wind, and by suggesting that the winds must be turbulent to produce
sufficiently deep line profiles.

different code distances, probability datasets and under the depolarizing and

buyer whose values for the items are arbitrarily correlated. It was previously
shown that, in such settings, distributions exist for which the seller's
optimal revenue is infinite, but the best ""simple"" mechanism achieves revenue
at most one ([Briest et. al 15], [Hart and Nisan 13]), even when $m=2$. This
result has long served as a cautionary tale discouraging the study of
multi-item auctions without some notion of ""independent items"".
  In this work we initiate a smoothed analysis of such multi-item auction
settings. We consider a buyer whose item values are drawn from an arbitrarily
correlated multi-dimensional distribution then randomly perturbed with
magnitude $\delta$ under several natural perturbation models. On one hand, we
prove that the ([Briest et. al 15], [Hart and Nisan 13]) construction is
surprisingly robust to certain natural perturbations of this form, and the
infinite gap remains.
  On the other hand, we provide a smoothed model such that the approximation
guarantee of simple mechanisms is smoothed-finite. We show that when the
perturbation has magnitude $\delta$, pricing only the grand bundle guarantees
an $O(1/\delta)$-approximation to the optimal revenue. That is, no matter the
(worst-case) initially correlated distribution, these tiny perturbations
suffice to bring the gap down from infinite to finite. We further show that the
same guarantees hold when $n$ buyers have values drawn from an arbitrarily
correlated $mn$-dimensional distribution (without any dependence on $n$).
  Taken together, these analyses further pin down key properties of correlated
distributions that result in large gaps between simplicity and optimality.

scales, including H+He photo-ionization; photo-electric, Lyman Werner, Compton,
and dust heating; and single+multiple scattering radiation pressure (RP). We
compare distinct numerical algorithms: ray-based LEBRON (exact when
optically-thin) and moments-based M1 (exact when optically-thick). The most
important RFB channels on galaxy scales are photo-ionization heating and
single-scattering RP: in all galaxies, most ionizing/far-UV luminosity (~1/2 of
lifetime-integrated bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the most important
effect is photo-ionization heating from the UV background suppressing
accretion. In MW-mass galaxies, meta-galactic backgrounds have negligible
effects; but local photo-ionization and single-scattering RP contribute to
regulating the galactic star formation efficiency and lowering central
densities. Without some RFB (or other 'rapid' FB), resolved GMCs convert
too-efficiently into stars, making galaxies dominated by hyper-dense, bound
star clusters. This makes star formation more violent and 'bursty' when SNe
explode in these hyper-clustered objects: thus, including RFB 'smoothes' SFHs.
These conclusions are robust to RHD methods, but M1 produces somewhat stronger
effects. Like in previous FIRE simulations, IR multiple-scattering is rare
(negligible in dwarfs, ~10% of RP in massive galaxies): absorption occurs
primarily in 'normal' GMCs with A_v~1.

overcome the effects of other agents' updates. To increase attack stealth, we
propose an alternating minimization strategy, which alternately optimizes for

jet associated with IRAS 16547-4247 at very low frequencies (325 MHz and 610
MHz). The obtained maps reveal an elongated morphology in the SE-NW direction.
In addition, the 610 MHz map shows three knots associated to the elongated
morphology that seems to correspond to the triple radio source identified as
the jet seen at higher frequencies. However, at 325 MHz, although an elongated
morphology is also observed, only two knots appear in the map. By comparing our
knot positions at both frequencies with a precessing jet model used in a
previous work, we find that the knots fall closely to the wiggling path and,
hence, they likely represent shocks of the material of the precessing jet with
the medium. Only the nature of the southernmost knot detected at 325 MHz
remains unclear. Besides, we found that the whole emission of the lobes is
non-thermal down to very low frequencies and that the possible associated
emission mechanisms work differently in in both lobes, causing the
discrepancies between observed frequencies. To explain these discrepancies we
investigate mechanisms such as synchrotron radiative losses in a magnetic field
of about 0.5 mG in the shocks and find this possibility unlikely to occur.
Alternatively, we invoke interaction with an inhomogeneous medium as the most
probable scenario.

contrast to most non-relativistic operators, these pion-exchange currents can
be coherently enhanced by the total number of nucleons, and therefore may
dominate in scenarios where spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interactions are
suppressed. Moreover, for natural values of the couplings, they dominate over
the spin-dependent channel due to their coherence in the nucleus. Using the

deposition of particles can lead to the formation of clogs, typically at
constrictions. Once a clog is formed in a microchannel, advected particles form
an aggregate upstream from the site of the blockage. This aggregate grows over
time, which leads to a dramatic reduction of the flow rate. In this paper, we
present a model that predicts the growth of the aggregate formed upon clogging
of a microchannel. We develop an analytical description that captures the time
evolution of the volume of the aggregate, as confirmed by experiments performed
using a pressure-driven suspension flow in a microfluidic device. We show that
the growth of the aggregate increases the hydraulic resistance in the channel
and leads to a drop in the flow rate of the suspensions. We then derive a model
for the growth of aggregates in multiple parallel microchannels where the
clogging events are described using a stochastic approach. The aggregate
growths in the different channels are coupled. Our work illustrates the
critical influence of clogging events on the evolution of the flow rate in
microchannels. The coupled dynamics of the aggregates described here for
parallel channels is key to bridge clogging at the pore scale with macroscopic
observations of the flow rate evolution at the filter scale.

formalism. By using the Wentzel-Kramers- Brillouin (WKB) method up to 6th
order, we calculate the QNM frequencies of the EiBI charged black holes, the
Einstein-Born-Infeld black holes, and the Born-Infeld charged black holes
within the Palatini $R+\alpha R^2$ gravity. The QNM spectra of these black
holes would deviate from those of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole. In

perturbations of the EiBI charged black holes, the link between the eikonal
QNMs and the unstable null circular orbit around the black hole is violated.

techniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage
unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware
multi-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,
such as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is
achieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate
different views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical
3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In
addition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate
the reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one
view requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our
self-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each
unlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach
can take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness
of our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical
image segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,
a fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art
performances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical

challenge for predictions, as they often emerge at the end of a multi-scale
cascade of atmospheric processes. Climatological studies have shown that the
'tropical transition' (TT) pathway plays a prominent role in cyclogenesis, in
particular over the North Atlantic Ocean. Here we use operational European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble predictions to investigate
the TT of North Atlantic Hurricane Chris (2012), whose formation was preceded
by the merger of two potential vorticity (PV) maxima, eventually resulting in
the storm-inducing PV streamer. The principal goal is to elucidate the dynamic
and thermodynamic processes governing the predictability of cyclogenesis and
subsequent TT. Dynamic time warping is applied to identify ensemble tracks that
are similar to the analysis track. This technique permits small temporal and
spatial shifts in the development.
  The formation of the pre-Chris cyclone is predicted by those members that
also predict the merging of the two PV maxima. The position of the storm
relative to the PV streamer determines whether the pre-Chris cyclone follows
the TT pathway. The transitioning storms are located inside a favorable region
of high equivalent potential temperatures that result from a warm seclusion
underneath the cyclonic roll-up of the PV streamer. A systematic investigation
of consecutive ensemble forecasts indicates that forecast improvements are
linked to specific events, such as the PV merging. The present case exemplifies
how a novel combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian ensemble forecast analysis

visualization systems tailored for the development of these applications.
Frequently, such systems utilize levels of abstraction to improve the
application development process, for instance by providing a data flow network
editor. Unfortunately, these abstractions result in several issues, which need
to be circumvented through an abstraction-centered system design. Often, a high
level of abstraction hides low level details, which makes it difficult to
directly access the underlying computing platform, which would be important to
achieve an optimal performance. Therefore, we propose a layer structure
developed for modern and sustainable visualization systems allowing developers
to interact with all contained abstraction levels. We refer to this interaction
capabilities as usage abstraction levels, since we target application
developers with various levels of experience. We formulate the requirements for
such a system, derive the desired architecture, and present how the concepts
have been exemplary realized within the Inviwo visualization system.
Furthermore, we address several specific challenges that arise during the
realization of such a layered architecture, such as communication between
different computing platforms, performance centered encapsulation, as well as
layer-independent development by supporting cross layer documentation and
debugging capabilities.

rectangular film in the Meissner state was established long ago by the London

shown to be highly non-uniform, diverging at the edges. Accordingly, the
standard view for type II superconductors is that vortices enter at the edges
and, with increasing current, are driven inwards until they self-annihilate at
the centre, causing dissipation. This condition is presumed to define the
critical current. However we have shown that, under self-field (no external

surface current density equals the critical field divided by {\lambda}, across
the entire width. The critical current distribution must therefore be uniform.
Here we report studies of the current and field distribution across commercial
YBa2Cu3O7 conductors and confirm the accepted non-uniform distribution at low
current but demonstrate a radical crossover to a uniform distribution at
critical current. This crossover ends discontinuously at a singularity and
calculations quantitatively confirm these results in detail. The onset of
self-field dissipation is, unexpectedly, thermodynamic in character and the

  - Under popular hardness hypotheses, there can be no significantly better

  - Nearly optimal partially dynamic (incremental/decremental) algorithms can
be achieved via efficient reductions to (incremental/decremental) maintenance

$(3/2+\epsilon)$-approximation to Diameter in directed or undirected graphs can
be maintained decrementally in total time $m^{1+o(1)}\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2$. This
nearly matches the static $3/2$-approximation algorithm for the problem that is

process conditioned on a set of nuclear-theoretic models. These synthetic EOSs
are causal and thermodynamically stable by construction, span a broad region of
the pressure-density plane, and can be selected to satisfy astrophysical
constraints on the NS mass. Associating every synthetic EOS with a pair of
component masses $M_{1,2}$ and calculating the corresponding tidal
deformabilities $\Lambda_{1,2}$, we perform Monte Carlo integration over the GW
likelihood for $M_{1,2}$ and $\Lambda_{1,2}$ to directly infer a posterior
process for the NS EOS. We first demonstrate that the method can accurately
recover an injected GW signal, and subsequently use it to analyze data from
GW170817, finding a canonical deformability of $\Lambda_{1.4} =
160^{+448}_{-113}$ and $p(2\rho_{\mathrm{nuc}})=1.35^{+1.8}_{-1.2}\times
10^{34}~\mathrm{dyn}/\mathrm{cm}^2$ for the pressure at twice the nuclear
saturation density at 90$\%$ confidence, in agreement with previous studies,

factor between the two priors is $B^{\mathcal{A}}_{\mathcal{I}} \simeq 1.12$,

demonstrated to be a robust technique in such applications, where the flow of
particles in a curvilinear geometry has proven to be particularly advantageous,
not only because the geometry can reduce the foot-print of a lab-on-chip
device, but also because the coupling of secondary Dean flows to inertial
forces allows for exquisite particle manipulations. However, the ability to
design a curvilinear channel for a specific application is often based on
empirical results, as theoretical models to date typically do not include the
effects of a finite sized particle within the flow. Here we present a complete
numerical model that directly simulates a particle within a confide curvilinear

behavior of inertial particles as well as the applicability of the point
particle assumptions previous researchers have proposed. Finally, we propose a
new model that takes into account the full physics, but relies on a
perturbation expansion of the lateral forces, where the perturbation parameter
is the curvature ratio of the channel. This simple model can be used to predict
the behavior of particles in complex channel geometries where the curvature may

the problem, Bayesian neural networks often require more time and computational
power to train than deterministic networks. Our work explores whether fully
Bayesian networks are needed to successfully capture model uncertainty. We vary
the number and position of Bayesian layers in a network and compare their
performance on active learning with the MNIST dataset. We found that we can
fully capture the model uncertainty by using only a few Bayesian layers near
the output of the network, combining the advantages of deterministic and
Bayesian networks.

subpopulations in a single tumor, has been a major puzzle in cancer research
for almost half a century. The lack of understanding of the underlying
mechanism of ITH hinders progress in developing effective therapies for
cancers. Based on the findings in a recent quantitative experiment on
pancreatic cancer, we developed a general evolutionary model for one type of
cancer, accounting for interactions between different cell populations through
paracrine or juxtacrine factors. We show that the emergence of a stable
heterogeneous state in a tumor requires an unequal allocation of paracrine
growth factors (""public goods"") between cells that produce them and those that
merely consume them. Our model provides a quantitative explanation of recent
{\it in vitro} experimental studies in pancreatic cancer in which insulin
growth factor (IGF-II) plays the role of public goods. The calculated phase
diagrams as a function of exogenous resources and fraction of growth factor
producing cells show ITH persists only in a narrow range of concentration of
exogenous IGF-II. Remarkably, maintenance of ITH requires cooperation among
tumor cell subpopulations in harsh conditions, specified by lack of exogenous
IGF-II, whereas surplus exogenous IGF-II elicits competition. Our theory also
quantitatively accounts for measured {\it in vivo} tumor growth in glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM). The predictions for GBM tumor growth as a function of the
fraction of tumor cells are amenable to experimental tests. The mechanism for
ITH also provides hints for devising efficacious therapies.

hybrid AC/DC microgrids involving multiple distributed generations (e.g.,
Photovoltaic (PV) system, battery storage, diesel generator). Conventional
control strategies usually produce large disturbances to buses during charging
and discharging (C&D) processes of UCs, which significantly degrades the power
quality and system performance, especially under fast C&D modes. Therefore, the
optimal control theory is adopted to optimize the C&D profile as well as to
suppress the disturbances caused by UCs implementation. Specifically, an
NN-based intelligent algorithm is developed to learn the optimal control policy
for bidirectional-converter-interfaced UCs. The inaccuracies of system modeling
are also considered in the control design. Since the designed NN-OPT method is
decentralized that only requires the local measurements, plug & play of UCs can
be easily realized with minimal communication efforts. In addition, the PV
system is under the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control to extract the
maximum benefit. Both islanded and grid-tied modes are considered during the
controller design. Extensive case studies have been conducted to evaluate the

best general upper bound known for this number remains as it was more than
sixty years ago, of the order of ${2n \choose n}n\ln n$.
  In this note, we improve this bound by a sub-exponential factor. That is, we
prove a bound of the order of ${2n \choose n}e^{-c\sqrt{n}}$ for some universal

  Our approach combines ideas from previous work by Artstein-Avidan and the

key steps is proving a new lower bound for the maximum volume of the
intersection of a convex body $K$ with a translate of $-K$; in fact, we get the
same lower bound for the volume of the intersection of $K$ and $-K$ when they
both have barycenter at the origin. To do so, we make use of measure
concentration, and in particular of thin-shell estimates for isotropic
log-concave measures.

$N\left(n\right)$ when restricting our attention to convex bodies that are
$\psi_{2}$. By a slightly different approach, an exponential improvement is
established also for classes of convex bodies with positive modulus of

equivalent to the \Problem{$(\min, +)$ convolution} problem, which is thought
to be facing a quadratic-time barrier. This hardness is in contrast to the more
famous \Problem{$(+, \cdot)$ convolution} (generally known as
\Problem{polynomial multiplication}), that has an $O(n\log n)$-time solution
via Fast Fourier Transform.
  Our main results are algorithms with near-linear running times (in terms of
the size of the knapsack and the number of items) for the \Problem{knapsack}
problem, if either the values or sizes of items are small integers. More
specifically, if item sizes are integers bounded by $\smax$, the running time
of our algorithm is $\tilde O((n+t)\smax)$. If the item values are integers
bounded by $\vmax$, our algorithm runs in time $\tilde O(n+t\vmax)$. Best
previously known running times were $O(nt)$, $O(n^2\smax)$ and $O(n\smax\vmax)$
(Pisinger, J. of Alg., 1999).

  Policies",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work presents a novel ensemble of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for
control of safety-critical systems. Decision making for safety-critical systems
is challenging due to performance requirements with significant consequences in
the event of failure. In practice, failure of such systems can be avoided by
introducing redundancies of control. Neural Networks (NNs) are generally not
used for safety-critical systems as they can behave in unexpected ways in
response to novel inputs. In addition, there may not be any indication as to
when they will fail. BNNs have been recognized for their ability to produce not
only viable outputs but also provide a measure of uncertainty in these outputs.
This work combines the knowledge of prediction uncertainty obtained from BNNs
and ensemble control for a redundant control methodology. Our technique is
applied to an agile autonomous driving task. Multiple BNNs are trained to
control a vehicle in an end-to-end fashion on different sensor inputs provided
by the system. We show that an individual network is successful in maneuvering
around the track but crashes in the presence of unforeseen input noise. Our
proposed ensemble of BNNs shows successful task performance even in the event
of multiple sensor failures.

in more efficient communication topologies for improved learning. This is an
important problem because a common technique to improve speed and robustness of
learning in deep reinforcement learning and many other machine learning
algorithms is to run multiple learning agents in parallel. The standard
communication architecture typically involves all agents intermittently
communicating with each other (fully connected topology) or with a centralized
server (star topology). Unfortunately, optimizing the topology of communication
over the space of all possible graphs is a hard problem, so we borrow results
from the networked optimization and collective intelligence literatures which
suggest that certain families of network topologies can lead to strong
improvements over fully-connected networks. We start by introducing alternative
network topologies to DRL benchmark tasks under the Evolution Strategies
paradigm which we call Network Evolution Strategies. We explore the relative
performance of the four main graph families and observe that one such family
(Erdos-Renyi random graphs) empirically outperforms all other families,
including the de facto fully-connected communication topologies. Additionally,
the use of alternative network topologies has a multiplicative performance
effect: we observe that when 1000 learning agents are arranged in a carefully
designed communication topology, they can compete with 3000 agents arranged in
the de facto fully-connected topology. Overall, our work suggests that
distributed machine learning algorithms would learn more efficiently if the
communication topology between learning agents was optimized.

Galaxy. It is well-known for its relativistic baryonic jets, but the system
also drives equatorial outflows. These have been routinely detected in radio
images, and components associated with a circumbinary disk have also been
suggested in optical emission lines. We wish to spatially resolve the regions
producing the stationary emission lines of SS 433 to shed light on its
circumbinary structure and outflows. With an estimated binary orbit size
$\lesssim 0.1 \text{ mas}$, this requires optical interferometry. We use the
optical interferometer VLTI+GRAVITY to spatially resolve SS 433 in the
near-infrared K band at high spectral resolution ($R\approx 4000$) on three
nights in July 2017. The stationary Br$\gamma$ line is clearly dominated by an
extended $\sim 1 \text{ mas} \sim 5 \text{ AU}$ circumbinary structure
perpendicular to the jets and with a strong rotation component. The rotation
direction is retrograde relative to the jet precession, in accordance with the
slaved disk precession model. The structure has a very high specific angular
momentum and is too extended to be a stable circumbinary disk in Keplerian
rotation; interpreting it as such leads to a very high enclosed mass $M \gtrsim
400 M_{\odot}$. We instead interpret it as the centrifugal ejection of the
circumbinary disk, with the implication that there must be an efficient
transfer of specific angular momentum from the binary to the disk. We suggest
that the equatorial outflows sometimes seen in radio images result from similar
episodes of circumbinary disk centrifugal ejection. In addition to the
equatorial structure, we find a very extended $\sim 6 \text{ mas} \sim 30
\text{ AU}$ spherical wind component to the Br$\gamma$ line: the entire binary
is engulfed in an optically thin spherical line emission envelope.

decomposition (DMD) which provides a non-orthogonal set of modes ---
corresponding to particular temporal frequencies --- a subset of which is used
to represent time snapshots of the underlying dynamics. The coefficients of the
representation are determined from a solution of a structured linear least
squares problem with the matrix that involves the Khatri--Rao product of a
triangular and a Vandermonde matrix. Such a structure allows a very efficient
normal equation based least squares solution, which is used in state of the art
CFD tools such as the sparsity promoting DMD (DMDSP). A new numerical analysis
of the normal equations approach provides insights about its applicability and
its limitations. Relevant condition numbers that determine numerical robustness
are identified and discussed. Further, the paper offers a corrected semi-normal
solution and QR factorization based algorithms. It is shown how to use the
Vandermonde--Khatri--Rao structure to efficiently compute the QR factorization
of the least squares coefficient matrix, thus providing a new computational
tool for the ill-conditioned cases where the normal equations may fail to
compute a sufficiently accurate solution. Altogether, the presented material
provides a firm numerical linear algebra framework for a class of structured
least squares problems arising in a variety of applications.

close to the compact object. The optical interferometer VLTI/GRAVITY has
allowed to spatially resolved the optical jets in SS 433 for the first time. We
present here the second such observation taken over three nights in July 2017.
In addition, we use the multi-wavelength XSHOOTER spectrograph at VLT to study
the optical bullets in SS 433 in detail. GRAVITY reveals elongated
exponential-like spatial profiles for the optical jets, suggestive of a heating
mechanism acting throughout a long portion of the jet and naturally explained
by photoionization by the collimated radiation. We also spatially resolve the
movement of the optical bullets for the first time, detecting extended jet
components corresponding to previous ejections. \texttt{Cloudy} photoionization
models explain both the spatial intensity profiles measured with GRAVITY and
the line ratios from XSHOOTER, and constrain the properties of the optical
bullets and the ionizing radiation. We find that the latter must peak in the UV
with an isotropic luminosity (as inferred by a face on observer) $\approx
10^{41}$ erg/s. Provided that the X-ray SED is sufficiently hard, the
collimated X-ray luminosity could still be high enough so that the face on
observer would see SS 433 as an ULX ($L_X \lesssim 10^{40}$ erg/s) and it would
still be compatible with the H/He/He+ ionization balance of the optical
bullets. The kinetic power in the optical jets is constrained to $3-20 \times
10^{38}$ erg/s, and the extinction in the optical jets to $A_V = 6.7 \pm 0.1$.
We suggest there may be substantial $A_V \gtrsim 1$ and structured
circumstellar extinction in SS 433, likely arising from dust formed in
equatorial outflows.

  reaction-diffusion model with strong Allee effect","29 pages, 3 figures","J. Differential Equations, 2019",,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that a species dies out in the long run for small initial data if
its evolution obeys a reaction of bistable nonlinearity. Such a phenomenon,
which is termed as the strong Allee effect, is well supported by numerous
evidence from ecosystems, mainly due to the environmental pollution as well as
unregulated harvesting and hunting. To save an endangered species, in this
paper we introduce a protection zone that is governed by a Fisher-KPP
nonlinearity, and examine the dynamics of a reaction-diffusion model with
strong Allee effect and protection zone. We show the existence of two critical
values $0<L_*\leq L^*$, and prove that a vanishing-transition-spreading
trichotomy result holds when the length of protection zone is smaller than
$L_*$; a transition-spreading dichotomy result holds when the length of
protection zone is between $L_*$ and $L^*$; only spreading happens when the
length of protection zone is larger than $L^*$. This suggests that the
protection zone works when its length is larger than the critical value $L_*$.
Furthermore, we compare two types of protection zone with the same length: a
connected one and a separate one, and our results reveal that the former is
better for species spreading than the latter.

determine the location and the shape of a rigid obstacle from the phased or

the compressional or shear far-field pattern for the elastic wave equation and
the corresponding far-field pattern for the coupled Helmholtz equations. An

proved. A system of nonlinear integral equations is proposed and two iterative

confirm that these are the same for any fixed knot-type $K$. We also confirm
that the entropic exponent for unknots is the same as that of all polygons, and
that the exponent for fixed knot-type $K$ depends only on the number of prime

leads to a good approximation for the polygon size at which the probability of
the given knot-type is maximized, and in some cases we are able to sample

Sanathanan-Koerner iteration and Vector Fitting, to partial interpolation
methods like Adaptive Anderson Antoulas (AAA). While these methods can often
find rational approximations with a small residual norm, they are unable to
find optimizers with respect to a weighted l2 norm with a square dense

constructing rational approximations with respect to this norm. We explore this
approach using two parameterizations of rational functions: a ratio of two

use Variable Projection (VARPRO) to reduce the dimension of the optimization
problem. As many applications seek a real rational approximation that can be
described as a ratio of two real polynomials, we show how this constraint can
be enforced in both parameterizations. Although this nonlinear least squares
approach often converge to suboptimal local minimizers, we find this can be
largely mitigated by initializing the algorithm using the poles of the AAA
algorithm applied to the same data. This combination of initialization and
nonlinear least squares enables us to construct rational approximants using

significant time constraints -- in such settings, rather than spending
significant amounts of time solving for optimal paths, it is instead preferable
to find valid collision-free paths quickly, even if suboptimal, and given
additional time, to iteratively refine such paths to improve their cost. In
such domains, we observe that agent-agent collisions are sparse -- they involve
small local subsets of agents, and are geographically contained within a small
region of the overall space.
  Leveraging this insight, we can first plan paths for each agent individually,
and in the cases of collisions between agents, perform small local repairs
limited to local subspace windows. As time permits, these windows can be
successively grown and the repairs within them refined, thereby improving the
path quality, and eventually converging to the global joint optimal solution.
Using these insights, we present two algorithmic contributions: 1) the Windowed
Anytime Multiagent Planning Framework (WAMPF) for a class of anytime planners
that quickly generate valid paths with suboptimality estimates and generate
optimal paths given sufficient time, and 2) X*, an efficient WAMPF-based
planner. X* is able to efficiently find successive valid solutions by employing
re-use techniques during the repair growth step of WAMPF.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that in sparse domains: 1) X* outperforms
state-of-the-art anytime or optimal MAPF solvers in time to valid path, 2) X*
is competitive with state-of-the-art anytime or optimal MAPF solvers in time to
optimal path, 3) X* quickly converges to very tight suboptimality bounds, and
4) X* is competitive with state-of-the-art suboptimal MAPF solvers in time to

binary pixel classification problem, which is similar in spirit to
learning-based edge detection, as well as to semantic segmentation methods. In
the present article, we depart from this strategy by training a CNN to predict
a two-dimensional vector field, which maps each scene point to a candidate
skeleton pixel, in the spirit of flux-based skeletonization algorithms. This
""image context flux"" representation has two major advantages over previous
approaches. First, it explicitly encodes the relative position of skeletal
pixels to semantically meaningful entities, such as the image points in their
spatial context, and hence also the implied object boundaries. Second, since
the skeleton detection context is a region-based vector field, it is better
able to cope with object parts of large width. We evaluate the proposed method
on three benchmark datasets for skeleton detection and two for symmetry
detection, achieving consistently superior performance over state-of-the-art

photons is studied. The general formulas connecting the radiation probability
distribution of twisted photons produced by bunches of identical particles with
the radiation probability distribution of twisted photons generated by one
particle are obtained for axially symmetric bunches. The bunch is called
axially symmetric if it is axially symmetric with respect to the detector axis
at some instant of time and all the particles in the bunch move along parallel
trajectories. The general sum rules for the probability of radiation of twisted
photons by axially symmetric bunches are established. In particular, we prove
that the projection of the average total angular momentum of radiated twisted
photons per particle in the bunch does not depend on the radial profile of the
bunch. The uniform, Gaussian, and exponential radial bunch profiles are
considered in detail. The radiation of axially symmetric bunches in ordinary
and crystalline undulators is investigated. The selection rules for radiation
of twisted photons by one particle in undulators are violated when the finite
width of the particle bunch is taken into account. We find the condition when
this violation is marginal. The form of the radiation probability distribution
of twisted photons becomes universal for wide incoherent axially symmetric
particle bunches. We completely describe these universal distributions.

a direct procedure to construct holographic images of the black hole in the

function with respect to an external source corresponds to the asymptotic data
of the bulk field generated by the source on the AdS boundary. According to the
wave optics, we can obtain the images from the bulk field propagating in the
bulk spacetime. For a thermal state on two-dimensional sphere dual to
Schwarzschild-AdS$_4$ black hole, we demonstrate that the holographic images
gravitationally lensed by the black hole can be constructed from the response
function. In particular, the Einstein rings on the image can be clearly
observed and their radius depends on the total energy of the QFT thermal state.
These results are consistent with the size of the photon sphere of the black
hole calculated in geometrical optics. This implies that, if there exists a
dual gravitational picture for a given quantum system, we would be able to
probe existence of the dual black hole by the Einstein rings constructed from

is formulated subject to both per-antenna power constraints and
quality-of-service (QoS) constraints under the NOMA principal. The problem is a
non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program, and the conventional
semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation is not tight. In order to tackle the
non-convex NOMA beamforming problem, we construct a second-order cone
approximation for each signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
constraint and form an iterative algorithm, in which a sequence of second-order
cone programs (SOCPs) are solved. The optimal values of the sequence of SOCPs
are non-increasing, and it converges to a locally optimal value. However, our
extensive simulation results show that the locally optimal value is more or
less as good as the globally optimal value. In particular, we show that the SDP
relaxation is tight for two-user case if one of the SINR constraints is strict

quenching of very high-energy electron acceleration; for young SNRs, this
energy loss timescale is shorter than the age of SNRs implying continuous
electon acceleration at the cutoff energy; and for a few old age SNRs, the

escaping of higher energy particles from SNRs. Finally, we comment on the

individuals to obtain an accurate estimation of some statistic of a population,

is unknown to the data analyst, to acquire and report his data. The cost can be
arbitrarily correlated with the data. The data analyst has an expected budget
that she can use to incentivize individuals to provide their data. The goal is
to design a joint acquisition-estimation mechanism to optimize the performance
of the produced estimator, without any prior information on the underlying
distribution of cost and data. We investigate two types of estimations:
unbiased point estimation and confidence interval estimation.
  Unbiased estimators: We design a truthful, individually rational, online
mechanism to acquire data from individuals and output an unbiased estimator of
the population mean when the data analyst has no prior information on the
cost-data distribution and individuals arrive in a random order. The
performance of this mechanism matches that of the optimal mechanism, which
knows the true cost distribution, within a constant factor. The performance of
an estimator is evaluated by its variance under the worst-case cost-data
correlation.
  Confidence intervals: We characterize an approximately optimal (within a
factor $2$) mechanism for obtaining a confidence interval of the population
mean when the data analyst knows the true cost distribution at the beginning.
This mechanism is efficiently computable. We then design a truthful,
individually rational, online algorithm that is only worse than the
approximately optimal mechanism by a constant factor. The performance of an
estimator is evaluated by its expected length under the worst-case cost-data

preemptive scheduling to minimize the makespan on unrelated machines. The
problem of minimizing the total (weighted) completion time is considerably
harder, even on a single machine. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that
computes for any given sequence of jobs an optimal schedule, i.e., the optimal

of the structure of optimal solutions and a potential function argument. With
this algorithm, we solve the unweighted problem optimally in polynomial time.

develop a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) based on a dual

estimated three-dimensional (3D) geometries in two images of different
individuals. However, the estimation of 3D geometries along with different
lighting conditions using 3DMMs is still a difficult task. We herein represent
the face region with a latent variable that is assigned with the proposed deep
neural network (DNN) instead of facial textures. The proposed DNN synthesizes a
face-swapped image using the latent variable of the face region and another
image of the non-face region. The proposed method is not required to fit to the
3DMM; additionally, it performs face swapping only by feeding two face images
to the proposed network. Consequently, our DNN-based face swapping performs
better than previous approaches for challenging inputs with different face
orientations and lighting conditions. Through several experiments, we
demonstrated that the proposed method performs face swapping in a more stable
manner than the state-of-the-art method, and that its results are compatible

equations. However, there are few progresses except in a simply connected
complete Riemannian manifold with nonpositive curvature. We propose a kind of
complete Riemannian metrics in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is called as escape
metrics. We expose the relationship between escape metrics and geodesics escape
in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Under the escape metric $g$, we prove that each geodesic of
$(\mathbb{R}^n,g)$ escapes, that is, $\lim_{t\rightarrow +\infty} |\gamma
(t)|=+\infty$ for any $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and any unit-speed geodesic $\gamma
(t)$ starting at $x$. We also obtain the geodesics escape velocity and give the
counterexample that if escape metrics are not satisfied, then there exists an
unit-speed geodesic $\gamma (t)$ such that $\overline{\lim}_{t\rightarrow
+\infty} |\gamma (t)|<+\infty$. In addition, we establish Morawetz multipliers
in Riemannian geometry to derive dispersive estimates for the wave equation on
an exterior domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with an escape metric. More concretely,
for radial solutions, the uniform decay rate of the local energy is independent
of the parity of the dimension $n$. For general solutions, we prove the
space-time estimation of the energy and uniform decay rate $t^{-1}$ of the
local energy. It is worth pointing out that different from the assumption of an
Euclidean metric at infinity in the existing studies, escape metrics are more
general Riemannian metrics.

large number of change requests by modifying existing code or adding code into
the system. An efficient tackling of change request calls for an accurate
localising of software changes, i.e. identifying which code are problematic and
where new files should be added for any type of change request at hand, such as
a bug report or a feature request. Existing automatic techniques for this
change localisation problem are limited in two aspects: on the one hand, they
are only limited to tackle a specific type of change request; on the other
hand, they are focused on finding files that should be modified for a change
request, yet barely capable of recommending what files or packages might be
newly created. To address the limitations, we are inspired to propose a
generalised change localisation approach to identify the to-be-modified files
(mostly for bugs), and at the same time point out where new files or packages
should be created (mostly for new feature requests) for an arbitrary type of
change request. In order to tackle the key challenge of predicting
to-be-created program elements, our proposed SeekChanges approach leverages the
hierarchical package structure for Java projects, and model the change
localisation problem as a structured information retrieval (IR) task. A
systematic investigation of three structured IR strategies is carried out for
scoring and ranking both the files that should be modified and the software
packages in which the new files should be created to address change requests.
Extensive experiments on four open source Java projects from the Apache
Software Foundation demonstrate that structured IR strategies have a good
performance on recommending newly created files, while the overall performance
of localising change requests is equally satisfactory.

paired training data, e.g. faithfully transferring the exact mustache from a
source face to a target face. This is a more challenging task than the
conventional semantic-level attribute transfer, which only preserves the
generic attribute style instead of instance-level traits. We propose the use of
geometry-aware flow, which serves as a well-suited representation for modeling
the transformation between instance-level facial attributes. Specifically, we
leverage the facial landmarks as the geometric guidance to learn the
differentiable flows automatically, despite of the large pose gap existed.
Geometry-aware flow is able to warp the source face attribute into the target
face context and generate a warp-and-blend result. To compensate for the
potential appearance gap between source and target faces, we propose a
hallucination sub-network that produces an appearance residual to further
refine the warp-and-blend result. Finally, a cycle-consistency framework
consisting of both attribute transfer module and attribute removal module is
designed, so that abundant unpaired face images can be used as training data.
Extensive evaluations validate the capability of our approach in transferring
instance-level facial attributes faithfully across large pose and appearance
gaps. Thanks to the flow representation, our approach can readily be applied to
generate realistic details on high-resolution images.

between domains of opposite magnetisation are fractal on every lengthscale, but
with different properties at short or long distances. Specifically, on
lengthscales larger than the typical domains' size the topology is that of
critical random percolation, similarly to what observed in clean systems or
models with different kinds of quenched disorder. On smaller lengthscales a
dilution dependent fractal dimension emerges. The Hausdorff dimension increases
with increasing dilution $d$ up to the value $4/3$ expected at the bond
percolation threshold $d=1/2$. We discuss how such different geometries develop
on different lengthscales during the phase-ordering process and how their
simultaneous presence determines the scaling properties of observable

the quotient procedure of Duval et al. is extended to gravitational waves

generalise the embedding procedure to a larger class of Carrollian manifolds

properties of Co-rich spin gapless semiconductor CoFeCrGa using both

$\mathrm{Co_{1+x}Fe_{1-x}CrGa}$ is the high Curie temperature (T$\mathrm{_C}$)
and magnetization, without compromising the SGS nature (up to x = 0.4), and
hence our choice. The quaternary Heusler alloys $\mathrm{Co_{1+x}Fe_{1-x}CrGa}$
(x = 0.1 to 0.5) are found to crystallize in LiMgPdSn-type structure having
space group $F\bar{4}3m$ (\# 216). The measured Curie temperature increases
from 690 K (x = 0) to 870 K (x = 0.5). Observed magnetization values follow the
Slater-Pauling rule. Measured electrical resistivity, in the temperature range
of 5-350 K, suggests that the alloys retain the SGS behavior up to x = 0.4,
beyond which it reflects metallic character. Unlike conventional
semiconductors, the conductivity value ($\mathrm{\sigma_{xx}}$) at 300 K lies
in the range of 2289 S $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ to 3294 S $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which
is close to that of other reported SGS materials. The anomalous Hall effect is
comparatively low. The intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall
conductivity increase with x, which can be correlated with the enhancement in
chemical order. The anomalous Hall coefficient is found to increase from 38
S/cm for x = 0.1 to 43 S/cm for 0.3. Seebeck coefficients turn out to be
vanishingly small below 300 K, another signature for being SGS. All the alloys
(for different x) are found to be both chemically and thermally stable.
Simulated magnetization agrees fairly with the experiment. As such Co-rich
CoFeCrGa is a promising candidate for room temperature spintronic applications,
with enhanced T$\mathrm{_C}$, magnetic properties and SGS nature.

Regarding binocular incongruity, visual comfort zone, window violation,
binocular rivalry, and accommodation-vergence conflict of human visual system

occurring near the central engine, which is mostly inaccessible to our direct
view. Such signals provide insights into various aspect of blazar studies
including disk-jet connection, magnetic field configuration and, more
importantly, strong gravity near the supermassive black holes and release of
gravitational waves from the binary supermassive black hole systems. In this
work, we report detection of a periodic signal in the radio light curve of the
blazar J1043+2408 spanning $\sim$10.5 years. We performed multiple methods of
time series analysis, namely, epoch folding, Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and
discrete auto-correlation function. All three methods consistently reveal a
repeating signal with a periodicity of $\sim560$ days. To robustly account for
the red-noise processes usually dominant in the blazar variability and other
possible artifacts, a large number of Monte Carlo simulations were performed.
This allowed us to estimate a high significance (99.9\% local and 99.4\%
global) against possible spurious detection. As possible explanations, we
discuss a number of scenarios including binary supermassive black hole system,

deterministic models. In order to generate a probabilistic forecast, a model
needs to be run several times sampling the input parameter space, in order to
generate an ensemble from which the distribution of outputs can be inferred.
However, ensemble simulations are costly and often preclude the possibility of
real-time forecasting. We introduce a simple and robust method to generate
uncertainties from deterministic models, that does not require ensemble
simulations. The method is based on the simple consideration that a
probabilistic forecast needs to be both accurate and well-calibrated
(reliable). We argue that these two requirements are equally important, and we
introduce the Accuracy-Reliability cost function that quantitatively measures
the trade-off between accuracy and reliability. We then define the optimal
uncertainties as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution that
minimizes the cost function. We demonstrate that this simple strategy,
implemented here by means of a regularized deep neural network, produces
accurate and well-calibrated forecasts, showing examples both on synthetic and
real-world space weather data.

Images belonging to different classes may contain the common visuals and shapes
that can result in the closeness of computed feature space of two different

and image representation is selected with appropriate features as it directly
affects the performance of image retrieval system. The commonly used visual

color and shape features. We selected color moments and color histogram to
represent color while shape is represented by using invariant moments. We
selected this combination, as these features are reported intuitive, compact
and robust for image representation. We evaluated the performance of our
proposed research by using the Corel, Coil and Ground Truth (GT) image
datasets. We evaluated the proposed low-level feature fusion by calculating the
precision, recall and time required for feature extraction. The precision,
recall and feature extraction values obtained from the proposed low-level
feature fusion outperforms the existing research of CBIR.

the normalized Nusselt number $Nu(\theta_m)/Nu(0)$ and Reynolds number

Presenting a systematic conceptual framework for the leakage problem that

(2) The aim in (1) is developed in the context of experimentation with the TM

particularly promising channels. Here, the QCD--initiated background is absent
for $\pi^0$ due to isospin conservation and very small for $\eta(548)$ due to
its dominantly flavour octet nature and odd parity.

demanding requirements in 5G standards. However, a sharp characterization of
the performance of traditional codes is available only in the large
block-length limit. Guided by such asymptotic analysis, code designs require
large block lengths as well as latency to achieve the desired error rate.
Tail-biting convolutional codes and other recent state-of-the-art short block
codes, while promising reduced latency, are neither robust to channel-mismatch
nor adaptive to varying channel conditions. When the codes designed for one
channel (e.g.,~Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel) are used for
another (e.g.,~non-AWGN channels), heuristics are necessary to achieve
non-trivial performance.

by jointly designing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based encoder and
decoder. This code outperforms canonical convolutional code under block
settings. We then leverage this experience to propose a new class of codes

show the potential to design new versatile and universal codes for future

sources, has been studied extensively through apparent intensity pattern
resulting from Fresnel diffraction, and has been successfully used to measure
angular sizes of extragalactic sources. However, such observations to-date have
been mainly over narrow bandwidth, or averaged over the observing band, and the
associated intensity pattern in time has rarely been examined in detail as a
function of frequency over a wide band. Here, we revisit the phenomenon of
lunar occultation with a view to study the associated intensity pattern as a
function of both time and frequency. Through analytical and simulation
approach, we examine the variation of intensity across the dynamic spectra, and
look for chromatic signatures which could appear as discrete dispersed signal
tracks, when the diffraction pattern is adequately smoothed by a finite source
size. We particularly explore circumstances in which such diffraction pattern
might closely follow the interstellar dispersion law followed by pulsars and
transients, such as the Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), which remain a mystery even
after a decade of their discovery. In this paper, we describe details of this
investigation, relevant to radio frequencies at which FRBs have been detected,
and discuss our findings, along with their implications. We also show how a
band-averaged light curve suffers from temporal smearing, and consequent
reduction in contrast of intensity variation, with increasing bandwidth. We

relevant literature from 1997 until the end of 2017 and identified 403 relevant
papers, 274 of which were selected for analysis based on quality criteria. This
study derives a customized research strategy from established systematic
approaches in the literature. We have utilized an exhaustive 3-tier search
strategy to ensure a high degree of completeness during the study collection
and used a test set to evaluate our search. The first 3 research questions
address the demographics of security pattern research such as topic
classification, trends, and distribution between academia and industry, along
with prominent researchers and venues. The next 9 research questions focus on
more in-depth analyses such as pattern presentation notations and
classification criteria, pattern evaluation techniques, and pattern usage

low-mass exoplanets using the radial-velocity (RV) technique. We propose to
estimate the variations in shape of the CCF by fitting a Skew Normal (SN)
density which, unlike the commonly employed Normal density, includes a skewness
parameter to capture the asymmetry of the CCF induced by stellar activity and
the convective blueshift. The performances of the proposed method are compared
to the commonly employed Normal density using both simulations and real
observations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio. When
considering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry
of the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using
the parameters estimated with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with
the commonly employed Normal density. Using the proposed SN approach, the
uncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are on
average 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the
Normal. The uncertainties estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on
average 15% smaller than the uncertainties measured on the Bisector Inverse
Slope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate the
asymmetry of the CCF. We also propose a new model to account for stellar
activity when fitting a planetary signal to RV data. Based on simple
simulations, we were able to demonstrate that this new model improves the
planetary detection limits by 12% compared to the model commonly used to
account for stellar activity. The SN density is a better model than the Normal
density for characterizing the CCF since the correlations used to probe stellar
activity are stronger and the uncertainties of the RV estimate and the
asymmetry of the CCF are both smaller.

  Sampling:Convergence Analysis and Enhancement","Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sampling from lattice Gaussian distribution has emerged as an important
problem in coding, decoding and cryptography. In this paper, the classic Gibbs
algorithm from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is demonstrated to be
geometrically ergodic for lattice Gaussian sampling, which means the Markov
chain arising from it converges exponentially fast to the stationary
distribution. Meanwhile, the exponential convergence rate of Markov chain is
also derived through the spectral radius of forward operator. Then, a
comprehensive analysis regarding to the convergence rate is carried out and two
sampling schemes are proposed to further enhance the convergence performance.
The first one, referred to as Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MWG) algorithm, improves
the convergence by refining the state space of the univariate sampling. On the
other hand, the blocked strategy of Gibbs algorithm, which performs the
sampling over multivariate at each Markov move, is also shown to yield a better
convergence rate than the traditional univariate sampling. In order to perform
blocked sampling efficiently, Gibbs-Klein (GK) algorithm is proposed, which
samples block by block using Klein's algorithm. Furthermore, the validity of GK
algorithm is demonstrated by showing its ergodicity. Simulation results based
on MIMO detections are presented to confirm the convergence gain brought by the
proposed Gibbs sampling schemes.

it often requires to identify correct quality assessment procedures.
  Since data is often derived from autonomous, and increasingly large data
sources, it is impractical to manually curate the data, and challenging to
continuously and automatically assess their quality.
  In this paper, we explore two main areas of quality assessment related to
evolving knowledge bases: (i) identification of completeness issues using
knowledge base evolution analysis, and (ii) identification of consistency
issues based on integrity constraints, such as minimum and maximum cardinality,
and range constraints.
  For completeness analysis, we use data profiling information from consecutive
knowledge base releases to estimate completeness measures that allow predicting
quality issues. Then, we perform consistency checks to validate the results of
the completeness analysis using integrity constraints and learning models.
  The approach has been tested both quantitatively and qualitatively by using a
subset of datasets from both DBpedia and 3cixty knowledge bases. The
performance of the approach is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score.
From completeness analysis, we observe a 94% precision for the English DBpedia
KB and 95% precision for the 3cixty Nice KB. We also assessed the performance
of our consistency analysis by using five learning models over three sub-tasks,
namely minimum cardinality, maximum cardinality, and range constraint. We
observed that the best performing model in our experimental setup is the Random

two-planet model requires that one or both of the planets require highly
eccentric orbits, that is, $e \geq$ 0.4. Such multiple planet orbits are
considered to be unstable. Whilst our new observations are consistent with two
cyclic variations as previously predicted, significant residuals remain. We
conclude that either additional cyclic terms, possibly associated with more

to the eclipse time variations. Further long-term monitoring is required.

propagation of fast-mode MHD waves of different initial amplitudes and their

We find that this interaction results in, first, the formation of reflected,
traversing and transmitted waves (collectively, secondary waves) and, second,
in the appearance of stationary features at the CH boundary. Moreover, we
observe a density depletion that is moving in the opposite direction to the
incoming wave. We find a correlation between the initial amplitude of the
incoming wave and the amplitudes of the secondary waves as well as the peak
values of the stationary features. Additionally, we compare the phase speed of
the secondary waves and the lifetime of the stationary features to
observations. Both effects obtained in the simulation, the evolution of
secondary waves, as well as the formation of stationary fronts at the CH
boundary, strongly support the theory that coronal waves are fast-mode MHD
waves.

dynamo action. In many cases these fields exhibit organisation on a scale
larger than that of the underlying turbulent flow (e.g., the eleven-year solar
cycle). The mechanism for the generation of so-called large scale fields
remains an open problem. In cases where the magnetic Reynolds number ($Rm$) is
small, dynamo-generated fields are coherent but at (the astrophysically
relevant) high $Rm$, the fields are overwhelmed by small scale fluctuating
field. Recently Tobias and Cattaneo (2013) have shown that an imposed large
scale shear flow can suppress the small scale fluctuations and allow the large
scale temporal behaviour to emerge. Shear is also believed to modify the
electromotive force by introducing correlations between the flow and the field.
However in previous models at high $Rm$ the shear is often artificially imposed
or driven by an arbitrary body force. Here we consider a simple kinematic model
of a convective dynamo in which shear is self consistently driven by the
presence of a horizontal temperature gradient (resulting in a thermal wind) and
a rotation vector that is oblique to gravity. By considering a
$2.5$-dimensional system, we are able to reach high $Rm$ so that the dynamo
approaches the asymptotic regime where the growth rate becomes approximately
independent of $Rm$. We find the flows studied here to be excellent small-scale
dynamos, but with very little systematic behaviour evident at large $Rm$. We
attribute this to being unable to self-consistently generate flows with both
large (net) helicity and strong shear in this setup.

moving (PTM) are common methodologies to quantify foraging behaviour. Hundreds
of studies have reported these indices without specifying the temporal
resolution of their original data, despite the likelihood that the minimal stop
and move durations can affect MPM and PTM estimates. Our goal was to
empirically determine the sensitivity of these foraging indices to changes in
the temporal resolution of the observation. We used a high speed camera to
record movement sequences of 20 Acanthodactylus boskianus lizards. We gradually
decreased the data resolution by ignoring short stops and either ignoring,
elongating or leaving short moves unchanged. We then used the manipulated data
to calculate the foraging indices at different temporal resolutions. We found
that movement-based indices are very sensitive to the observation resolution,
so that realistic variation in the minimal duration of stops and moves could
lead to 68 percent and 48 percent difference in MPM and PTM estimates,
respectively. When using the highest resolution, our estimate of MPM was an
order of magnitude higher than all prior reported values for lizards. Also, the
distribution of stop durations was well described by a single heavy tailed
distribution above 0.35 seconds. This suggests that for A. boskianus there is
no reason to ignore short stops above this threshold. Our results raise major
concerns regarding the use of already published movement based indices, and
enable us to recommend how new foraging data should be collected.

target domain given a labeled source data set and an unlabeled target data set.
To alleviate the effect of `domain shift', the major challenge in domain
adaptation, studies have attempted to align the distributions of the two
domains. Recent research has suggested that generative adversarial network
(GAN) has the capability of implicitly capturing data distribution. In this
paper, we thus propose a simple but effective model for unsupervised domain
adaption leveraging adversarial learning. The same encoder is shared between
the source and target domains which is expected to extract domain-invariant
representations with the help of an adversarial discriminator. With the labeled
source data, we introduce the center loss to increase the discriminative power
of feature learned. We further align the conditional distribution of the two
domains to enforce the discrimination of the features in the target domain.
Unlike previous studies where the source features are extracted with a fixed
pre-trained encoder, our method jointly learns feature representations of two
domains. Moreover, by sharing the encoder, the model does not need to know the
source of images during testing and hence is more widely applicable. We
evaluate the proposed method on several unsupervised domain adaption benchmarks

renormalization. One unexpected finding is that the continuum also appears in
this low-energy branch.

Experimental data have been analyzed in the framework of coupled channels (CC)
calculations using the code CCFULL. The quasi-elastic scattering excitation
function and derived barrier distribution for $^{16}$O + $^{90}$Zr reaction are
well reproduced by the CC calculations using the vibrational coupling strengths
for $^{90}$Zr reported in the literature. Using these vibrational coupling
strengths, a Bayesian analysis is carried out for $^{24}$Mg + $^{90}$Zr
reaction. The $\beta_{2}$ and $\beta_{4}$ values for $^{24}$Mg are determined
to be $+0.43 \pm 0.02$ and $ - 0.11 \pm 0.02$, respectively. The $\beta_{2}$
parameter determined in the present work is in good agreement with results
obtained using inelastic scattering probes. The hexadecapole deformation of

establish that quasi-elastic scattering could provide a useful probe to

suggested to use of the surface entropy, namely the logarithm of the area of a
hypersurface of constant energy in the phase space, as an expression for the
thermodynamic microcanonical entropy, in place of the standard definition
usually known as Boltzmann entropy. In the present manuscript, we have tested
the surface entropy on the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model for which we have computed
the caloric equations that derive from both the Boltzmann entropy and the
surface entropy. The results achieved clearly show that in the case of the
Boltzmann entropy there is a strong dependence of the caloric equation from the
system size, whereas in the case of the surface entropy there is no such
dependence. We infer that the issues that one encounters when the Boltzmann
entropy is used in the statistical description of small systems could be a clue
of a deeper defect of this entropy that derives from its basic definition.
Furthermore, we show that the surface entropy is well founded from a
mathematical point of view, and we show that it is the only admissible entropy
definition, for an isolated and finite system with a given energy, which is
consistent with the postulate of equal a-priori probability.

questions about `Known' visual content. However, their performance drops
significantly when questions about visually and linguistically `Unknown'
concepts are presented during inference (`Open-world' scenario). A practical
VQA system should be able to deal with novel concepts in real world settings.
To address this problem, we propose an exemplar-based approach that transfers
learning (i.e., knowledge) from previously `Known' concepts to answer questions
about the `Unknown'. We learn a highly discriminative joint embedding space,
where visual and semantic features are fused to give a unified representation.
Once novel concepts are presented to the model, it looks for the closest match
from an exemplar set in the joint embedding space. This auxiliary information
is used alongside the given Image-Question pair to refine visual attention in a
hierarchical fashion. Since handling the high dimensional exemplars on large
datasets can be a significant challenge, we introduce an efficient matching
scheme that uses a compact feature description for search and retrieval. To
evaluate our model, we propose a new split for VQA, separating Unknown visual
and semantic concepts from the training set. Our approach shows significant
improvements over state-of-the-art VQA models on the proposed Open-World VQA

conducting a qualitative survey with 152 German health insurers. We scanned
their websites with PrivacyScore.org to generate a public ranking and

Responses ranged from positive feedback to legal threats. Only 12% of the sites

local inhomogeneities on the electrical properties of the h-BN and their effect
in electronic devices is unknown. Here it is shown that the electrical
properties of h-BN stacks grown on polycrystalline Pt vary a lot depending on
the crystalline orientation of the Pt grain, but within the same grain the
electrical properties of the h-BN are very homogeneous. The reason is that the
thickness of the CVD-grown h-BN stack is different on each Pt grain. Conductive
atomic force microscopy (CAFM) maps show that the tunneling current across the
h-BN stack fluctuates up to 3 orders of magnitude from one Pt grain to another.
However, probe station experiments reveal that the variability of electronic
devices fabricated within the same Pt grain is surprisingly small. As
cutting-edge electronic devices are ultra-scaled, and as the size of the

$O(m+\log^{2+\epsilon}n)$ time, and locates them in $O(m+(occ+1)\log^\epsilon

studies and is finally receiving positive experimental responses. The issue is
closely related to the thermoelectric and multiferroic (also magnetic)
applications of FE materials, where the electrical conductivity is required or
spurious. In these circumstances, the traditional methods for probing
ferroelectricity are hampered or made totally ineffective by the free charges,
which screen the polar response to an external electric field. This fact may
explain why more than 40 years passed between the first proposals of FE metals

elastic moduli, Young's modulus in the present case, versus temperature is an
effective method for studying the influence of doping on a FE transition
because the elastic properties are unaffected by electrical conductivity. In
this manner, it is shown that the FE transitions of BaTiO3-d are not suppressed
by electron doping through O vacancies; only the onset temperatures are
depressed, but the magnitudes of the softenings, and hence of the piezoelectric

We use these metrics in a non-iterative fashion to obtain the right rank

maintaining sufficient accuracy. Experiments show that our method provides
better compromise between accuracy and computational complexity/memory

network can reduce the FLOPs by 25% and improve accuracy by 0.7% compared to
the baseline, while requiring only 3 minutes on a CPU to search for the right
rank configuration. Previously, similar results were achieved in 4 hours with 8
GPUs. The proposed method can be used for lossless compression of a neural

on probability coupling theory. Our main contributions are summarized as
follows.
  * Built on the formalism of probability coupling theory, we derive an
algorithm framework, named Hierarchical Measure Group and Approximate System
(HMGAS), nicknamed S-System, that is designed to learn the complex
hierarchical, statistical dependency in the physical world.
  * We show that NNs are special cases of S-System when the probability kernels
assume certain exponential family distributions. Activation Functions are
derived formally. We further endow geometry on NNs through information
geometry, show that intermediate feature spaces of NNs are stochastic
manifolds, and prove that ""distance"" between samples is contracted as layers
stack up.
  * S-System shows NNs are inherently stochastic, and under a set of realistic
boundedness and diversity conditions, it enables us to prove that for large
size nonlinear deep NNs with a class of losses, including the hinge loss, all
local minima are global minima with zero loss errors, and regions around the
minima are flat basins where all eigenvalues of Hessians are concentrated
around zero, using tools and ideas from mean field theory, random matrix
theory, and nonlinear operator equations.
  * S-System, the information-geometry structure and the optimization behaviors
combined completes the analog between Renormalization Group (RG) and NNs. It
shows that a NN is a complex adaptive system that estimates the statistic
dependency of microscopic object, e.g., pixels, in multiple scales. Unlike
clear-cut physical quantity produced by RG in physics, e.g., temperature, NNs
renormalize/recompose manifolds emerging through learning/optimization that
divide the sample space into highly semantically meaningful groups that are
dictated by supervised labels (in supervised NNs).

Generative Adversarial Networks that allow our model to be trained with
unpaired data. We demonstrate face editing at very high resolutions (4k images)
with a single forward pass of a deep network at a lower resolution. We also
show that our edits are substantially better at preserving the subject's

image editing results on the Cub200 birds dataset. To our knowledge this has
not been previously accomplished, due the challenging nature of the dataset.

text center-direction (TCD). The TCBP is just like a mountain whose top is text
center and foot is text border. The mountaintop can separate text instances
which cannot be easily achieved using semantic segmentation map and its rising
direction can plan a road to top for each pixel on mountain foot at the group
stage. The TCD helps TCBP learning better. Our label rules will not lead to the
ambiguous problem with the transformation of angle, so the proposed method is
robust to multi-oriented text and can also handle well with curved text. In
inference stage, each pixel at the mountain foot needs to search the path to
the mountaintop and this process can be efficiently completed in parallel,

the finite-temperature numerical results along with the zero-temperature

at zero temperature both the acoustic and optical modes decrease by increasing
the applied electric field and experience a discontinuity at the valley-spin
polarized metal phase as the system transitions from a topological insulator to
a band insulator. At finite temperature, the optical plasmons are damped around
this discontinuity and the acoustic modes may exhibit a continuous transition.
Moreover, while the optical branch of plasmons changes non-monotonically and
noticeably with temperature, the acoustic branch dispersion displays a
negligible growth with temperature for all phases of silicene. Furthermore, our
finite-temperature results indicate that the dependency of two plasmonic

tracked via structure electronic health records (EHRs), oral drug treatment is
self-administered and therefore not tracked as well. Often, the details of oral
cancer treatment occur only in unstructured clinic notes. Extracting this
information is critical to understanding a patient's treatment history. Yet,
this a challenging task because treatment intervals must be inferred
longitudinally from both explicit mentions in the text as well as from document
timestamps. In this work, we present TIFTI (Temporally Integrated Framework for
Treatment Intervals), a robust framework for extracting oral drug treatment
intervals from a patient's unstructured notes. TIFTI leverages distinct sources
of temporal information by breaking the problem down into two separate
subtasks: document-level sequence labeling and date extraction. On a labeled
dataset of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, it exactly matched
the labeled start date in 46% of the examples (86% of the examples within 30
days), and it exactly matched the labeled end date in 52% of the examples (78%
of the examples within 30 days). Without retraining, the model achieved a
similar level of performance on a labeled dataset of advanced non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

model parameters and initial or boundary conditions. The developed stochastic
Galerkin method combines the space-time approximation obtained by a suitable
finite volume method with a spectral-type approximation based on the
generalized polynomial chaos expansion in the stochastic space. The resulting
numerical scheme yields a second-order accurate approximation in both space and
time and exponential convergence in the stochastic space. Our numerical results
demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the stochastic Galerkin method.

perturbed scenarios, for examples, the ones leading to changes in macroscopic
cloud pattern as a shift from hexagonal to rectangular structures.

understood optical variability that consists of periodic and bright optical
outbursts, simultaneous with X-ray outbursts, characterised by a highly
asymmetric profile. The periodicity of the outbursts is thought to correspond
to the orbital period of the neutron star. To understand the behaviour shown by
this source, we performed the first multi-wavelength monitoring campaign during
the periastron passage of December 2017. The monitoring lasted for ~37 days and
consisted of X-ray, near-ultraviolet, and optical data from the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory, the optical I band from the OGLE survey, and spectroscopic
observations of the H-alpha line performed with the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian
Telescope. These observations revealed AX J0049.4-7323 during an anomalous
outburst having remarkably different properties compared to the previous ones.
In the I band, it showed a longer rise timescale (~60 days instead of 1-5 days)
and a longer decay timescale. At the peak of the outburst, it showed a sudden
increase in luminosity in the I band, corresponding to the onset of the X-ray
outburst. The monitoring of the H-alpha emission line showed a fast and highly
variable profile composed of three peaks with variable reciprocal brightness.
We interpreted these results as a circumstellar disc warped by tidal
interactions with the neutron star in a high eccentricity orbit during its
periastron passage. The fast jump in optical luminosity at the peak of the
outburst and the previous asymmetric outbursts might be caused by the
reprocessing of the X-ray photons in the circumstellar disc or the tidal
displacement of a large amount of material from the circumstellar disc or the
outer layers of the donor star during the periastron passage of the neutron
star, which led to an increase in size of the region emitting in the I band.

embeddings in a euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ or on a sphere and which in

problems in this field is to determine lower and upper bounds on the number of
realizations with respect to a given number of vertices. This problem is
closely related to the classification of rigid graphs according to their
maximal number of real embeddings.
  In this paper, we are interested in finding edge lengths that can maximize
the number of real embeddings of minimally rigid graphs in the plane, space,
and on the sphere. We use algebraic formulations to provide upper bounds. To
find values of the parameters that lead to graphs with a large number of real
realizations, possibly attaining the (algebraic) upper bounds, we use some
standard heuristics and we also develop a new method inspired by coupler
curves. We apply this new method to obtain embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^3$. One of
its main novelties is that it allows us to sample efficiently from a larger
number of parameters by selecting only a subset of them at each iteration.
  Our results include a full classification of the 7-vertex graphs according to
their maximal numbers of real embeddings in the cases of the embeddings in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$, while in the case of $S^2$ we achieve this
classification for all 6-vertex graphs. Additionally, by increasing the number
of embeddings of selected graphs, we improve the previously known asymptotic
lower bound on the maximum number of realizations. The methods and the results
concerning the spatial embeddings are part of the proceedings of ISSAC 2018

algorithm, named SVD-Reconstruct, to estimate random missing distances, and the
classic multidimensional scaling (MDS) method to estimate the positions of
nodes. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis for this method. More
specifically, we first establish error bounds for Euclidean distance matrix
(EDM) completion in both expectation and tail forms. Utilizing these results,
we then derive the error bound for the recovered positions of nodes. In order
to assess the performance of SVD-Reconstruct, we present the minimax lower
bound of the zero-diagonal, symmetric, low-rank matrix completion problem by
Fano's method. This result reveals that when the noise level is low, the
SVD-Reconstruct approach for Euclidean distance matrix completion is suboptimal
in the minimax sense; when the noise level is high, SVD-Reconstruct can achieve
the optimal rate up to a constant factor.

randomly perturbed version $\mathbf{M}$ is observed. The noise matrix
$\mathbf{M}-\mathbf{M}^{\star}$ is composed of zero-mean independent (but not
necessarily homoscedastic) entries and is, therefore, not symmetric in general.
This might arise, for example, when we have two independent samples for each
entry of $\mathbf{M}^{\star}$ and arrange them into an {\em asymmetric} data
matrix $\mathbf{M}$. The aim is to estimate the leading eigenvalue and
eigenvector of $\mathbf{M}^{\star}$. We demonstrate that the leading eigenvalue
of the data matrix $\mathbf{M}$ can be $O(\sqrt{n})$ times more accurate --- up
to some log factor --- than its (unadjusted) leading singular value in
eigenvalue estimation. Further, the perturbation of any linear form of the
leading eigenvector of $\mathbf{M}$ --- say, entrywise eigenvector perturbation
--- is provably well-controlled. This eigen-decomposition approach is fully
adaptive to heteroscedasticity of noise without the need of careful bias
correction or any prior knowledge about the noise variance. We also provide
partial theory for the more general rank-$r$ case. The takeaway message is
this: arranging the data samples in an asymmetric manner and performing
eigen-decomposition could sometimes be beneficial.

colour-magnitude diagram. Assuming the recent Gaia Data Release 2 reddening and
main sequence turn off age estimates derived from isochrone fitting, we have
derived progenitor masses and established the cluster initial-final mass
relation. We found consistency with the initial-final mass relation we
established for eight Hyades white dwarfs, also employing Gaia data. We have
investigated also the effect on the derived initial masses of using
self-consistently different sets of stellar models and isochrones for
determining cluster age and white dwarf progenitor lifetimes.
  According to our established Hyades+Praesepe initial-final mass relation,
recent sets of stellar evolution calculation that model the full asymptotic
giant branch phase do on average underpredict the final white dwarf masses, in
the initial mass range covered by the Praesepe and Hyades observed cooling
sequence.
  These results depend crucially on the assumed reddening for the cluster. To
this purpose, we have also discussed the case of considering the traditional
zero reddening for Praesepe, instead of E(B-V)=0.027 derived from isochrone
fitting to the Gaia colour magnitude diagram.

particular, is the effect of major mergers on halo structure. We have performed
a large set of simulations of binary equal-mass mergers between isolated haloes
with various density profiles, to map out the relationship between the initial
conditions and merger parameters and the structure of the final remnant. In
this paper we describe our initial set-up and analysis methods, and report on
the results for the size, shape, and spin of the merger remnant. The outcomes
of mergers are most easily understood in terms of a scaled dimensionless energy
parameter $\kappa$ and an angular momentum (or spin) parameter $\lambda$. We
find that the axis ratio $c/a$ scales roughly linearly with energy $\kappa$
while the axis ratio $c/b$ scales linearly with spin $\lambda$. Qualitatively,
mergers on radial orbits produce prolate remnants, while mergers on tangential
orbits produce oblate remnants. The spin of the remnant can be predicted from
angular momentum conservation, while the overall size changes as $\sim
\kappa^{-5}$, as expected from self-similar scaling at constant mean density.
We discuss potential cosmological applications for these simple patterns.

inviscid and low-viscosity discs, motivated by the connection to laminar,
wind-driven models of protoplanetary discs. Our models unveil the critical role
of vortices in determining the migration behaviour for partial gap-opening
planets. Vortices form in pressure maxima at gap edges, and prevent the
disc-feedback stopping of migration for intermediate planets in low-viscosity
and inviscid discs, contrary to the concept of the `inertial limit' or `disc
feedback' halting predicted from analytical models. Vortices may also form in
the corotation region, and can dramatically modify migration behaviour through
direct gravitational interaction with the planet. These features become
apparent at high resolution, and for all but the highest viscosities there
exist significant difficulties in obtaining numerically converged results. The
migration of partial gap-opening planets, however, clearly becomes chaotic for
sufficiently low viscosities. At moderate viscosity, a smooth disc-feedback
regime is found in which migration can slow substantially, and the migration
time-scale observed corresponds to migration being driven by diffusive
relaxation of the gap edges. At high viscosity classical Type I migration is
recovered. For Jupiter-analogue planets in inviscid discs, a wide, deep gap is
formed. Transient Type II migration occurs over radial length-scales
corresponding to the gap width, beyond which migration can stall. Finally, we
examine the particle trapping driven by structures left in inviscid discs by a
migrating planet, and find that particle traps in the form of multiple rings
and vortices can persist long after the planet has passed. In this case, the
observation of particle traps by submillimetre interferometers such as ALMA
cannot be used to infer the current presence of an adjacent planet.

radius increases, and that the density in their central region drops. Major
mergers seem an obvious mechanism to explain both these phenomena, and the
resulting patterns in the concentration--mass--redshift relation. To test this
possibility, we have simulated equal-mass mergers between haloes with a variety
of cosmological density profiles, placed on various different orbits. The
remnants typically have higher densities than the initial conditions, but
differ only slightly from self-similar scaling predictions. They are reasonably
well fit by Einasto profiles, but have parameters distinct from those of the
initial conditions. The net internal energy available to the merger remnant,
relative to the internal energy of the initial conditions, $\kappa$, has the
greatest influence on the properties of the final mass distribution. As
expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants while mergers of
strongly bound systems produce compact remnants. Surprisingly, however, the
scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend, {\it increasing}
in the remnants of low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Also even
in the most energetic encounters, the density within the scale radius decreases
only slightly (by 10--20\%), while for very low-energy systems it increases
significantly after the merger. We conclude that while major mergers can
produce remnants that are more diffuse at large radii, they are relatively
ineffective at changing the central densities of haloes, and seem unlikely to
explain the mean trends in the concentration--mass--redshift relation.

superconductivity based on well-identified topological insulators. However, the
coexistence of superconductivity and topological state is always arcane. In
this paper, we report how pressure tunes the crystal structure, electronic
structure, and superconductivity in topological insulator Bi2Te2.1Se0.9. The
first pressure-induced structure transition start from 8.4 GPa, followed by the
structure sequence of R-3m - C2/m - C2/c - Im-3m up to 37 GPa.
Superconductivity starts to present at 2.4 GPa with the Tc around 6.6 K.
Moreover, at around 2.5 GPa, the abnormal changes of c/a and the full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of mode indicate the occurrence of electronic topological
transition (ETT). These results suggest that ETT highly promotes the
superconductivity in topological insulator Bi2Te2.1Se0.9 in the low-pressure

Bi2Te2.1Se0.9 and sheds light on the new candidate for superconductivity in

\citep{Bolgiano_1959,Obukhov_1959} phenomenology for moderately stably
stratified turbulence, the energy spectrum in the inertial range shows a dual
scaling; the kinetic energy follows (i) $\sim k^{-11/5}$ for $k < k_B$, and
(ii) $\sim k^{-5/3}$ for $k > k_B$, where $k_B$ is Bolgiano wavenumber. The
$k^{-5/3}$ scaling akin to passive scalar turbulence is a direct consequence of
the assumption that buoyancy is insignificant for $k>k_B$. We revisit this
assumption, and using constancy of kinetic and potential energy fluxes and
simple theoretical analysis, we find that $ k^{-5/3}$ spectrum is absent. This
is because the velocity field at small scales is too weak to establish a
constant kinetic energy flux as in passive scalar turbulence. A quantitative
condition for the existence of the second regime is also derived in the paper.

attention recently. In this scenario, user's behavior evolves from single click
behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,
most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique
criterion of judging user's preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs
have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous
graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is
still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based
behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of
behaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity. We have three main
steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and
multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain
entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called
G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn
behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity
features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of
user's interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and
diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into
account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at
their different levels of concentration degrees.

computational kirigami (paper cutting and folding) to paper wrapping. Our

reliable fabrication of conformal devices than paper folding approaches. This
in turn leads to a significant increase in the applicability of computational
kirigami to real-world fabrication. This new computer-aided design transforms
2D-based conventional materials, such as Si and copper, into a variety of
targeted conformal structures that can fully wrap the desired 3D structure

are only specified up to a partition function (i.e., constant of
proportionality). One prevalent example of this is sampling posteriors in
parametric distributions, such as latent-variable generative models. However
sampling (even very approximately) can be #P-hard.
  Classical results going back to Bakry and \'Emery (1985) on sampling focus on
log-concave distributions, and show a natural Markov chain called Langevin
diffusion mixes in polynomial time. However, all log-concave distributions are
uni-modal, while in practice it is very common for the distribution of interest
to have multiple modes. In this case, Langevin diffusion suffers from torpid
mixing.
  We address this problem by combining Langevin diffusion with simulated
tempering. The result is a Markov chain that mixes more rapidly by
transitioning between different temperatures of the distribution. We analyze
this Markov chain for a mixture of (strongly) log-concave distributions of the
same shape. In particular, our technique applies to the canonical multi-modal
distribution: a mixture of gaussians (of equal variance). Our algorithm
efficiently samples from these distributions given only access to the gradient
of the log-pdf.
  For the analysis, we introduce novel techniques for proving spectral gaps
based on decomposing the action of the generator of the diffusion. Previous
approaches rely on decomposing the state space as a partition of sets, while
our approach can be thought of as decomposing the stationary measure as a
mixture of distributions (a ""soft partition"").

is a abundant phenomenon in various systems in physics, chemistry and molecular
biophysics. We consider the narrow escape problem in a cellular flow when the
two gates randomly switch between different states with a switching rate k
between the two gates. After briefly deriving the coupled partial differential
equations for the escape time through two gates, we compute the mean escape
time for particles escaping from the gates with different initial states. By
numerical simulation under nonuniform boundary conditions, we quantify how
narrow escape time is affected by the switching rate k between the two gates,
arc length s between two gates, angular velocity w of the cellular flow and
diffusion coefficient D. We reveal that the mean escape time decreases with the
switching rate k between the two gates, angular velocity w and diffusion
coefficient D for fixed arc length, but takes the minimum when the two gates
are evenly separated on the boundary for any given switching rate k between the
two gates. In particular, we find that when the arc length size {\epsilon} for
the gates is sufficiently small, the average narrow escape time is
approximately independent of the gate arc length size. We further indicate
combinations of system parameters (regions located in the parameter space) such
that the mean escape time is the longest or shortest. Our findings provide
mathematical understanding for phenomena such as how ions select ion channels

efficiently integrate such systems. The slow components are discretized by a
Runge-Kutta method, and the fast components are resolved by solving modified
fast differential equations. Sandu (2018) developed the Multirate Infinitesimal
General-structure Additive Runge-Kutta (MRI-GARK) family of methods that
includes traditional MIS schemes as a subset. The MRI-GARK framework allowed
the construction of the first fourth order MIS schemes. This framework also
enabled the introduction of implicit methods, which are decoupled in the sense
that any implicitness lies entirely within the fast or slow integrations. It
was shown by Sandu that the stability of decoupled implicit MRI-GARK methods
has limitations when both the fast and slow components are stiff and interact
strongly. This work extends the MRI-GARK framework by introducing coupled
implicit methods to solve stiff multiscale systems. The coupled approach has
the potential to considerably improve the overall stability of the scheme, at
the price of requiring implicit stage calculations over the entire system. Two
coupling strategies are considered. The first computes coupled Runge-Kutta
stages before solving a single differential equation to refine the fast
solution. The second alternates between computing coupled Runge-Kutta stages
and solving fast differential equations. We derive order conditions and perform
the stability analysis for both strategies. The new coupled methods offer
improved stability compared to the decoupled MRI-GARK schemes. The theoretical
properties of the new methods are validated with numerical experiments.

Thus, understanding where these settlements are is of paramount importance to
both government and non-government organizations (NGOs), such as the United

effective social and economic aid. We propose two effective methods for
detecting and mapping the locations of informal settlements. One uses only
low-resolution (LR), freely available, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite

that uses only costly very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. To our

optical resonant cavities for enhancing the detector sensitivity. These
cavities store hundreds of kilowatts of coherent light and even higher optical
power for future detectors. With such high optical power, the radiation
pressure effect inside the cavity creates sufficiently strong coupling between
test masses whose dynamics are significantly altered. The dynamics of two
independent nearly free masses become a coupled mechanical resonator system.
The transfer function of the local control system used for controlling the test
masses is modified by the radiation pressure effect. The changes in the
transfer function of the local control systems can result in a new type of
angular instability which occurs at only 1.3 \% of the Sidles-Sigg instability
threshold power. We report experimental results on a 74~m suspended cavity with
a few kilowatts of circulating power, for which the power to mass ratio is
comparable to the current Advanced LIGO. The radiation pressure effect on the
test masses behaves like an additional optical feedback with respect to the
local angular control, potentially making the mirror control system unstable.
When the local angular control system is optimized for maximum stability
margin, the instability threshold power increases from 4~kW to 29~kW. The
system behavior is consistent with our simulation and the power dependent
evolution of both the cavity soft and hard mode is observed. We show that this
phenomenon is likely to significantly affect proposed gravitational wave
detectors that require very high optical power.

popular in the last decade, due to their potential to be used in various
applications of many different fields. As of today, WSNs are pretty much used
by any monitoring system: from those that are health care related, to those
that are used for environmental forecasting or surveillance purposes. All
applications that make use of insitu sensors, strongly rely on their correct
operation, which however, is quite difficult to guarantee. These sensors in
fact, are typically cheap and prone to malfunction. Additionally, for many
tasks (e.g. environmental forecasting), sensors are also deployed under
potentially harsh weather condition, making their breakage even more likely.
The high probability of erroneous readings or data corruption during
transmission, brings up the problem of ensuring quality of the data collected
by sensors. Since WSNs have to operate continuously and therefore generate very
large volumes of data every day, the quality control process has to be
automated, scalable and fast enough to be applicable to streaming data. The
most common approach to ensure the quality of sensors data, consists in
automated detection of erroneous readings or anomalous behaviours of sensors.
In the literature, this strategy is known as anomaly detection and can be
pursued in many different ways.

electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), originating from the electron orbital

more interesting (and more complicated) in the presence of the spin-orbital
interaction. In this case, a more general type of resonance may occur, which is
driven by the electric excitation mechanism and involves the spin degrees of
freedom. Such electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR) may occur at the spin
excitation frequency or at a combination of the orbital and spin frequencies,
spanning a wide bandwidth. The EDSR phenomenon, first predicted by Rashba
(1960), has been probed experimentally in 3D solids with different crystal
symmetries, as well as in low-dimensional systems (heterojunctions, inversion
layers, dislocations and impurity states). Due to its electric dipole origin,
the EDSR features a relatively high intensity, which may exceed by orders of

type. The reversible transition between the switch states is achieved by
inducing the phase transition from crystalline to amorphous and vice-versa by
application of voltage pulses. The approach of embedding the nanoscale active
material Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} within the
Si waveguide is taken to enhance the interaction of light with the active
region of the switches. The dimensions of the active regions of the switches
are optimized to achieve low insertion loss, low switching energy, and high
extinction ratio. In case of one input-one output switch, an extinction ratio
of 33.79 dB along with an extremely low insertion loss of 0.52 dB is achieved
using optimum Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} length
of only 0.92 $\mu$m. For one input-two outputs switch, an extinction ratio of
10.33 dB and 5.23 dB is obtained in cross and bar state respectively using an
active length of 52 $\mu$m. These values of extinction ratio, which are
otherwise 18.59 dB and 8.33 dB respectively, are due to the necessity of doping
the Si beneath the Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} to
facilitate the electrical conduction needed for Joule heating. A suitable gap
of 100 nm is kept between the active and passive arm of the directional coupler
switch. The electro-thermal co-simulations confirm that phase change occurs in
whole of the Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} region
in both types of switches.

possible volatility of the financial markets. Finally, the dual representation

every this new systemic risk measure can be decomposed into a convex certain

1. Such vectors lie in the standard simplex, which is a manifold with boundary.
One issue that has been rather controversial within the field of compositional
data analysis is the choice of metric on the simplex. One popular possibility
has been to use the metric implied by logtransforming the data, as proposed by
Aitchison [1, 2]; and another popular approach has been to use the standard
Euclidean metric inherited from the ambient space. Tsagris et al. [21] proposed
a one-parameter family of power transformations, the $\alpha$-transformations,
which include both the metric implied by Aitchison's transformation and the
Euclidean metric as particular cases. Our underlying philosophy is that, with
many datasets, it may make sense to use the data to help us determine a
suitable metric. A related possibility is to apply the $\alpha$-transformations
to a parametric family of distributions, and then estimate a along with the
other parameters. However, as we shall see, when one follows this last approach
with the Dirichlet family, some care is needed in a certain limiting case which
arises $(\alpha \neq 0)$, as we found out when fitting this model to real and
simulated data. Specifically, when the maximum likelihood estimator of a is
close to 0, the other parameters tend to be large. The main purpose of the
paper is to study this limiting case both theoretically and numerically and to
provide insight into these numerical findings.

allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and to avoid violating
conservation of angular momentum, vacuum fluctuations of charged
particle-antiparticle pairs appear as bound states in the lowest energy level
that has zero angular momentum. These transient atoms are polarized by electric
fields somewhat similarly to the way that ordinary matter is polarized. As a
consequence, the permittivity $\epsilon_0$ of the vacuum can be calculated.
Once the permittivity of the vacuum has been calculated, formulas for the speed

reservoir. A classical way to generate such forecasts consists in simulating
future production for numerical models representative of the reservoir.
However, identifying such models can be very challenging as they need to be
constrained to all available data. In particular, they should reproduce past
production data, which requires to solve a complex non-linear inverse problem.
In this paper, we thus propose to investigate the potential of machine learning
algorithms to predict the future production of a reservoir based on past
production data without model calibration. We focus more specifically on robust
online aggregation, a deterministic approach that provides a robust framework
to make forecasts on a regular basis. This method does not rely on any specific
assumption or need for stochastic modeling. Forecasts are first simulated for a
set of base reservoir models representing the prior uncertainty, and then
combined to predict production at the next time step. The weight associated to
each forecast is related to its past performance. Three different algorithms
are considered for weight computations: the exponentially weighted average
algorithm, ridge regression and the Lasso regression. They are applied on a
synthetic reservoir case study, the Brugge case, for sequential predictions. To
estimate the potential of development scenarios, production forecasts are
needed on long periods of time without intermediary data acquisition. An
extension of the deterministic aggregation approach is thus proposed in this
paper to provide such multi-step-ahead forecasts.

Density Polyethylene specimen were studied from full-field strain and strain

the strain localization effect becomes less pronounced when the temperature
increases. For temperatures higher than 60{\textdegree}C , the material is
found to exhibit double yielding behavior. By analyzing the DIC data in
Lagrangian representation, it was possible to quantitatively highlight the
strain localization effect that is specifically associated with the second
yield. The second yield strain (E_{Y_2}) was measured and appeared to be
independent of temperature. For temperatures smaller than 60{\textdegree}C , it
was found that the threshold strain corresponding to (E_{Y_2}) also marks the
onset of the deformation process phase during which the volume strain strongly
increases. Based on previous studies of our research team and on literature we
concluded that the critical strain (E_{Y_2}) corresponds to the onset of the
lamellar morphology destruction. At high strain levels, the neck stabilization
phase was shown to proceed according to a strain driven scheme characterized by
threshold strains that are temperature independent. The experimental values of
the threshold strain marking the onset of the stabilization phase are found to
be in good agreement with those found using the Haward-Thackray model.

stochastic generalization of resource allocation problems where future demands
are expressed in a finite number of possible scenarios. The goal is to select
cost effective resources to be acquired in the present time (first stage), and
to implement a complete solution for each scenario (second stage), while
minimizing the total expected cost of the choices in both stages.
  We propose an evolutionary framework for solving general two-stage stochastic
resource allocation problems. In each iteration of our framework, a local
search algorithm selects resources to be acquired in the first stage. A genetic
metaheuristic then completes the solutions for each scenario and relevant
information is passed onto the next iteration, thereby supporting the
acquisition of promising resources in the following first stage.
Experimentation on numerous instances of the two-stage stochastic Steiner tree
problem suggests that our evolutionary framework is powerful enough to address
large instances of a wide variety of two-stage stochastic resource allocation
problems.

the wetting of a substrate and, consequently, the quality of the printed

decomposition of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layers. A smooth transition
in the wetting occurs when the thickness of the PMMA layer approaches zero,
probably due to percolating the underlying surface of the substrate, which
enables the inkjet printing of complex structures with a high resolution. In
particular, the wetting of three substrate-ink systems was successfully
adjusted using the thin polymeric layer: (i) a tantalum-oxide-based ink on
