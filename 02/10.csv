triphenylbismuth, which is composed of one bismuth atom and three phenyl rings.
The combination of dc and ac magnetic measurements reveals that one hundred
percent of synthesized samples exhibit superconductivity at 3.5 K and/or 7.2 K
at ambient pressure. The magnetization hysteresis loops provide a strong
evidence of type-II superconductor, with the upper critical magnetic field up

indicate that superconductivity is realized by transferring electron from
potassium to carbon atom. Our study opens an encouraging window for the search

geometry and dust evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We aimed
to construct a 3-dimensional model of HD 163296 capable of reproducing
simultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the
SPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk
midplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is
intermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig
stars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the
ALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used
to constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and
grain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the
disk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only
the innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a
lack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two
models capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased
settling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the
surface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the
first ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the
outer disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and NIR
wavelengths. In the region outside the fragmentation-dominated regime, such
depletion is expected from state-of-the-art dust evolution models. We studied
the effect of creating an artificial inner cavity in our models, and conclude
that HD 163296 might be a precursor to typical group I sources.

device-to-device (D2D) communications has yet to be realized, mainly due to
severe interference and lack of enough bandwidth in the microwave ($\mu$W)
band. Recently, exploiting the millimeter wave (mmW) band for D2D
communications has attracted considerable attention as a potential solution to
these challenges. However, its severe sensitivity to blockage along with its
directional nature make the utilization of the mmW band a challenging task as
it requires line-of-sight (LOS) link detection and careful beam alignment
between the D2D transceivers. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed
mechanism which enables the D2D devices to discover unblocked LOS links for the
mmW band communication. Moreover, as such LOS links are not always available,
the proposed mechanism allows the D2D devices to switch to the $\mu$W band if
necessary. In addition, the proposed mechanism detects the direction of the LOS
links to perform the beam alignment. We have used tools from stochastic
geometry to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in terms of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is then compared to the one of the single
band (i.e., $\mu$W/mmW) communication. The simulation results show that the
proposed mechanism considerably outperforms the single band communication.

binary system Eta Carinae is such that the secondary star is closer to us at
periastron passage, and it is on the far side during most of the time of the
eccentric orbit. The binary orientation we dispute is based on problematic
interpretations of recent observations. Among these observations are the radial
velocity of the absorption component of He I P-Cyg lines, of the He II
$\lambda4686$ emission line, and of the Br$\gamma$ line emitted by clumps close
to the binary system. We also base our orientation on observations of
asymmetric molecular clumps that were recently observed by ALMA around the
binary system, and were claimed to compose a torus with a missing segment. The
orientation has implications for the modeling of the binary interaction during
the nineteenth century Great Eruption (GE) of Eta Carinae that occurred close
to periastron passage. The orientation where the secondary is closer to us at
periastron leads us to suggest that the mass-missing side of the molecular
clumps is a result of accretion onto the secondary star during the periastron
passage when the clumps were ejected, probably during the GE. The secondary
star accreted a few solar masses during the GE and the energy from the
accretion process consists the majority of the GE energy. This in turn
strengthens the more general model according to which many
intermediate-luminosity optical transients (ILOTs) are powered by accretion
onto a secondary star.

gaussian white noise fluctuating linear shear flow known as the Majda Model. We
focus on deterministic initial data and establish the symmetry properties of
the evolving point wise probability measure for the random scalar. We identify,
for both point line source initial data, regions in the x-y plane outside of
which the PDF skewness is sign definite for all time, while inside these
regions we observe multiple sign changes corresponding to exchanges in symmetry
between hot and cold leaning states using exact representation formula for the
PDF at the origin, and away from the origin, using numerical evaluation of the
exact available Mehler kernels for the scalars statistical moments. A new,
rapidly convergent Monte-Carlo method is developed, dubbed Direct Monte-Carlo
(DMC), using the random Green's functions allowing for the fast construction of
the PDF for single point statistics, and multi-point statistics natural for
full Monte-Carlo simulations of the underlying stochastic differential
equations (FMC). This new method demonstrates the full evolution of the PDF
from short times, to its long time, limiting and collapsing universal
distribution at arbitrary points in the plane. Further, this method provides a
strong benchmark for FMC and we document numbers of field realization criteria
for the FMC to faithfully compute this complete dynamics. Armed with this
benchmark, we apply the FMC to a channel with a no-flux boundary condition
enforced on a channel and observe a dramatically different long time state
resulting from the wall. In particular, the channel case collapsing invariant
measure has negative skewness, with random states heavily leaning heavily
towards the hot state, in stark contrast to free space, where the limiting
skewness is positive, with its states leaning heavily towards the cold state.

the 1970s and has been rapidly emerging in recent years. Still, real-world
applications continue to face events that are difficult to classify. The
induced imprecision needs to be handled as statistical noise and thus methods
have been defined to ensure that measurement errors do not exceed certain
bounds. Various recommendations for such an APC validation have been made to
establish criteria that limit the bias and the variability of the measurement
errors. In those works, the misinterpretation of non-significance in
statistical hypothesis tests for the detection of differences (e.g. Student's
t-test) proves to be prevalent, although existing methods which were developed
under the term equivalence testing in biostatistics (i.e. bioequivalence
trials, Schuirmann in J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 15(6):657-680, 1987) would be
appropriate instead. This heavily affects the calibration and validation
process of APC systems and has been the reason for unexpected results when the
sample sizes were not suitably chosen: Large sample sizes were assumed to
improve the assessment of systematic measurement errors of the devices from a
user's perspective as well as from a manufacturer's perspective, but the
regular t-test fails to achieve that. We introduce a variant of the t-test, the
revised t-test, which addresses both type I and type II errors appropriately
and allows a comprehensible transition from the long-established t-test in a
widely used industrial recommendation. This test is appealing, but still it is
susceptible to numerical instability. Finally, we analytically reformulate it
as a numerically stable equivalence test, which is thus easier to use. Our
results therefore allow to induce an equivalence test from a t-test and
increase the comparability of both tests, especially for decision makers.

in an $N$-dimensional lattice are initially assigned types randomly. As time
evolves, the type at a vertex $v$ has a tendency to be replaced with the most
common type within distance $w$ of $v$. We present the first mathematical
description of the dynamical scaling limit of this model as $w$ tends to

integro-differential equation for the limiting Schelling dynamics and proving
almost sure existence and uniqueness of the solutions when the initial

$\phi$) is almost surely finite, thereby extending a result of Bass and Burdzy.

main uses in the modelling of galaxies: first, they provide a compact
representation of numerically-constructed (or real) cosmological haloes,
incorporating the effects of triaxiality, lopsidedness or other distortion.
Secondly, they provide the basis functions for self-consistent field expansion
algorithms used in the evolution of $N$-body systems. We present a new family
of biorthogonal potential-density pairs constructed using the Hankel transform
of the Laguerre polynomials. The lowest-order density basis functions are
double-power-law profiles cusped like $\rho \sim r^{-2 + 1/\alpha}$ at small
radii with asymptotic density fall-off like $\rho \sim r^{-3 -1/(2\alpha)}$.
Here, $\alpha$ is a parameter satisfying $\alpha \ge 1/2$. The family therefore
spans the range of inner density cusps found in numerical simulations, but has
much shallower -- and hence more realistic -- outer slopes than the
corresponding members of the only previously-known family deduced by Zhao
(1996) and exemplified by Hernquist & Ostriker (1992). When $\alpha =1$, the
lowest-order density profile has an inner density cusp of $\rho \sim r^{-1}$
and an outer density slope of $\rho \sim r^{-3.5}$, similar to the famous
Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) model. For this reason, we demonstrate that our
new expansion provides a more accurate representation of flattened NFW haloes
than the competing Hernquist-Ostriker expansion. We utilize our new expansion

neural network, this problem will not only result in a bias toward the majority
class but show the inability to learn from the minority classes. In this paper,
we propose an end-to-end trainable Tree-Shaped Deep Neural Network (TSDNN)
which classifies the data in a layer-wise manner. To better learn from the
minority classes, we propose a Quantity Dependent Backpropagation (QDBP)
algorithm which incorporates the knowledge of the disparity between classes. We
evaluate our method on an imbalanced data set. Experimental result demonstrates
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and justifies that
the proposed method is able to overcome the difficulty of imbalanced learning.
We also conduct a partial flow experiment which shows the feasibility of
real-time detection and a zero-shot learning experiment which justifies the

couplings, taking DD-ME$\delta$ as an effective interaction, the moments of
inertia of neutron stars possessing various stellar masses are studied within
the density dependent relativistic mean field (RMF) theory. The isovector
scalar channel contributes to the softening of the neutron-star matter equation
of state (EOS) and therefore the reduction of the maximum mass and radius of
neutron stars. Smaller values of the total moment of inertia $I$ and the
crustal moment of inertia $\Delta{I}$ are then obtained in DD-ME$\delta$ via
numerical procedure in comparison with those in other selected RMF functionals.
In addition, the involvement of the isovector scalar channel lowers the
thickness of the neutron star crust and its mass fraction as well. The
sensitivity to both the crustal mass and stellar radius causes the crustal
moment of inertia to be more obviously reduced than the total one, eventually
leading to a suppression on the fraction of crustal moment of inertia
$\Delta{I}/I$ in DD-ME$\delta$. The results indicate the crustal moment of
inertia as a more sensitive probe of the neutron-star matter EOS than the total
one, and demonstrate that the isovector scalar meson-nucleon couplings in the
RMF theory could exert influence over the physics of pulsar glitches.

have revealed that, for a single-layer network, synergy can enhance spreading
and even induce an explosive contagion. There is at the present a growing
interest in behavior spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. What is the role
of synergistic interactions in behavior spreading in such networked systems? To
address this question, we articulate a synergistic behavior spreading model on
a double layer network, where the key manifestation of the synergistic
interactions is that the adoption of one behavior by a node in one layer
enhances its probability of adopting the behavior in the other layer. A general
result is that synergistic interactions can greatly enhance the spreading of
the behaviors in both layers. A remarkable phenomenon is that the interactions
can alter the nature of the phase transition associated with behavior adoption
or spreading dynamics. In particular, depending on the transmission rate of one
behavior in a network layer, synergistic interactions can lead to a
discontinuous (first-order) or a continuous (second-order) transition in the
adoption scope of the other behavior with respect to its transmission rate. A
surprising two-stage spreading process can arise: due to synergy, nodes having
adopted one behavior in one layer adopt the other behavior in the other layer
and then prompt the remaining nodes in this layer to quickly adopt the
behavior. Analytically, we develop an edge-based compartmental theory and
perform a bifurcation analysis to fully understand, in the weak synergistic
interaction regime where the dynamical correlation between the network layers
is negligible, the role of the interactions in promoting the social behavioral
spreading dynamics in the whole system.

warm ($\sim$300 K) CO reservoir is ubiquitous and that a hotter component
($760\pm170$ K) is frequently detected around protostars. The line emission is
extended beyond $\sim$1000 AU spatial scales in 40/90 objects, typically in
molecular tracers in Class 0 and atomic tracers in Class I objects.
High-velocity emission ($\gtrsim90$ km s$^{-1}$) is detected in only 10 sources
in the [O I] line, suggesting that the bulk of [O I] arises from gas that is
moving slower than typical jets. Line flux ratios show an excellent agreement
with models of $C$-shocks illuminated by UV photons for pre-shock densities of
$\sim$$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and UV fields 0.1-10 times the interstellar value. The
far-IR molecular and atomic lines are a unique diagnostic of feedback from UV
emission and shocks in envelopes of deeply embedded protostars.

be rewritten in more than one way yielding the same result. Although it is a
desirable property, confluence is often too strict in practical applications
because it also considers states that can never be reached in practice.
Additionally, sometimes states that have the same semantics in the practical
context are considered as different states due to different syntactic
representations. By introducing suitable invariants and equivalence relations
on the states, programs may have the property to be confluent modulo the
equivalence relation w.r.t. the invariant which often is desirable in practice.
  In this paper, a sufficient and necessary criterion for confluence modulo
equivalence w.r.t. an invariant for Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is
presented. It is the first approach that covers invariant-based confluence
modulo equivalence for the de facto standard semantics of CHR. There is a
trade-off between practical applicability and the simplicity of proving a
confluence property. Therefore, a better manageable subset of equivalence
relations has been identified that allows for the proposed confluence criterion
and and simplifies the confluence proofs by using well established CHR analysis
methods.

  file sizes","29 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of coded caching in the $K$-user BC, our work reveals the
surprising fact that having multiple ($L$) transmitting antennas, dramatically
ameliorates the long-standing subpacketization bottleneck of coded caching by
reducing the required subpacketization to approximately its $L$th root, thus
boosting the actual DoF by a multiplicative factor of up to $L$. In asymptotic
terms, this reveals that as long as $L$ scales with the theoretical caching
gain, then the full cumulative (multiplexing + full caching) gains are achieved
with constant subpacketization. This is the first time, in any known setting,
that unbounded caching gains appear under finite file-size constraints. The
achieved caching gains here are up to $L$ times higher than any caching gains
previously experienced in any single- or multi-antenna fully-connected setting,
thus offering a multiplicative mitigation to a subpacketization problem that
was previously known to hard-bound caching gains to small constants.
  The proposed scheme is practical and it works for all values of $K,L$ and all
cache sizes. The scheme's gains show in practice: e.g. for $K=100$, when $L=1$
the theoretical caching gain of $G=10$, under the original coded caching
algorithm, would have needed subpacketization $S_1 = \binom{K}{G}=
\binom{100}{10} > 10^{13}$, while if extra transmitting antennas were added,
the subpacketization was previously known to match or exceed $S_1$. Now for
$L=5$, our scheme offers the theoretical (unconstrained) cumulative DoF $d_L =
L+G = 5+10=15$, with subpacketization $S_L=\binom{K/L}{G/L}
=\binom{100/5}{10/5} = 190$. The work extends to the multi-server and
cache-aided IC settings, while the scheme's performance, given subpacketization
$S_L=\binom{K/L}{G/L}$, is within a factor of 2 from the optimal linear
sum-DoF.

the bulk flow (BF) and the Cosmic Mach Number (CMN). We consider two types of
systematics: those related to survey properties and those induced by observer's
location in the Universe. In the former category we model sparse sampling,
velocity errors, and survey incompleteness. In the latter, we consider Local
Group (LG) analogue observers, placed in a specific location within the Cosmic
Web, satisfying various observational criteria. We differentiate such LG
observers from Copernican ones, who are at random locations. We report strong
systematic effects on the measured BF and CMN induced by sparse sampling,
velocity errors and radial incompleteness. For BF most of these effects exceed
10\% for scales $R\leq100h^{-1}$Mpc. For CMN some of these systematics can be
catastrophically large ($>50\%$) also on bigger scales. Moreover, we find that
the position of the observer in the Cosmic Web significantly affects the
locally measured BF (CMN), with effects as large as $\sim20\%$ ($30\%)$ at
$R\leq50h^{-1}$Mpc for a LG-like observer as compared to a random one. This
effect is comparable to the sample variance. To highlight the importance of
these systematics, we additionally study a model of modified gravity (MG) with
$\sim15\%$ enhanced growth rate. We found that the systematic effects can mimic
the modified gravity signal. The worst-case scenario is realized for a case of
a LG-like observer, when the effects induced by local structures are degenerate
with the enhanced growth rate fostered by MG. Our results indicate that
dedicated constrained simulations and realistic mock galaxy catalogs will be
absolutely necessary to fully benefit from the statistical power of the
forthcoming peculiar velocity data from surveys such as TAIPAN, WALLABY, Cosmic
Flows-4 and SKA.

high-precision tools are provided for the computation of the relic density in

protohalos. Furthermore, the code allows to calculate dark matter
self-interaction rates, which may affect the distribution of dark matter at
small cosmological scales. Compared to earlier versions, DarkSUSY 6 introduces
many significant physics improvements and extensions. The most fundamental new
feature of this release, however, is that the code has been completely
re-organized and brought into a highly modular and flexible shape. Switching
between different pre-implemented dark matter candidates has thus become

referring to comoving distances, which take into account the cosmological

known to relax to values described by periodic infinite temperature ensembles.
At the same time, ergodic static systems exhibit anomalous thermalization of
local observables and satisfy a modified version of the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH), when disorder is present. This raises the
question, how does the introduction of disorder affect relaxation in
periodically driven systems? In this work, we analyze this problem by
numerically studying transport and thermalization in an archetypal example. We
find that thermalization is anomalous and is accompanied by subdiffusive
transport with a disorder dependent dynamical exponent. Distributions of matrix
elements of local operators in the eigenbases of a family of effective
time-independent Hamiltonians, which describe the stroboscopic dynamics of such
systems, show anomalous departures from predictions of ETH signaling that only
a modified version of ETH is satisfied. The dynamical exponent is shown to be
related to the scaling of the variance of these distributions with system size.

$M=2.4_{-0.2}^{+0.4}$. The shock becomes oblique away from the merger axis,
with the Mach number falling to $\simeq$1.6 around 30$^{\circ}$ from the nose.
The electron temperature immediately behind the shock nose is consistent with
that from the Rankine-Hugoniot adiabat, and is higher (at a 95% confidence)
than expected for adiabatic compression of electrons followed by Coulomb
electron-proton equilibration, indicating the presence of equilibration
mechanisms faster than Coulomb collisions. This is similar to an earlier
finding for the Bullet cluster. We also combined four archival VLA datasets to
obtain a better image of the cluster's giant radio halo at 1.4 GHz. An abrupt
edge of the radio halo traces the shock front, and no emission is detected in
the pre-shock region. If the radio edge were due only to adiabatic compression
of relativistic electrons in pre-shock plasma, we would expect a pre-shock
radio emission detectable in this radio dataset; however, an interferometric
artifact dominates the uncertainty, so we cannot rule this model out. Other
interesting features of the radio halo include a peak at the remnant of the
cool core, suggesting that the core used to have a radio minihalo, and a peak
marking a possible region of high turbulence.

are defined. By constructing the local tetrad bases at the observer and the

additional relativistic effects contribute to all the lensing observables. We
explicitly verify the gauge-invariance of the lensing observables and compare
our results to previous work. In particular, we demonstrate that even in the
presence of the vector and tensor perturbations, the physical rotation of the
lensing observables vanishes at the linear order, while the tetrad basis
rotates along the light propagation compared to a FRW coordinate. Though the
latter is often used as a probe of primordial gravitational waves, the rotation
of the tetrad basis is indeed not a physical observable. We further clarify its
relation to the E-B decomposition in weak lensing. Our formalism provides a

involving (derivatives of) delta distributions---have become increasingly
ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and applied mathematics. It is often of
considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but any
singular (""particle""-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial
computational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some
form of delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid;
however, this often carries significant limitations on the efficiency of the
numerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the problem
at all.
  In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such
equations which avoids the singular behavior entirely: the
""Particle-without-Particle"" method. Previously introduced in the context of the
self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize the
computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral
(Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids such that the ""particle"" is always at the interface
between them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous equations in each
domain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions
thereon. We prove here that this method yields solutions to any linear PDE the
source of which is any linear combination of delta distributions and
derivatives thereof supported on a one-dimensional subspace of the problem
domain. We then implement it to numerically solve a variety of relevant PDEs:
hyperbolic (with applications to neuroscience and acoustics), parabolic (with
applications to finance), and elliptic. We generically obtain improved
convergence rates relative to typical past implementations relying on delta
function approximations.

a light curve for SS 433 determined from shorter monitoring runs. The complex
morphology of W 50 is in excellent agreement with previously published
higher-frequency maps; we find additional evidence for a spectral turnover in
the eastern wing, potentially due to foreground free-free absorption.
Furthermore, SS 433 is tentatively variable at 150 MHz, with both a debiased
modulation index of 11 per cent and a $\chi^2$ probability of a flat light
curve of $8.2 \times 10^{-3}$. By comparing the LOFAR flux densities with

approximately six months at 4800 MHz. However, the increase is too large to be
explained with a standard synchrotron bubble model. We also detect a wealth of

a difficult puzzle for modern astrophysics. A major hurdle in the search for
the sources is the fact that UHECRs are deflected by the Galactic magnetic
field (GMF). Current knowledge of the GMF is limited, as most experimental
measurements track line-of-sight--integrated quantities that are used to obtain
best-fit parameters for global models including a large random component. The
advent, however, of the Gaia era, with measurements of $\sim 10^9$ stellar
parallaxes, in combination with upcoming large polarimetric surveys, make, for
the first time, a 3D measurement of the GMF possible in principle. Such
measurements can then be used to attempt a reconstruction of the trajectories
of individual UHECRs through the Galaxy, in order to correct for their
deflection.
  Motivated by these developments, in the present work, we study the limits of
such a correction, by examining how its effectiveness depends on the
uncertainty of any such future magnetic field measurements. To that end, we
simulate attempts to reconstruct the trajectory of the cosmic ray by using
hypothetical measurements of the GMF, based on values received from two
recently updated GMF models. To simulate the uncertainty of a 3D measurement,
random errors to these values are introduced separately for the
plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnitude, the line-of-sight (LOS) magnitude and the POS
direction.
  Our results highlight the conditions under which an effective correction is
achievable. We find that the effectiveness is dependent on the particle
rigidity and arrival direction, and can vary significantly depending on the GMF
model used.

of natural electroweak supersymmetry seem to lie either in compressed spectra
or in spectra where scalars are suppressed with respect to the gauginos. While
in the MSSM (or in any theory where supersymmetry is broken by the $F$-vev of a
chiral spurion), a hierarchy between scalar and gaugino masses requires special
constructions, it is automatic in scenarios where supersymmetry is broken by
$D$-vev of a real spurion. In the latter framework, gaugino mediated
contributions to scalar soft masses are finite (loop suppressed but not
$\log$-enhanced), a feature often referred to as ""supersoftness"". Though
phenomenologically attractive, pure supersoft models suffer from the
$\mu$-problem, potential color-breaking minima, large $T$-parameter, etc. These
problems can be overcome without sacrificing the model's virtues by departing
from pure supersoftness and including $\mu$-type operators that use the same
$D$-vev, a framework known as generalized supersoft supersymmetry. The main
purpose of this paper is to point out that the new operators also solve the
last remaining issue associated with supersoft spectra, namely that a right
handed (RH) slepton is predicted to be the lightest superpartner, rendering the
setup cosmologically unfeasible. In particular, we show that the
$\mu$-operators in generalized supersoft generate a new source for scalar
masses, which can raise the RH-slepton mass above bino due to corrections from
renormalisation group evolutions (RGEs). In fact, a mild tuning can open up the
bino--RH slepton coannihilation regime for a thermal dark matter. We derive the
full set of RGEs required to determine the spectrum at low energies. Beginning
with input conditions at a high scale, we show that completely viable spectra
can be achieved.

anisotropy (the amount of motion in the radial direction compared to the
tangential one) is mildly radial with 0.2<beta<0.4. However, for stars with

of 20<v_theta (km/s) <30. Using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of
halo formation, we deduce that the observed acute anisotropy is inconsistent
with the continuous accretion of dwarf satellites. Instead, we argue, the
stellar debris in the inner halo were deposited in a major accretion event by a
satellite with Mvir>10^10 Msun around the epoch of the Galactic disc formation,

Sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning
framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular
simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep
learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution
along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the
molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction
coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum,
yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum
probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for
a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module
with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing
until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike
recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands
out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction
coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to
enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning,
and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned
by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is
demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity,
including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic
ligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than
three minutes, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for
umbrella sampling or metadynamics.

VLT/SINFONI) and UV (SDSS) spectra of 18 randomly selected WISSH QSOs to
measure the SMBH mass and study the properties of winds both in the NLR and BLR
traced by blueshifted/skewed [OIII] and CIV emission lines, respectively. These
WISSH QSOs are powered by SMBH with masses $\ge$10$^9$ Msun accreting at
0.4<$\lambda_{Edd}$<3.1. We have found the existence of two sub-populations
characterized by the presence of outflows at different distances from the SMBH.
One population ([OIII] sources) exhibits powerful [OIII] outflows, rest-frame
EW (REW) of the CIV emission REW$_{CIV}\approx$20-40 A and modest CIV velocity
shift (v$_{CIV}^{peak}$) with respect to the systemic redshift (<=2000 km/s).
The second population (Weak [OIII] sources), representing ~70% of the analyzed
WISSH QSOs, shows weak/absent [OIII] emission and an extremely large
v$_{CIV}^{peak}$ (up to ~8000 km/s and REW$_{CIV}$<=20 A). We propose two
explanations for the observed behavior of the strength of the [OIII] emission
in terms of orientation effects of the line of sight and ionization cone. The
dichotomy in the presence of BLR and NLR winds could be likely due to
inclination effects considering a polar geometry scenario for the BLR winds. We
find a strong correlation with L$_{Bol}$ and an anti-correlation with
$\alpha_{ox}$, whereby the higher L$_{Bol}$, the steeper $\alpha_{ox}$ and the
larger is the v$_{CIV}^{peak}$. Finally, the observed dependence
v$_{CIV}^{peak}\propto L_{Bol}^{0.28\pm0.04}$ is consistent with radiatively
driven winds scenario, where strong UV continuum is necessary to launch the
wind and a weakness of the X-ray emission is fundamental to prevent
overionization of the wind itself.

found to take on high values in the entire doping and temperature region.
Finally, the characteristic dimensionless ratios for the superconducting band

distribution of all the other players, and this introduces mean-field terms in
the running and the terminal cost. The first contribution involves a mean-field
game model that brings together macroscopic and microscopic dynamics. We obtain
the mean-field equilibrium associated with this model, by solving the
corresponding initial-terminal value problem. We perform an asymptotic analysis
to obtain a stationary equilibrium for the system. The second contribution
involves the study of the microscopic dynamics of the system for a finite
number of players that interact in a structured environment modeled by an
interaction topology. The third contribution is the specialization of the model
to describe honeybee swarms, virus propagation, and cascading failures in
interconnected smart-grids. A numerical analysis is conducted which involves
two types of cyber-attacks. We simulate in which ways failures propagate across
the interconnected smart grids and the impact on the grids frequencies. We
reframe our analysis within the context of Lyapunov's linearisation method and
stability theory of nonlinear systems and Kuramoto coupled oscillators model.

as a promising solution to the challenge of high DER penetration, but there is
a lack of a distributed computation method that universally and effectively
works for the TDCEM. To bridge this gap, a generalized mas-ter-slave-splitting
(G-MSS) method is presented in this paper. This method is based on a
general-purpose transmis-sion-distribution coordination model called G-TDCM,
which thus enables the G-MSS to be applicable to most of the central functions
of the TDCEM. In this G-MSS method, a basic heter-ogenous decomposition (HGD)
algorithm is first derived from the HGD of the coupling constraints in the
optimality conditions of the G-TDCM. Its optimality and convergence properties
are then proved. Further, inspired by the conditions for conver-gence, a
modified HGD algorithm that utilizes the subsystem's response function is
developed and thus converges faster. The distributed G-MSS method is then
demonstrated to successfully solve a series of central functions, e.g. power
flow, contingency analysis, voltage stability assessment, economic dispatch and
optimal power flow, of the TDCEM. The severe issues of over-voltage and
erroneous assessment of the system security that are caused by DERs are thus
resolved by the G-MSS method with modest computation cost.

the different paths that go across the device, yielding Fano resonances in the
spin dependent transport properties. Correlation effects are taken into account
at the central dot and handled within a mean field approximation. Its interplay
with the Fano effect is analyzed in the strong coupling regime. Non-vanishing
spin currents are only obtained when the leads are ferromagnetic, the current
being strongly dependent on the relative orientation of the lead polarizations.
We calculate the conductance (spin and charge) by numerically differentiating
the current, and a rich structure is obtained as a manifestation of quantum
coherence and correlation effects. Increase of the Coulomb interaction produces
localization of states at the side dot, largely suppressing Fano resonances.
The interaction is also responsible for the negative values of the spin
conductance in some regions of the voltage near resonances, effect which is the
spin analog of the Esaki tunnel diode. We also analyze control of the currents
via gate voltages applied to the dots, possibility which is interesting for
practical operations.

burst offer the best means of identifying and constraining the rate and
properties of stellar CMEs. CME properties can be further improved through the
use of proposed solar-stellar scaling relations and multi-wavelength
observations of CMEs through the use of type II bursts and the associated flare
expected to occur occur alongside. We report on 20 hours of observation of the
nearby, magnetically active, and well characterized M dwarf star EQ Peg. The
observations are simultaneously observed with the Jansky Very Large Array at
their P-band (230-470 MHz) and at the Apache Point observatory in the SDSS u'
filter ($\lambda$ = 3557 \AA). Dynamic spectra of the P band data, constructed
to search for signals in the frequency-time domains, did not reveal evidence
for drifting radio bursts that could be ascribed to type II bursts. Given the
sensitivity of our observations, we are able to place limits on the brightness
temperature and source size of any bursts which may have occurred. Using solar
scaling rations on four observed stellar flares, we predict CME parameters.
Given the constraints on coronal density and photospheric field strength, our
models suggest that the observed flares would have been insufficient to produce
detectable type II bursts at our observed frequencies. We consider the
implications of these results, and other recent findings, on stellar mass loss.

limits. Among turnoff stars outside the Li-dip, A(Li) = 3.04 +/- 0.16 (s.d.),
with no trend with color, luminosity, or rotation speed. Evolving from the
turnoff across the subgiant branch, there is a well-delineated decline to A(Li)
~1.25 at the giant branch base, coupled with the rotational spindown from
between ~20 and 70 km/s to less than 20 km/s for stars entering the subgiant
branch and beyond. A(Li) remains effectively constant from the giant branch
base to the red giant clump level. A new member above the clump redefines the
path of the first-ascent red giant branch; its Li is 0.6 dex below the
first-ascent red giants. With one exception, all post-He-flash stars have upper
limits to A(Li), at or below the level of the brightest first-ascent red giant.
The patterns are in excellent qualitative agreement with the model predictions
for low/intermediate-mass stars which undergo rotation-induced mixing at the
turnoff and subgiant branch, first dredge-up, and thermohaline mixing beyond
the red giant bump.

efficiency and ensures reproducibility. To this end, MACI incorporates and

solution to speed up the high dimensional signals sensing and reduce the

to deal with the uncertainty, improve the signal acquisition performance, and
reduce the randomness during the sensing and reconstruction processes,
compressive sensing requires a robust sampling matrix and an efficient

the advantages of a Circulant matrix with Bayesian models. This approach is
implemented, extensively tested, and its results have been compared to those of
l1 norm minimization with a Circulant or random matrix based on several

become increasingly connected and mission-critical, which in turn has attracted
advanced attacks (e.g., control-flow hijacks and data-only attacks).
Unfortunately, IoT backends are unable to detect if such attacks have happened
while receiving data, service requests, or operation status from IoT devices.
As a result, currently, IoT backends are forced to blindly trust the IoT
devices that they interact with.
  To fill this void, we first formulate a new security property for embedded
devices, called ""Operation Execution Integrity"" or OEI. We then design and
build a system, OAT, that enables remote OEI attestation for ARM-based
bare-metal embedded devices. Our formulation of OEI captures the integrity of
both control flow and critical data involved in an operation execution.
Therefore, satisfying OEI entails that an operation execution is free of
unexpected control and data manipulations, which existing attestation methods
cannot check. Our design of OAT strikes a balance between prover's constraints
(embedded devices' limited computing power and storage) and verifier's
requirements(complete verifiability and forensic assistance). OAT uses a new
control-flow measurement scheme, which enables light-weight and space-efficient
collection of measurements (97% space reduction from the trace-based approach).
OAT performs the remote control-flow verification through abstract execution,
which is fast and deterministic. OAT also features lightweight integrity
checking for critical data (74% fewer instrumentation needed than previous
work). Our security analysis shows that OAT allows remote verifiers or IoT
backends to detect both control-flow hijacks and data-only attacks that affect
the execution of operations on IoT devices. In our evaluation using real
embedded programs, OAT incurs a runtime overhead of 2.7%.

occur in 2-$d$, and 4 distinct ones in 3-$d$; these reflect counts of
non-equivalent subgroup actions of $S_3 \times C_2$ and $S_3$ respectively. The
$S_3$ acts on particle labels; the extra $C_2$ corresponds to the purely 2-$d$
option of whether or not to identify mirror images. The non-equivalent
realization is due to a suite of subgroup, orbit space and stratification
features.
  Our 2-$d$ monopoles include 4 known ones: a realization of Dirac's monopole
in relational space rather than its more habitual setting of space, the 2-$d$
version of Iwai's monopole, and indistinguishable particle monopoles with and
without mirror image identification. The 4 new ones are indistinguishable under
a 2-particle label switch or under even permutations, in each case with
optional mirror image identification. Our 4 3-$d$ monopoles are 2 known ones:
the actual Iwai monopole and its already-announced indistinguishable-particles
counterpart, and 2 new ones: the two-particle label switch and even permutation
cases. All 4 3-$d$ cases are stratified. The three even-permutation cases are
orbifolds, two with boundary, the 3-$d$ case's boundary constituting a separate
stratum, giving a stratified orbifold. We document each of the 12 cases'

heated to desorb the intercalates. Here, carbon vacancy defects are
intentionally formed on Gr/Ru(0001) and their effect on the intercalation of

sputtering with a low fluence is used to create isolated single vacancy defects

profile of PSR B2217+47, manifested as additional components trailing the main
peak. These transient components are detected over 6 years at $150$ MHz using
the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), but they are not seen in contemporaneous
Lovell observations at $1.5$ GHz. We argue that propagation effects in the
ionized interstellar medium (IISM) are the most likely cause. The putative
structures in the IISM causing the profile variation are roughly half-way
between the pulsar and the Earth and have transverse radii $R \sim 30$ AU. We
consider different models for the structures. Under the assumption of spherical
symmetry, their implied average electron density is $\overline{n}_e \sim 100$
cm$^{-3}$. Since PSR B2217+47 is more than an order of magnitude brighter than
the average pulsar population visible to LOFAR, similar profile variations
would not have been identified in most pulsars, suggesting that subtle profile
variations in low-frequency profiles might be more common than we have observed
to date. Systematic studies of these variations at low frequencies can provide
a new tool to investigate the proprieties of the IISM and the limits to the

LEDs emit considerably more short-wavelength light into the environment than
earlier technologies on a per-lumen basis. Radiative transfer models predict
increased skyglow over cities transitioning to LED unless the total lumen
output of new lighting systems is reduced. The City of Tucson, Arizona (U.S.),
recently converted its municipal street lighting system from a mixture of fully
shielded high- and low-pressure sodium (HPS/LPS) luminaires to fully shielded
3000 K white LED luminaires. The lighting design intended to minimize increases
to skyglow in order to protect the sites of nearby astronomical observatories
without compromising public safety. This involved the migration of over 445
million fully shielded HPS/LPS lumens to roughly 142 million fully shielded
3000 K white LED lumens and an expected concomitant reduction in the amount of
visual skyglow over Tucson. SkyGlow Simulator models predict skyglow decreases
on the order of 10-20% depending on whether fully shielded or partly shielded
lights are in use. We tested this prediction using visual night sky brightness
estimates and luminance-calibrated, panchromatic all-sky imagery at 15
locations in and near the city. Data were obtained in 2014, before the LED
conversion began, and in mid-2017 after approximately 95% of $\sim$18,000
luminaires was converted. Skyglow differed marginally, and in all cases with
valid data changed by $<{\pm}$20%. Over the same period, the city's
upward-directed optical radiance detected from Earth orbit decreased by
approximately 7%. While these results are not conclusive, they suggest that LED
conversions paired with dimming can reduce skyglow over cities.

  Nearest Neighbor Classification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The continuation method is a popular approach in non-convex optimization and
computer vision. The main idea is to start from a simple function that can be
minimized efficiently, and gradually transform it to the more complicated
original objective function. The solution of the simpler problem is used as the
starting point to solve the original problem. We show a continuation method for
discrete optimization problems. Ideally, we would like the evolved function to
be hill-climbing friendly and to have the same global minima as the original
function. We show that the proposed continuation method is the best affine
approximation of a transformation that is guaranteed to transform the function
to a hill-climbing friendly function and to have the same global minima.
  We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in the problem of nearest
neighbor classification. Although nearest neighbor methods are often
competitive in terms of sample efficiency, the computational complexity in the
test phase has been a major obstacle in their applicability in big data
problems. Using the proposed continuation method, we show an improved
graph-based nearest neighbor algorithm. The method is readily understood and
easy to implement. We show how the computational complexity of the method in
the test phase scales gracefully with the size of the training set, a property
that is particularly important in big data applications.

tool for investigating complex multivariate data. Correspondingly, it has found
many diverse applications, ranging from molecular biology and medicine to
social science and finance. Intriguingly, despite the importance and
pervasiveness of CCA, only recently a probabilistic understanding of CCA is
developing, moving from an algorithmic to a model-based perspective and
enabling its application to large-scale settings.
  Results: Here, we revisit CCA from the perspective of statistical whitening
of random variables and propose a simple yet flexible probabilistic model for
CCA in the form of a two-layer latent variable generative model. The advantages
of this variant of probabilistic CCA include non-ambiguity of the latent
variables, provisions for negative canonical correlations, possibility of
non-normal generative variables, as well as ease of interpretation on all
levels of the model. In addition, we show that it lends itself to
computationally efficient estimation in high-dimensional settings using
regularized inference. We test our approach to CCA analysis in simulations and
apply it to two omics data sets illustrating the integration of gene expression
data, lipid concentrations and methylation levels.
  Conclusions: Our whitening approach to CCA provides a unifying perspective on
CCA, linking together sphering procedures, multivariate regression and
corresponding probabilistic generative models. Furthermore, we offer an
efficient computer implementation in the ""whitening"" R package available at

Following an alternative formulation proposed by S. Banerjee and S. Galtier
(Phys. Rev. E,93, 033120, 2016) and S. Banerjee and S. Galtier (J. Phys. A,
Math. and Theor.,50, 015501, 2017), an exact relation has been derived for the
total energy transfer. This approach results in a simpler relation expressed
entirely in terms of mixed second-order structure functions. The kinetic,
thermodynamic, magnetic and gravitational contributions to the energy transfer
rate can be easily separated in the present form. By construction, the new
formalism includes such additional effects as global rotation, the Hall term in
the induction equation, etc. The analysis shows that solid-body rotation cannot
alter the energy flux rate of compressible turbulence. However, the
contribution of a uniform background magnetic field to the flux is shown to be
non-trivial unlike in the incompressible case. Finally, the compressible,
turbulent energy flux rate does not vanish completely due to simple alignments,
which leads to a zero turbulent energy flux rate in the incompressible case.

proposed that human locomotion may be planned in the task-space by taking
advantage of the gravitational pull acting on the Centre of Mass (CoM) that we
have used to formulate a task-space planner for straight locomotion at a
constant speed. The proposed model represents the CoM transversal trajectory as
simple harmonic oscillator moving forward at a constant speed. On the other
hand, the vertical trajectory of the CoM is controlled through the ankle
strategies. Our solution is composed of closed-form equations which can plan
human-like trajectories for both the CoM and the foot swing. The model output
can be seen as the optimal trajectory determined based on the average behaviour
of 12 healthy subjects walking at three self-selected speeds. Furthermore, the
planner formulation is compatible with an extended formulation of the Passive
Motion Paradigm which enables us to design a hierarchical architecture of
semi-autonomous controllers. The final architecture can also describe the motor
primitives as a particular case of dynamic primitives, shows strong parallels

in which the entropy term is a special form of the Tsallis entropy. The optimal
policy of this formulation is sparse, i.e.,~at each state, it has non-zero
probability for only a small number of actions. This addresses the main
drawback of the standard Shannon entropy-regularized RL (soft ERL) formulation,
in which the optimal policy is softmax, and thus, may assign a non-negligible
probability mass to non-optimal actions. This problem is aggravated as the
number of actions is increased. In this paper, we follow the work of Nachum et
al. (2017) in the soft ERL setting, and propose a class of novel path
consistency learning (PCL) algorithms, called {\em sparse PCL}, for the sparse
ERL problem that can work with both on-policy and off-policy data. We first
derive a {\em sparse consistency} equation that specifies a relationship
between the optimal value function and policy of the sparse ERL along any
system trajectory. Crucially, a weak form of the converse is also true, and we
quantify the sub-optimality of a policy which satisfies sparse consistency, and
show that as we increase the number of actions, this sub-optimality is better
than that of the soft ERL optimal policy. We then use this result to derive the
sparse PCL algorithms. We empirically compare sparse PCL with its soft
counterpart, and show its advantage, especially in problems with a large number
of actions.

cosmological constant or the dark energy. However, the origin of the dark
energy remains a mystery of modern physics. The local Lorentz invariance is the
most exact symmetry of the Nature on the one hand, but all quantum gravity
theories predict Lorentz violation on the other hand. The local Lorentz
violation induced by the quantum gravity at the very early universe may be
transformed into large scale by inflation. Combining the low-$l$ anomalies of
the CMB spectrum, we propose that the local Lorentz invariance may be broken at
the large scale. We construct the effective gravity at the cosmic scale with a
local $SO(3)$ symmetry. The theory exhibits non-trivial contortion distribution
even with scalar matter source. The FRW like solution of the theory is analyzed
and the contortion distribution contributes a dark energy like effect which is
responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. It reveals that the
dark energy may be the remnants of quantum gravity in this sense.

opportunity to study the spatialtemporal correlations. Statistical analytics
for those massive datasets start with high-dimensional data matrices.
Uncertainty is ubiquitous in a future's power grid. These data matrices are
recognized as random matrices. This new point of view is fundamental in our
theoretical analysis since true covariance matrices cannot be estimated
accurately in a high-dimensional regime. As an alternative, we consider
large-dimensional sample covariance matrices in the asymptotic regime to
replace the true covariance matrices. The self-adjoint polynomials of
large-dimensional random matrices are studied as statistics for big data
analytics. The calculation of the asymptotic spectrum distribution (ASD) for
such a matrix polynomial is understandably challenging. This task is made
possible by a recent breakthrough in free probability, an active research
branch in random matrix theory. This is the very reason why the work of this
paper is inspired initially. The new approach is interesting in many aspects.
The mathematical reason may be most critical. The real-world problems can be
solved using this approach, however.

accelerated inexact proximal point method for solving linearly constrained

the form $f + h$ where $f$ is a differentiable function whose gradient is
Lipschitz continuous and $h$ is a closed convex function with bounded domain.
The method, basically, consists of applying an accelerated inexact proximal
point method for solving approximately a sequence of quadratic penalized
subproblems associated to the linearly constrained problem. Each subproblem of
the proximal point method is in turn approximately solved by an accelerated
composite gradient (ACG) method. It is shown that the proposed scheme generates
a $\rho$-approximate stationary point in at most ${\cal{O}}(\rho^{-3})$ ACG

for data analysis in statistics, and further study and inference then often
proceed as though the selected model were the true model that were known a
priori. This practice does not account for the uncertainty introduced by the
selection process and the fact that the selected model can possibly be a wrong
one. Model averaging approaches try to remedy this issue by combining
estimators for a set of candidate models. Specifically, instead of deciding
which model is the 'right' one, a model averaging approach suggests to fit a
set of candidate models and average over the estimators using certain data
adaptive weights. In this paper we establish a general frequentist model
averaging framework that does not set any restrictions on the set of candidate
models. It greatly broadens the scope of the existing methodologies under the
frequentist model averaging development. Assuming the data is from an unknown
model, we derive the model averaging estimator and study its limiting
distributions and related predictions while taking possible modeling biases
into account. We propose a set of optimal weights to combine the individual
estimators so that the expected mean squared error of the average estimator is
minimized. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the performance of the
estimator with that of the existing methods. The results show the benefits of
the proposed approach over traditional model selection approaches as well as
existing model averaging methods.

the given data. In this paper, we propose a quantifiable measure of robustness,
and describe a particular learning method that is robust according to this

We further show that heterogeneity in communication resulted from network or

exponential effect makes the emergence of collective observation an easy
outcome in an evolutionary process. Furthermore, we are able to quantify

occluding objects, which obstruct probe-light propagation in the hidden scene,

result, we showed that two types of mobility edges appear near the Fermi energy

from Coulomb interactions while the high-energy one is nothing but the mobility
edge of the Anderson localization transition without electron correlations.
Indeed, not only multifractal scaling exponents but also the multifractal
singularity spectrum confirms the existence of two kinds of mobility edges:
Their values differ from those of the Anderson metal-insulator transition and
the singularity spectrum collapses into two types of curves, implying two kinds
of scale-invariance, which depends on the energy scale. We speculate that this
novel nature of the eigenfunction multifractality would serve as valuable

trains artificial neural networks to find non-linear functionals of data that
maximise Fisher information: information maximising neural networks (IMNNs). In
test cases where the posterior can be derived exactly, likelihood-free
inference based on automatically derived IMNN summaries produces nearly exact
posteriors, showing that these summaries are good approximations to sufficient
statistics. In a series of numerical examples of increasing complexity and
astrophysical relevance we show that IMNNs are robustly capable of
automatically finding optimal, non-linear summaries of the data even in cases
where linear compression fails: inferring the variance of Gaussian signal in
the presence of noise; inferring cosmological parameters from mock simulations
of the Lyman-{\alpha} forest in quasar spectra; and inferring frequency-domain
parameters from LISA-like detections of gravitational waveforms. In this final
case, the IMNN summary outperforms linear data compression by avoiding the
introduction of spurious likelihood maxima. We anticipate that the automatic

Two classes of crossing sea states are analysed: one using directional spectra
from the Draupner wave crossing at different angles, another considering a
Draupner-like spectra crossed with a narrowband JONSWAP state to model spectral
growth between wind sea and swell. These two classes of crossing sea states are
constructed using the spectral output of a WAVEWATCH III hindcast on the

individuals are either connected or not. While sometimes external information
can be used to infer the strength of social ties, access to such information
may be restricted or impractical. Sintos and Tsaparas (KDD 2014) first
suggested to infer the strength of social ties from the topology of the network
alone, by leveraging the Strong Triadic Closure (STC) property. The STC
property states that if person A has strong social ties with persons B and C, B
and C must be connected to each other as well (whether with a weak or strong
tie). Sintos and Tsaparas exploited this to formulate the inference of the
strength of social ties as NP-hard optimization problem, and proposed two
approximation algorithms. We refine and improve upon this landmark paper, by
developing a sequence of linear relaxations of this problem that can be solved
exactly in polynomial time. Usefully, these relaxations infer more fine-grained
levels of tie strength (beyond strong and weak), which also allows to avoid
making arbitrary strong/weak strength assignments when the network topology
provides inconclusive evidence. One of the relaxations simultaneously infers
the presence of a limited number of STC violations. An extensive theoretical
analysis leads to two efficient algorithmic approaches. Finally, our
experimental results elucidate the strengths of the proposed approach, and
sheds new light on the validity of the STC property in practice.

Due to the complicate, nonlinear, non-convex nature of neural networks, formal
safety guarantees for the behaviors of neural network systems will be crucial
for their applications in safety-critical systems. In this paper, the reachable
set estimation and verification problems for Nonlinear Autoregressive-Moving
Average (NARMA) models in the forms of neural networks are addressed. The
neural network involved in the model is a class of feed-forward neural networks
called Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). By partitioning the input set of an MLP
into a finite number of cells, a layer-by-layer computation algorithm is
developed for reachable set estimation for each individual cell. The union of
estimated reachable sets of all cells forms an over-approximation of reachable
set of the MLP. Furthermore, an iterative reachable set estimation algorithm
based on reachable set estimation for MLPs is developed for NARMA models. The
safety verification can be performed by checking the existence of intersections
of unsafe regions and estimated reachable set. Several numerical examples are
provided to illustrate our approach.

This problem is first formulated and analyzed within the dynamic programming
framework, where a general approach combining parametric rollout policy and
stochastic optimization is proposed. A discrete-choice-based price optimization
model is then used for the request level optimal decision problem and leads to
a practical and computationally tractable algorithm for the problem.
  Our algorithm is evaluated with a simulated experiment in the urban traffic

leads to higher congestion level and lower service capacity in the urban

Furthermore, there is a trend to use elastic container platforms like
Kubernetes, Docker Swarm or Apache Mesos. However, especially multi-cloud use

They can select the weapons, the point of time and the point of attack. Very
often cloud application security engineering efforts focus to harden the
fortress walls but seldom assume that attacks may be successful. So, cloud
applications rely on their defensive walls but seldom attack intruders
actively. Biological systems are different. They accept that defensive ""walls""
can be breached at several layers and therefore make use of an active and
adaptive defense system to attack potential intruders - an immune system. This
position paper proposes such an immune system inspired approach to ensure that
even undetected intruders can be purged out of cloud applications. This makes
it much harder for intruders to maintain a presence on victim systems.

statistical analysis with complicated geometric structured data such as shapes,
linked twist maps, and material data. Among them, \textit{persistent homology}
is a well-known tool to extract robust topological features, and outputs as
\textit{persistence diagrams} (PDs). However, PDs are point multi-sets which
can not be used in machine learning algorithms for vector data. To deal with
it, an emerged approach is to use kernel methods, and an appropriate geometry
for PDs is an important factor to measure the similarity of PDs. A popular
geometry for PDs is the \textit{Wasserstein metric}. However, Wasserstein
distance is not \textit{negative definite}. Thus, it is limited to build
positive definite kernels upon the Wasserstein distance \textit{without
approximation}. In this work, we rely upon the alternative \textit{Fisher
information geometry} to propose a positive definite kernel for PDs
\textit{without approximation}, namely the Persistence Fisher (PF) kernel.
Then, we analyze eigensystem of the integral operator induced by the proposed
kernel for kernel machines. Based on that, we derive generalization error
bounds via covering numbers and Rademacher averages for kernel machines with
the PF kernel. Additionally, we show some nice properties such as stability and
infinite divisibility for the proposed kernel. Furthermore, we also propose a
linear time complexity over the number of points in PDs for an approximation of
our proposed kernel with a bounded error. Throughout experiments with many
different tasks on various benchmark datasets, we illustrate that the PF kernel
compares favorably with other baseline kernels for PDs.

unsteady air which contains it. Flying organisms deal with these difficulties
using active and passive control mechanisms to steer their body motion. Body
attitudes of flapping organisms are linked with their resultant flight
trajectories and performance, yet little is understood about how discrete
unsteady aerodynamic phenomena affect the interlaced dynamics of such systems.
In this study, we examined freely flying bumblebees subject to a single
discrete gust to emulate aerodynamic disturbances encountered in nature.
Bumblebees are expert commanders of the aerial domain as they persistently
forage within complex terrain elements. Physical obstacles such as flowers
produce local effects representative of a typified gust which threatens the
precise control of intricate maneuvers. By tracking the 3D dynamics of bees
flying through gusts, we determined the sequences of motion that permit flight
in three disturbance conditions. Bees repetitively executed a series of passive
impulsive maneuvers followed by active recovery maneuvers. Impulsive motion was
unique in each gust direction, maintaining control purely by passive
manipulation of the body. Bees pitched up and slowed-down at the beginning of
recovery in every disturbance, followed by corrective maneuvers which brought
attitudes back to their original state. Bees were displaced the most by the
sideward gust, displaying large lateral translations and roll deviations.
Upward gusts were easier for bees to fly through, causing only minor flight
changes and minimal recovery times. Downward gusts severely impaired the
control response of bees, inflicting strong adverse forces which sharply upset
trajectories. Bees used interesting control strategies when flying in each
disturbance, offering new insights into insect-scale flapping flight and
bio-inspired robotic systems.

of the proposed distributed filter using the exemplar task of blocking a user

validate the behavior of the proposed multi-class filter with

segmentation, attributes and malignancy prediction is helpful to improve the
performance of each single task. In addition, inspired by the fact that
radiologists often change window widths and window centers to help to make
decision on uncertain nodules, PN-SAMP mixes multiple WW/WC together to gain

strength of breaking 2-D and 3-D gravity water waves, as quantified by the
amount of wave energy dissipated per breaking event. Following Duncan (1983),
the wave energy dissipation rate per unit length of breaking crest may be
related to the fifth moment of the wave speed and the non-dimensional breaking
strength parameter $b$. We use a finite-volume Navier-Stokes solver with LES
resolution and volume-of-fluid surface reconstruction (Derakhti and Kirby
2014a, 2016) to simulate wave packet evolution, breaking onset and
post-breaking evolution for representative cases of wave packets with breaking
due to dispersive focusing and to modulational instability. The present study
uses these results to investigate the relationship between the breaking
strength parameter $b$ and the breaking onset parameter $B$ proposed recently
by Barthelemy et al. (2018). The latter, formed from the local energy flux
normalized by the local energy density and the local crest speed, simplifies,
on the wave surface, to the ratio of fluid speed to crest speed. Following a
wave crest, when $B$ exceeds a generic threshold value at the wave crest
(Barthelemy et al., 2018), breaking is imminent. We find a robust relationship
between the breaking strength parameter $b$ and the rate of change of breaking
onset parameter, $dB/dt$ at the wave crest, as it transitions through the
generic breaking onset threshold ($B\sim 0.85$), scaled by the local period of
the breaking wave. This result significantly refines previous efforts to
express $b$ in terms of a wave packet steepness parameter, which is both
difficult to define robustly and which does not provide a generically accurate
forecast of the energy dissipated by breaking.

Because negative capacitance as such is not a physical concept, we propose an
alternative model that relies on the non-linear and non-equilibrium behavior of
the ferroelectric layer. It is shown that a steep subthreshold slope can be
obtained by a 2-step switching process, referred to as nucleation and
propagation. Making use of the concept of domain wall motion as known also from
fracture dynamics, we are able to explain the steep slope effect. A simple
mathematical model is added to further describe this phenomenon, and to further
investigate its eventual benefit for obtaining steep slope transistors in the

technique in conjunction with the superposition of incident waves brings in
several salient benefits. First, the framework of our theoretical analysis can
be applied to both the inverse obstacle and medium scattering problems. Second,
for inverse obstacle scattering, the underlying boundary condition could be of

using various combinations of four bands and clustered with the K-Means and
Mean Shift algorithms. Neither algorithm was able to consistently segment the
colour distributions: while some distinct features in colour space were
apparent in visual examinations, these features were not compact or isolated

lack of massive amounts of labeled data. Compared to conventional methods,
which learn shared feature subspaces or reuse important source instances with
shallow representations, deep domain adaption methods leverage deep networks to
learn more transferable representations by embedding domain adaptation in the
pipeline of deep learning. There have been comprehensive surveys for shallow
domain adaption, but few timely reviews the emerging deep learning based
methods. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of deep domain
adaptation methods for computer vision applications with four major
contributions. First, we present a taxonomy of different deep domain adaption
scenarios according to the properties of data that define how two domains are
diverged. Second, we summarize deep domain adaption approaches into several
categories based on training loss, and analyze and compare briefly the
state-of-the-art methods under these categories. Third, we overview the
computer vision applications that go beyond image classification, such as face
recognition, semantic segmentation and object detection. Fourth, some potential
deficiencies of current methods and several future directions are highlighted.

learning method, called feature-distributed stochastic variance reduced

lensing candidates by maybe three orders of magnitudes beyond the number known
today. Finding these rare objects will require picking them out of at least
tens of millions of images and deriving scientific results from them will
require quantifying the efficiency and bias of any search method. To achieve
these objectives automated methods must be developed. Because gravitational
lenses are rare objects reducing false positives will be particularly
important. We present a description and results of an open gravitational lens
finding challenge. Participants were asked to classify 100,000 candidate

developing better automated methods for finding lenses in large data sets. A
variety of methods were used including visual inspection, arc and ring finders,
support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We find
that many of the methods will be easily fast enough to analyse the anticipated
data flow. In test data, several methods are able to identify upwards of half
the lenses after applying some thresholds on the lens characteristics such as
lensed image brightness, size or contrast with the lens galaxy without making a
single false-positive identification. This is significantly better than direct
inspection by humans was able to do. (abridged)

viscosity changing chemical reaction of type A+B --> C, when a solution of
reactant A is injected into a solution of B and a product C of different
viscosity is formed. We investigate here numerically such reactive viscous
fingering in the case of a reaction decreasing the viscosity to define the
optimal conditions on the chemical and hydrodynamic parameters for controlling
fingering. In particular, we analyze the influence of the injection flow rate
or equivalently of the Peclet number (Pe) of the problem on the efficiency of
the chemical control of fingering. We show that the viscosity decreasing
reaction has an increased stabilizing effect when Pe is decreased. On the
contrary, fingering is more intense and the system more unstable when Pe is
increased. The related reactive fingering patterns cover then respectively a
smaller (larger) area than in the non-reactive equivalent. Depending on the
value of the flow rate, a given chemical reaction may thus either enhance or
suppress a fingering instability. This stabilization and destabilization at low
and high Pe are shown to be related to the Pe-dependent characteristics of a
minimum in the viscosity profile that develops around the miscible interface
thanks to the effect of the chemical reaction.

  Classical Physics with Classical Zero-Point Radiation","27 pages and 3 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based upon thermodynamic ideas, two new derivations of the Planck blackbody
spectrum are given within classical physics which includes classical zero-point
radiation. The first and second laws of thermodynamics, applied to a harmonic
oscillator or a radiation normal mode, require that the canonical potential
$\phi(\omega/T)$ is a function of a single variable corresponding to the ratio
of the oscillation frequency to the temperature. The second law of
thermodynamics involves extremum ideas which may be applied to thermal
radiation. Our first derivation of the Planck spectrum is based upon the idea
that the canonical potential $\phi(\omega/T)$ is a monotonic function and all
its derivatives are monotonic when interpolating between zero-point energy at
low temperature and energy equipartition at high temperature; the monotonic
behavior precludes the canonical potential from giving a preferred value for
the ratio $\omega/T.$ Our second derivation of the Planck spectrum is based
upon the requirement that the change in the Helmholtz free energy of the
radiation in a partitioned box held at constant temperature should be a minimum
at thermal equilibrium. Finally, the change in Casimir energy with change in
partition position for the radiation in a partitioned box is shown to
correspond at high temperature to the absence of zero-point energy when the
spectral energy per normal mode is chosen as the traditional Planck spectrum
which omits zero-point energy at low temperature; thus the idea of zero-point
energy is embedded in the traditional Planck spectrum. It is emphasized that
thermal radiation is intimately connected with zero-point radiation and the
structure of spacetime in classical physics.

consensus is shorter than the binary vote model from both numerical simulations

plurality-vote model. When intervention such as opinion conversion is allowed,
as in the case of sudden change of mind of voter for any reason, the effort
needed to push the fragmented three-opinion population in the thermodynamic
limit to the consensus state, measured in minimal intervention cost, is less
than that needed to push a polarized two-opinion population to the consensus
state, when the degree ($p$) of homophily is less than 0.8. For finite system,
the fragmented three-opinion population will spontaneously reach the consensus
state, with faster time to consensus, compared to polarized two-opinion

applications on powerful machines. The key drivers towards this paradigm for

on-demand provisioning and cross-platform interoperability. To fully harness
the Cloud services for scientific computing, however, we need to design an
application-specific platform to help the users efficiently migrate their

expressions through C/C++, Python, Java APIs and SNC script. Just-In-Time (JIT)
compilation through using LLVM/JVM is used to compile the user code to the

symbolic-numeric computation applications (including nonlinear minimization,
Monte Carlo integration, finite element assembly and multibody dynamics) on
several popular cloud platforms (including the Google Compute Engine, Amazon

demonstrate that our approach can work across multiple cloud platforms, support
different languages and significantly improve the performance of
symbolic-numeric computation using cloud platforms. This offered a way to

the source ($A$) and target ($B$) image domains, where in many applications
aligned image pairs are not available at training. This is an ill-posed
learning problem since it requires inferring the joint probability distribution
from marginals. Joint learning of coupled mappings $F_{AB}: A \rightarrow B$
and $F_{BA}: B \rightarrow A$ is commonly used by the state-of-the-art methods,
like CycleGAN [Zhu et al., 2017], to learn this translation by introducing
cycle consistency requirement to the learning problem, i.e. $F_{AB}(F_{BA}(B))
\approx B$ and $F_{BA}(F_{AB}(A)) \approx A$. Cycle consistency enforces the
preservation of the mutual information between input and translated images.
However, it does not explicitly enforce $F_{BA}$ to be an inverse operation to
$F_{AB}$. We propose a new deep architecture that we call invertible
autoencoder (InvAuto) to explicitly enforce this relation. This is done by
forcing an encoder to be an inverted version of the decoder, where
corresponding layers perform opposite mappings and share parameters. The
mappings are constrained to be orthonormal. The resulting architecture leads to
the reduction of the number of trainable parameters (up to $2$ times). We
present image translation results on benchmark data sets and demonstrate
state-of-the art performance of our approach. Finally, we test the proposed
domain adaptation method on the task of road video conversion. We demonstrate
that the videos converted with InvAuto have high quality and show that the
NVIDIA neural-network-based end-to-end learning system for autonomous driving,
known as PilotNet, trained on real road videos performs well when tested on the
converted ones.
