used to characterize the real-space topology of the Rice-Mele model. Through
studying the energy spectrum of the model under different boundary conditions,
we found that the non-normalizable wave function for the infinite domain is
reduced to the edge state adhered to the boundary. For the finite domain with
symmetric boundary condition, the critical point for the topological phase
transition is equal to the inverse of the domain length. In contrast, the
critical point is zero for the semi-infinite domain. Additionally, the symmetry
of the energy spectrum is found to be sensitive to the boundary conditions of
the Rice-Mele model, and the emergence of the edge states as well as the
topological phase transition can be reflected in the thermodynamic properties.
A potentially practical scheme is proposed for simulating the Rice-Mele model
and detecting the relevant thermodynamic quantities in the context of
Bose-Einstein condensate.

admitting an easily configurable and flexible implementation, which is an
obvious advantage over the existing nonbinary polar codes based on Reed-Solomon

environment. Here we report the first unambiguous observation of efficient
noise-seeded backward stimulated Raman scattering in a hydrogen-filled
hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. At high gas pressures, when the backward
Raman gain is comparable with, but lower than, the forward gain, we report
quantum conversion efficiencies exceeding 40% to the backward Stokes at 683 nm
from a narrowband 532-nm-pump. The efficiency increases to 65% when the
backward process is seeded by a small amount of back-reflected
forward-generated Stokes light. At high pump powers the backward Stokes signal,
emitted in a clean fundamental mode and spectrally pure, is unexpectedly always
stronger than its forward-propagating counterpart. We attribute this striking
observation to the unique temporal dynamics of the interacting fields, which
cause the Raman coherence (which takes the form of a moving fine-period Bragg
grating) to grow in strength towards the input end of the fiber. A good
understanding of this process, together with the rapid development of novel

  results",,,,"math.RA math.CO math.OA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For every square matrix $A$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$, we have the equality
$\mathrm{rank}(A) + \mathrm{rank}(I-A) = \mathrm{rank}(I) +
\mathrm{rank}(A-A^2)$ where $I$ denotes the identity matrix with the same
dimensions as $A$. In this article, we start a program to systematically
characterize and generalize such rank identities with a view towards
applications to operator algebras. We initiate the study of so-called ranked
rings (unital rings with a `rank-system'), the main examples of interest being
finite von Neumann algebras, Murray-von Neumann algebras, and von Neumann
rank-rings. In our framework, a field $\mathbb{K}$ may be viewed as a ranked
ring with a $\mathbb{Z}^+$-valued rank-system consisting of the usual rank
functions on $M_n(\mathbb{K})$ (for $n \in \mathbb{N})$ and serves as the
motivating example. We show that a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{R}$
with center $\mathscr{C}$ (and the corresponding Murray-von Neumann algebra
$\mathscr{R}_{\textrm{aff}}$) may be endowed with a $\mathscr{C}^{+}$-valued
rank-system, considering $\mathscr{C}^{+}$ as a commutative monoid with respect
to operator addition. We give an algorithm to generate rank identities in
ranked $\mathbb{K}$-algebras via the polynomial function calculus, and in
ranked complex Banach algebras via the holomorphic function calculus. As an
illustrative application, using these abstract rank identities we show that the
sum of finitely many idempotents $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ in a finite von Neumann
algebra is an idempotent if and only if they are mutually orthogonal, that is,
$e_i e_j = \delta_{ij} e_i$ for $1 \le i, j \le m$. In contrast, this does not
hold in general in the ring of bounded operators on an infinite-dimensional
complex Hilbert space.

around Sr2+ suggests a stable 8-fold geometry in the local hydration

-331.8 kcal/mol is comparable with the experimental result of -334 kcal/mol,
the value is significantly more favorable than the -305 kcal/mol hydration free
energy of Ba2+. When placed in the innermost K+ channel blocking site, the
solvation free energies and lowest energy structures of both Sr2+ and Ba2+ are

inflation models turned out to be strongly disfavored. Axion inflation is one
of such models which is becoming marginalized with the increasing precession of
CMB data. In this paper, we have shown that with a simple Galileon type
modification to the marginally favored axion model calling G-axion, we can turn
them into one of the most favored models with its detectable prediction of $r$
and $n_s$ within its PLANCK $1\sigma $ range for a wide range of parameters.
Interestingly it is this modification which plays the important role in turning
the inflationary predictions to be independent of the explicit value of axion
decay constant $f$. However, dynamics after the inflation turned out to have a
non-trivial dependence on $f$. For each G-axion model there exists a critical
value of $f_c$ such that for $f>f_c$ we have the oscillating phase after
inflation and for $f<f_c$ we have non-oscillatory phase. Therefore, we obtained
a range of sub-Planckian value of model parameters which give rise to
consistent inflation. However for sub-Planckian axion decay constant the
inflaton field configuration appeared to be singular after the end of
inflation. To reheat the universe we, therefore, employ the instant preheating
mechanism at the instant of first zero crossing of the inflaton. To our
surprise, the instant preheating mechanism turned out to be inefficient as
opposed to usual non-oscillatory quintessence model. For another class of

changes to input that can cause large changes in output. It is also
demonstrated that there exist input-agnostic perturbations, called universal
adversarial perturbations, which can change the inference of target model on
most of the data samples. However, existing methods to craft universal
perturbations are (i) task specific, (ii) require samples from the training
data distribution, and (iii) perform complex optimizations. Additionally,
because of the data dependence, fooling ability of the crafted perturbations is
proportional to the available training data. In this paper, we present a novel,
generalizable and data-free approaches for crafting universal adversarial
perturbations. Independent of the underlying task, our objective achieves
fooling via corrupting the extracted features at multiple layers. Therefore,
the proposed objective is generalizable to craft image-agnostic perturbations
across multiple vision tasks such as object recognition, semantic segmentation,
and depth estimation. In the practical setting of black-box attack scenario
(when the attacker does not have access to the target model and it's training
data), we show that our objective outperforms the data dependent objectives to
fool the learned models. Further, via exploiting simple priors related to the
data distribution, our objective remarkably boosts the fooling ability of the
crafted perturbations. Significant fooling rates achieved by our objective
emphasize that the current deep learning models are now at an increased risk,
since our objective generalizes across multiple tasks without the requirement
of training data for crafting the perturbations. To encourage reproducible
research, we have released the codes for our proposed algorithm.

and smooth locomotion, existing methods use motion capture, finite state
machines or morphology-specific knowledge to guide the motion generation
algorithms. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for the
automatic creation of locomotion control. Indeed, a standard benchmark for DRL
is to automatically create a running controller for a biped character from a
simple reward function. Although several different DRL algorithms can
successfully create a running controller, the resulting motions usually look
nothing like a real runner. This paper takes a minimalist learning approach to
the locomotion problem, without the use of motion examples, finite state
machines, or morphology-specific knowledge. We introduce two modifications to
the DRL approach that, when used together, produce locomotion behaviors that
are symmetric, low-energy, and much closer to that of a real person. First, we
introduce a new term to the loss function (not the reward function) that
encourages symmetric actions. Second, we introduce a new curriculum learning
method that provides modulated physical assistance to help the character with
left/right balance and forward movement. The algorithm automatically computes
appropriate assistance to the character and gradually relaxes this assistance,
so that eventually the character learns to move entirely without help. Because
our method does not make use of motion capture data, it can be applied to a
variety of character morphologies. We demonstrate locomotion controllers for
the lower half of a biped, a full humanoid, a quadruped, and a hexapod. Our
results show that learned policies are able to produce symmetric, low-energy
gaits. In addition, speed-appropriate gait patterns emerge without any guidance
from motion examples or contact planning.

local normal is controlled by the gravity of the major planets. Specifically,
its inclination and longitude of ascending node varies with semi-major axis and

perturbation theory; the $\nu_{16}$ nodal secular resonance is predicted to
cause a significant warp of the mid-plane in the inner asteroid belt. We test
the secular theory by measuring the current location of the asteroids'

encouraging the learned representations to exhibit small differences between

different videos. An extensive experimental evaluation is presented, where we
validate the proposed models on various tasks. First, we show how the learned

Second, we show the benefits of such an unsupervised learning from just

bulk field $\phi^{(0)}$ as a smeared operator in the CFT. A series of $1/N$
corrections must be added to $\phi^{(0)}$ to represent an interacting bulk
field $\phi$. These corrections have been determined in the literature from
several points of view. Here we develop a new perspective. We show that
correlation functions involving $\phi^{(0)}$ suffer from ambiguities due to
analytic continuation. As a result $\phi^{(0)}$ fails to be a well-defined
linear operator in the CFT. This means bulk reconstruction can be understood as
a procedure for building up well-defined operators in the CFT which thereby
singles out the interacting field $\phi$. We further propose that the
difficulty with defining $\phi^{(0)}$ as a linear operator can be
re-interpreted as a breakdown of associativity. Presumably $\phi^{(0)}$ can
only be corrected to become an associative operator in perturbation theory.
This suggests that quantum mechanics in the bulk is only valid in perturbation

increased focus is related to quantum key distribution and distributed quantum
computation. In this setting, a quantum channel connects a sender to a
receiver, and their goal is to distill either a secret key or entanglement,
along with the help of arbitrary local operations and classical communication
(LOCC). In this work, we establish a general theory of energy-constrained,
LOCC-assisted private and quantum capacities of quantum channels, which are the
maximum rates at which an LOCC-assisted quantum channel can reliably establish
secret key or entanglement, respectively, subject to an energy constraint on
the channel input states. We prove that the energy-constrained squashed
entanglement of a channel is an upper bound on these capacities. We also
explicitly prove that a thermal state maximizes a relaxation of the squashed
entanglement of all phase-insensitive, single-mode input bosonic Gaussian
channels, generalizing results from prior work. After doing so, we prove that a
variation of the method introduced in [Goodenough et al., New J. Phys. 18,

secret-key-agreement capacity of a bosonic thermal channel. We then consider a
multipartite setting and prove that two known multipartite generalizations of
the squashed entanglement are in fact equal. We finally show that the

turbulent flows based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods. The DG
discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations uses the local
Lax-Friedrichs flux for the convective term, the symmetric interior penalty
method for the viscous term, and central fluxes for the velocity-pressure
coupling terms. Stability of the discretization approach for under-resolved,
turbulent flow problems is realized by a purely numerical stabilization
approach. Consistent penalty terms that enforce the incompressibility
constraint as well as inter-element continuity of the velocity field in a weak
sense render the numerical method a robust discretization scheme in the
under-resolved regime. The penalty parameters are derived by means of
dimensional analysis using penalty factors of order 1. Applying these penalty
terms in a postprocessing step leads to an efficient solution algorithm for
turbulent flows. The proposed approach is applicable independently of the
solution strategy used to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
i.e., it can be used for both projection-type solution methods as well as
monolithic solution approaches. Since our approach is based on consistent
penalty terms, it is by definition generic and provides optimal rates of
convergence when applied to laminar flow problems. Robustness and accuracy are
verified for the Orr-Sommerfeld stability problem, the Taylor-Green vortex
problem, and turbulent channel flow. Moreover, the accuracy of high-order
discretizations as compared to low-order discretizations is investigated for
these flow problems. A comparison to state-of-the-art computational approaches
for large-eddy simulation indicates that the proposed methods are highly
attractive components for turbulent flow solvers.

that arises in the local potential approximation to the Wetterich formulation
of the functional renormalization group equation. A cut-off-dependent shift of
the potential in this partial differential equation is performed. This shift
allows a perturbative asymptotic treatment of the differential equation for
large values of the infrared cut-off. To leading order in perturbation theory
the differential equation becomes a heat equation, where the sign of the
diffusion constant changes as the space-time dimension $D$ passes through $2$.
When $D<2$, one obtains a forward heat equation whose initial-value problem is
well-posed. However, for $D>2$ one obtains a backward heat equation whose
initial-value problem is ill-posed. For the special case $D=1$ the asymptotic
series for cubic and quartic models is extrapolated to the small
infrared-cut-off limit by using Pad\'e techniques. The effective potential thus
obtained from the partial differential equation is then used in a
Schr\""odinger-equation setting to study the stability of the ground state. For
cubic potentials it is found that this Pad\'e procedure distinguishes between a
$PT$-symmetric $ig\phi^3$ theory and a conventional Hermitian $g\phi^3$ theory
($g$ real). For an $ig\phi^3$ theory the effective potential is nonsingular and
has a stable ground state but for a conventional $g\phi^3$ theory the effective
potential is singular. For a conventional Hermitian $g\phi^4$ theory and a
$PT$-symmetric $-g\phi^4$ theory ($g>0$) the results are similar; the effective
potentials in both cases are nonsingular and possess stable ground states.

defined in terms of a single interaction enthalpy parameter, h, for the case of
equiprobable distribution of bistate units. For non-equiprobable distributions,
the equilibrium distribution can be characterized by providing a fixed value
for the fraction of units in the active state (x1), corresponding to the
influence of a per-unit activation enthalpy, together with the pairwise
interaction enthalpy parameter h. This paper provides verification and
validation (V&V) for code that computes the configuration variable and
thermodynamic values for 2-D CVM grids characterized by different interaction
enthalpy parameters, or h-values. This work provides a foundation for
experimenting with a 2-D CVM-based hidden layer that can, as an alternative to
responding strictly to inputs, also now independently come to its own free
energy minimum and also return to a free energy-minimized state after
perturbations, which will enable a range of input-independent behaviors. A
further use of this 2-D CVM grid is that by characterizing local patterns in
terms of their corresponding h-values (together with their x1 values), we have
a means for quantitatively characterizing different kinds of neural
topographies.

Android malware behavior to date, analyzing over 1.2 million malware samples
that belong to 1.2K families over a period of eight years (from 2010 to 2017).
We aim at understanding how the behavior of Android malware has evolved over
time, focusing on repackaging malware. In this type of threats different
innocuous apps are piggybacked with a malicious payload (rider), allowing
inexpensive malware manufacturing.
  One of the main challenges posed when studying repackaged malware is slicing
the app to split benign components apart from the malicious ones. To address
this problem, we use differential analysis to isolate software components that
are irrelevant to the campaign and study the behavior of malicious riders
alone. Our analysis framework relies on collective repositories and recent
advances on the systematization of intelligence extracted from multiple
anti-virus vendors. We find that since its infancy in 2010, the Android malware
ecosystem has changed significantly, both in the type of malicious activity
performed by the malicious samples and in the level of obfuscation used by
malware to avoid detection. We then show that our framework can aid analysts
who attempt to study unknown malware families. Finally, we discuss what our
findings mean for Android malware detection research, highlighting areas that
need further attention by the research community.

Catalonia (North-Eastern Spain), a key European region in political and
economic terms. Our analysis relies on recent, abundant empirical data that is
studied within an analytic model of population dynamics. This model
contemplates the possibilities of long-term language coexistence or extinction.
We establish that the most likely scenario is a sustained coexistence. The data
needs to be interpreted under different circumstances, some of them leading to
the asymptotic extinction of one of the languages involved. We delimit the
cases in which this can happen. Asymptotic behavior is often unrealistic as a
predictor for complex social systems, hence we make an attempt at forecasting
trends of speakers towards $2030$. These also suggest sustained coexistence
between both tongues, but some counterintuitive dynamics are unveiled for
extreme cases in which Catalan would be likely to lose an important fraction of
speakers. As an intermediate step, model parameters are obtained that convey
relevant information about the prestige and interlinguistic similarity of the
tongues as perceived by the population. This is the first time that these
parameters are quantified rigorously for this couple of languages. Remarkably,
Spanish is found to have a larger prestige specially in areas which
historically had larger communities of Catalan monolingual speakers. Limited,
spatially-segregated data allows us to examine more fine grained dynamics, thus
better addressing the likely coexistence or extinction. Variation of the model
parameters across regions are informative about how the two languages are
perceived in more urban or rural environments.

this implies the existence of an extraordinarily strong interaction driving the
formation of Cooper pairs, potentially comparable in order of magnitude to that
in some high Tc superconductors. Under suitable conditions the interaction
might remain effective at densities approaching metallic densities, leading to
the possibility of pair formation at elevated temperatures. Here we investigate
the pressure dependence of the resistivity and superconducting transition
temperature, Tc, of SrTiO$_3$ at a carrier density near to optimal doping. Our
experiments show that Tc collapses rapidly with pressure and hence with
increasing frequency of the soft transverse-optical phonon mode connected to
the ferroelectric quantum critical point. We show that the superconductivity
phase diagram can be understood in terms of the coupling of electrons via two
hybrid longitudinal polar modes, based on a model of dipolar fluctuations of
the charge carrier-ion system. In particular, we predict that for carrier
densities above the order of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, Tc can be strongly enhanced
on approaching the ferroelectric quantum critical point, as seen in our
measurements of SrTiO$_3$ and as found in many electrically conducting magnetic
analogues. However below this density we predict the reverse behaviour, namely
that Tc is suppressed on approaching the ferroelectric quantum critical point.

reflected cases, which correlated positively with expected multiplication, but
the nature of the correlation (sub or super linear) changed between material

interacting binary-system during which two stars orbit inside a single shared
envelope. Such evolution is thought to lead to the inspiral of the binary, the
ejection of the extended envelope and the formation of a remnant short-period
binary. However, detailed hydrodynamical models of CEE encounter major
difficulties. They show that following the inspiral most of the envelope is not
ejected; though it expands to larger separations, it remains bound to the
binary. Here we propose that dust-driven winds can be produced following the
CEE. These can evaporate the envelope following similar processes operating in
the ejection of the envelopes of AGB stars. Pulsations in an AGB-star drives
the expansion of its envelope, allowing the material to cool down to low
temperatures thus enabling dust condensation. Radiation pressure on the dust
accelerates it, and through its coupling to the gas it drives winds which
eventually completely erode the envelope. We show that the inspiral phase in
CE-binaries can effectively replace the role of stellar pulsation and drive the
CE expansion to scales comparable with those of AGB stars, and give rise to
efficient mass-loss through dust-driven winds.

action to a function, $f(R)$, of the scalar curvature. Thus one is able to
describe the emergence and the evolution of the Large Scale Structure without
any additional (unknown) dark component. In the weak field limit of the
$f(R)$-gravity, a modified Newtonian gravitational potential arises. This
gravitational potential accounts for an extra force, generally called fifth
force, that produces a precession of the orbital motion even in the classic
mechanical approach. We have shown that the orbits in the modified potential
can be written as Keplerian orbits under some conditions on the strength and
scale length of this extra force. Nevertheless, we have also shown that this
extra term gives rise to the precession of the orbit. Thus, comparing our
prediction with the measurements of the precession of some planetary motions,
we have found that the strength of the fifth force must be in the range
$[2.70-6.70]\times10^{-9}$ whit the characteristic scale length to fixed to the
fiducial values of $\sim 5000$ AU.

strongly suppressed following some of these events, in contrast to the more
well-known merger-driven starbursts. We present observations with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of six ETGs, which have each
recently undergone a gas-rich minor merger, as evidenced by their disturbed
stellar morphologies. These galaxies were selected because they exhibit
extremely low SFEs. We use the resolving power of ALMA to study the morphology
and kinematics of the molecular gas. The majority of our galaxies exhibit
spatial and kinematical irregularities, such as detached gas clouds, warps, and
other asymmetries. These asymmetries support the interpretation that the
suppression of the SFE is caused by dynamical effects stabilizing the gas
against gravitational collapse. Through kinematic modelling we derive high
velocity dispersions and Toomre Q stability parameters for the gas, but caution
that such measurements in edge-on galaxies suffer from degeneracies. We
estimate merger ages to be about 100~Myr based on the observed disturbances in
the gas distribution. Furthermore, we determine that these galaxies lie, on
average, two orders of magnitude below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for
star-forming galaxies as well as below the relation for relaxed ETGs. We
discuss potential dynamical processes responsible for this strong suppression
of star formation surface density at fixed molecular gas surface density.

taking into account electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) as one of the sources

ejecta from ECSNe contribute to stars with [Zn/Fe] $\gtrsim$ 0.5. We also find
that scatters of [Zn/Fe] in higher metallicity originate from the ejecta of
type Ia supernovae. On the other hand, it appears difficult to explain the
observed trends if we do not consider ECSNe as a source of Zn. These results
come from inhomogeneous spatial metallicity distribution due to the
inefficiency of metal mixing. We find that the optimal value of scaling factor
for metal diffusion coefficient is $\sim$ 0.01 in the shear-based metal mixing
model in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. These results suggest
that ECSNe can be one of the contributors to the enrichment of Zn in galaxies.

experience various chemical transitions --- for example from CO rich L-dwarfs
to methane rich T-dwarfs. Those chemical transitions are accompanied by
spectral transitions whose sharpness cannot be explained by chemistry alone. In
a series of articles, Tremblin et al. proposed that some of the yet unexplained
features associated to these transitions could be explained by a reduction of
the thermal gradient near the photosphere. To explain, in turn, this more
isothermal profile, they invoke the presence of an instability analogous to
fingering convection -- compositional convection -- triggered by the change in
mean molecular weight of the gas due to the chemical transitions mentioned
above. In this short note, we use existing arguments to demonstrate that any
turbulent transport, if present, would in fact increase the thermal gradient.
This misinterpretation comes from the fact that turbulence mixes/homogenizes
entropy (potential temperature) instead of temperature. So, while increasing
transport, turbulence in an initially stratified atmosphere actually carries
energy downward, whether it is due to fingering or any other type of
compositional convection. These processes therefore cannot explain the features
observed along the aforementioned transitions by reducing the thermal gradient
in the atmosphere of substellar objects. Understanding the microphysical and
dynamical properties of clouds at these transitions thus probably remains our
best way forward.

technology to help detect relative tissue ischemia that could lead to
significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. However, some issues
inherent in NIRS technology use on neonates, such as wide fluctuation in
signals, signal dropout and low limit of detection of the device, pose
challenges that may obscure reliable interpretation of the NIRS measurements
using current methods of analysis. In this paper, we propose new statistical
methods to analyse mesenteric rSO2 (regional oxygenation) produced by NIRS to
evaluate oxygenation in intestinal tissues and investigate oxygenation response
to red blood cell transfusion (RBC) in preterm infants. We present a mean area
under the curve (MAUC) measure and a slope measure to capture the mean rSO2
level and temporal trajectory of rSO2, respectively. Estimation methods are
developed for these measures and nonparametric testing procedures are proposed
to detect RBC-related changes in mesenteric oxygenation in preterm infants.
Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed methods demonstrate
improved accuracy in characterizing the mean level and changing pattern of
mesenteric rSO2 and also increased statistical power in detecting RBC-related
changes, as compared with standard approaches. We apply our methods to a NIRS

evaluate the pre- and post-transfusion mesenteric oxygenation in preterm

information-theoretic and in the computational setting, many fundamental
questions about its public-key counterpart resist persistent attempts to solve
them. The computational model for public-key steganography was proposed by von
Ahn and Hopper in EUROCRYPT 2004. At TCC 2005, Backes and Cachin gave the first
universal public-key stegosystem - i.e. one that works on all channels -
achieving security against replayable chosen-covertext attacks (SS-RCCA) and
asked whether security against non-replayable chosen-covertext attacks (SS-CCA)
is achievable. Later, Hopper (ICALP 2005) provided such a stegosystem for every
efficiently sampleable channel, but did not achieve universality. He posed the
question whether universality and SS-CCA-security can be achieved
simultaneously. No progress on this question has been achieved since more than
a decade. In our work we solve Hopper's problem in a somehow complete manner:
As our main positive result we design an SS-CCA-secure stegosystem that works
for every memoryless channel. On the other hand, we prove that this result is
the best possible in the context of universal steganography. We provide a
family of 0-memoryless channels - where the already sent documents have only
marginal influence on the current distribution - and prove that no
SS-CCA-secure steganography for this family exists in the standard

  Ranges and Video",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose hybrid methods for localization in wireless sensor networks fusing
noisy range measurements with angular information (extracted from video).
Compared with conventional methods that rely on a single sensed variable, this
may pave the way for improved localization accuracy and robustness. We address
both the single-source and network (i.e., cooperative multiple-source)
localization paradigms, solving them via optimization of a convex surrogate.
The formulations for hybrid localization are unified in the sense that we
propose a single nonlinear least-squares cost function, fusing both angular and
range measurements. We then relax the problem to obtain an estimate of the
optimal positions. This contrasts with other hybrid approaches that alternate
the execution of localization algorithms for each type of measurement
separately, to progressively refine the position estimates. Single-source
localization uses a semidefinite relaxation to obtain a one-shot matrix
solution from which the source position is derived via factorization. Network
localization uses a different approach where sensor coordinates are retained as
optimization variables, and the relaxed cost function is efficiently minimized
using fast iterations based on Nesterov's optimal method. Further, an automated
calibration procedure is developed to express range and angular information,
obtained by different devices, possibly deployed at different locations, in a
single consistent coordinate system. This drastically reduces the need for
manual calibration that would otherwise negatively impact the practical
usability of hybrid range/video localization systems. We develop and test, both
in simulation and experimentally, the new hybrid localization algorithms, which
not only overcome the limitations of previous fusing approaches but also
compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them in some
scenarios.

paradigm is a line of first order transitions which ends at a critical
endpoint.
  In this work we suggest that spatially inhomogenous phases are a generic
feature of the hadronic phase diagram at nonzero mu and low T . Familiar
examples are pion and kaon condensates. At higher densities, we argue that
these condensates connect onto chiral spirals in a quarkyonic regime. Both of
these phases exhibit the spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry and
quasi-long range order, analogous to smectic liquid crystals. We argue that
there is a continuous line of first order transitions which separate spatially
inhomogenous from homogenous phases, where the latter can be either a hadronic
phase or a quark-gluon plasma.
  While mean field theory predicts that there is a Lifshitz point along this
line of first order transitions, in three spatial dimensions strong infrared
fluctuations wash out any Lifshitz point. Using known results from inhomogenous
polymers, we suggest that instead there is a Lifshitz regime. Non-perturbative
effects are large in this regime, where the momentum dependent terms for the
propagators of pions and associated modes are dominated not by terms quadratic
in momenta, but quartic. Fluctuations in a Lifshitz regime may be directly
relevant to the collisions of heavy ions at (relatively) low energies,
sqrt(s)/A : 1 to 20 GeV.

major challenge. Traditional examples of this include social network spam, but
an important new concern is the propagation of fake news through social media.
A common approach for mitigating this problem is by using standard statistical
classification to distinguish malicious (e.g., fake news) instances from benign
(e.g., actual news stories). However, such an approach ignores the fact that
malicious instances propagate through the network, which is consequential both
in quantifying consequences (e.g., fake news diffusing through the network),
and capturing detection redundancy (bad content can be detected at different
nodes). An additional concern is evasion attacks, whereby the generators of
malicious instances modify the nature of these to escape detection. We model
this problem as a Stackelberg game between the defender who is choosing
parameters of the detection model, and an attacker, who is choosing both the
node at which to initiate malicious spread, and the nature of malicious
entities. We develop a novel bi-level programming approach for this problem, as
well as a novel solution approach based on implicit function gradients, and

models that include additional non-compact spacetime dimensions, as the
gravitational waves propagate, they ""leak"" into the extra dimensions, leading
to a reduction in the amplitude of the observed gravitational waves, and a
commensurate systematic error in the inferred distance to the gravitational
wave source. Electromagnetic waves would remain unaffected. We compare the
inferred distance to GW170817 from the observation of gravitational waves,
$d_L^\mathrm{GW}$, with the inferred distance to the electromagnetic
counterpart NGC 4993, $d_L^\mathrm{EM}$. We constrain $d_L^\mathrm{GW} =

independent, accurate, and precise masses, radii, effective temperatures and
metallicities of long period eclipsing binary stars with a red giant component
that displays solar-like oscillations. We measured precise properties of the
three eclipsing binary systems KIC 7037405, KIC 9540226, and KIC 9970396 and
estimated their ages be $5.3\pm0.5$, $3.1\pm0.6$, and $4.8\pm0.5$ Gyr. The
measurements of the giant stars were compared to corresponding measurements of

We found that asteroseismic scaling relations without corrections to
$\Delta\nu$ systematically overestimate the masses of the three red giants by
11.7%, 13.7%, and 18.9%, respectively. However, by applying theoretical
correction factors $f_{\Delta\nu}$ according to Rodrigues et al. (2017), we
reached general agreement between dynamical and asteroseismic mass estimates,
and no indications of systematic differences at the precision level of the
asteroseismic measurements. The larger sample investigated by Gaulme et al.
(2016) showed a much more complicated situation, where some stars show
agreement between the dynamical and corrected asteroseismic measures while
others suggest significant overestimates of the asteroseismic measures. We
found no simple explanation for this, but indications of several potential

spin and measuring its polarisation after being scattered from the sample. A
control system running on a microcontroller is used to perform the spin
rotation and to calculate the polarisation of the scattered beam based on a
lock-in amplifier. First experimental tests of the method on a helium spin-echo

question is: how hard is it to compute a sequence that covers $2^{\mathbb{N}}$

geometry of spacetime in the language of Hamilton geometry. The dispersion
relation is interpreted as the Hamiltonian which determines the motion of point
particles. It is a function on the cotangent bundle of spacetime, i.e. on phase
space, and determines the geometry of phase space completely, in a similar way
as the metric determines the geometry of spacetime in general relativity. After
a review of the general Hamilton geometry of phase space we discuss two
examples. The phase space geometry of the metric Hamiltonian
$H_g(x,p)=g^{ab}(x)p_ap_b$ and the phase space geometry of the first order q-de
Sitter dispersion relation of the form $H_{qDS}(x,p)=g^{ab}(x)p_ap_b + \ell
G^{abc}(x)p_ap_bp_c$ which is suggested from quantum gravity phenomenology. We
will see that for the metric Hamiltonian $H_g$ the geometry of phase space is
equivalent to the standard metric spacetime geometry from general relativity.
For the q-de Sitter Hamiltonian $H_{qDS}$ the Hamilton equations of motion for
point particles do not become autoparallels but contain a force term, the
momentum space part of phase space is curved and the curvature of spacetime
becomes momentum dependent.

provide a rigid calculation procedure to follow. This paper aims to bridge the
gap between high-level methodologies and the practical application of modelling
algorithms, with a focus on the industrial buildings sector. This is achieved
with the development of a novel, machine learning supported methodology for M&V
2.0 which enables accurate quantification of savings.
  A novel and computationally efficient feature selection algorithm and
powerful machine learning regression algorithms are employed to maximise the
effectiveness of available data. The baseline period energy consumption is
modelled using artificial neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest
neighbours and multiple ordinary least squares regression. Improved knowledge
discovery and an expanded boundary of analysis allow more complex energy
systems be analysed, thus increasing the applicability of M&V. A case study in
a large biomedical manufacturing facility is used to demonstrate the
methodology's ability to accurately quantify the savings under real-world
conditions. The ECM was found to result in 604,527 kWh of energy savings with
57% uncertainty at a confidence interval of 68%. 20 baseline energy models are
developed using an exhaustive approach with the optimal model being used to
quantify savings. The range of savings estimated with each model are presented

that the leading-order ($1/k^{4}$) behavior of the diagonal elements of the
momentum distribution function (i.e., $n_{\uparrow\uparrow}({\bf k})$ and
$n_{\downarrow\downarrow}({\bf k})$) are not modified by the SOC. However, the
SOC can significantly modify the behavior of the \textit{non-diagonal elements}
of the momentum distribution function, i.e., $n_{\uparrow\downarrow}({\bf k})$
and $n_{\downarrow\uparrow}({\bf k})$, in the large-$k$ limit. In the absence
of the SOC, the leading order of these elements is ${\cal O}(1/k^{6})$. When
SOC appears, it can induce a term on the order of $1/k^{5}$. We further derive
the adiabatic relation and the energy functional. Our results show the SOC can
induce a new term in the energy functional, which simply describe the
contribution from the SOC to the total energy. The form of the adiabatic

Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing
in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results
emphasize that a complex interaction of fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can
underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in

stars; too little removal and rotation ensures stellar densities are never
reached, too much and the absence of rotation means no protoplanetary disks can
form. Magnetic diffusion is seen as a pathway to resolving this long-standing
problem. We investigate the impact of including resistive MHD in simulations of
the gravitational collapse of a 1 solar mass gas sphere, from molecular cloud
densities to the formation of the protostellar seed; the second Larson core. We
used the AMR code RAMSES to perform two 3D simulations of collapsing magnetised
gas spheres, including self-gravity, radiative transfer, and a non-ideal gas
equation of state to describe H2 dissociation which leads to the second
collapse. The first run was carried out under the ideal MHD approximation,
while ambipolar and ohmic diffusion was incorporated in the second calculation.
In the ideal MHD simulation, the magnetic field dominates the energy budget
everywhere inside and around the first core, fueling interchange instabilities
and driving a low-velocity outflow. High magnetic braking removes essentially
all angular momentum from the second core. On the other hand, ambipolar and
ohmic diffusion create a barrier which prevents amplification of the magnetic
field beyond 0.1 G in the first Larson core which is now fully thermally
supported. A significant amount of rotation is preserved and a small
Keplerian-like disk forms around the second core. When studying the radiative
efficiency of the first and second core accretion shocks, we found that it can
vary by several orders of magnitude over the 3D surface of the cores. Magnetic
diffusion is a pre-requisite to star-formation; it enables the formation of
protoplanetary disks in which planets will eventually form, and also plays a
determinant role in the formation of the protostar itself.

differing between the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. CO ice is not
detected towards sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and upper limits put
its relative abundance well below sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the
Milky Way. We use our gas-grain chemical code MAGICKAL, with multiple grain
sizes and grain temperatures, and further expand it with a treatment for
increased interstellar radiation field intensity to model the elevated dust
temperatures observed in the MCs. We also adjust the elemental abundances used
in the chemical models, guided by observations of HII regions in these
metal-poor satellite galaxies. With a grid of models, we are able to reproduce
the relative ice fractions observed in MC massive young stellar objects
(MYSOs), indicating that metal depletion and elevated grain temperature are
important drivers of the MYSO envelope ice composition. Magellanic Cloud
elemental abundances have a sub-galactic C/O ratio, increasing H$_2$O ice
abundances relative to the other ices; elevated grain temperatures favor CO$_2$
production over H$_2$O and CO. The observed shortfall in CO in the Small
Magellanic Cloud can be explained by a combination of reduced carbon abundance
and increased grain temperatures. The models indicate that a large variation in
radiation field strength is required to match the range of observed LMC

gravitational radiation rings down, encoding information about the new black
hole's recent history and current state.It is expected that this ringdown
radiation will be composed primarily of Kerr quasinormal modes, and thereby
enable tests of general relativity.Here, the first complete ringdown signal
model for nonprecessing binary black hole systems is presented: multipole
amplitudes and phases are modeled as functions of initial binary parameters. It
is found that using the peak time of the dominant merger multipole as a
reference results in the dominant mode's excitation being a remarkably simple
linear function of system parameters, strongly suggesting that an analytic
treatment may be within reach.In particular, for initially nonspinning black
holes, the dominant quadrupole is excited as -4 times the system's symmetric
mass ratio.Application of the model to parameter estimation allows general
relativity predictions for mode amplitudes independently of signal

a prominent curved jet. It is one of the closest known symbiotic systems, and
therefore offers a unique opportunity to study the central regions of these
systems and the formation and evolution of astrophysical jets. We studied the
evolution of the central jet and outer nebula of R Aqr taking advantage of a
long term monitoring campaign of optical imaging, as well as of high-resolution
integral field spectroscopy. Narrow-band images acquired over a period of more
than 21 years are compared in order to study the expansion and evolution of all
components of the R Aqr nebula. The magnification method is used to derive the
kinematic ages of the features that appear to expand radially. Integral field
spectroscopy of the OIII 5007A emission is used to study the velocity structure
of the central regions of the jet. New extended features, further out than the
previously known hourglass nebula, are detected. The kinematic distance to R
Aqr is calculated to be 178 pc using the expansion of the large hourglass
nebula. This nebula of R Aqr is found to be roughly 650 years old, while the
inner regions have ages ranging from 125 to 290 years. The outer nebula is
found to be well described by a ballistic expansion, while for most components
of the jet strong deviations from such behaviour are found. We find that the
Northern jet is mostly red-shifted while its Southern part is blue-shifted,
apparently at odds with findings from previous studies but almost certainly a
consequence of the complex nature of the jet and variations in ionisation and
illumination between observations.

generalized method for detecting life on exoplanets through remote
spectroscopy. Among solar system planets with substantial atmospheres, the
modern Earth has the largest thermodynamic chemical disequilibrium due to the
presence of life. However, how this disequilibrium changed over time and, in
particular, the biogenic disequilibria maintained in the anoxic Archean or less
oxic Proterozoic eons are unknown. We calculate the atmosphere-ocean
disequilibrium in the Precambrian using conservative proxy- and model-based
estimates of early atmospheric and oceanic compositions. We omit crustal solids
because subsurface composition is not detectable on exoplanets, unlike
above-surface volatiles. We find that (i) disequilibrium increased through time
in step with the rise of oxygen; (ii) both the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic may
have had remotely detectable biogenic disequilibria due to the coexistence of
O$_{2}$, N$_{2}$, and liquid water; and (iii) the Archean had a biogenic
disequilibrium caused by the coexistence of N$_2$, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, and liquid
water, which, for an exoplanet twin, may be remotely detectable. On the basis
of this disequilibrium, we argue that the simultaneous detection of abundant
CH$_{4}$ and CO$_{2}$ in a habitable exoplanet's atmosphere is a potential
biosignature. Specifically, we show that methane mixing ratios greater than
0.001 are potentially biogenic, whereas those exceeding 0.01 are likely
biogenic due to the difficulty in maintaining large abiotic methane fluxes to
support high methane levels in anoxic atmospheres. Biogenicity would be
strengthened by the absence of abundant CO, which should not coexist in a
biological scenario.

required for localization. Active Neural Localizer is trained end-to-end with
reinforcement learning. We use a variety of simulation environments for our
experiments which include random 2D mazes, random mazes in the Doom game engine

of learning the policy and perceptual model jointly from raw-pixel based RGB

networks (GANs) with interactive evolutionary computation (IEC). While GANs can
be trained to produce lifelike images, they are normally sampled randomly from
the learned distribution, providing limited control over the resulting output.
On the other hand, interactive evolution has shown promise in creating various
artifacts such as images, music and 3D objects, but traditionally relies on a
hand-designed evolvable representation of the target domain. The main insight
in this paper is that a GAN trained on a specific target domain can act as a
compact and robust genotype-to-phenotype mapping (i.e. most produced phenotypes
do resemble valid domain artifacts). Once such a GAN is trained, the latent
vector given as input to the GAN's generator network can be put under
evolutionary control, allowing controllable and high-quality image generation.
In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of this novel approach through a
user study in which participants were able to evolve images that strongly
resemble specific target images.

driver behavior, and in particular to detect and overcome driver distraction in
an effort to reduce accidents caused by driver negligence. However, as the
domain increasingly shifts towards autonomous and semi-autonomous solutions,
the driver is no longer integral to the decision making process, indicating a
need to refocus efforts elsewhere. To this end, we propose to study pedestrian
distraction instead. In particular, we focus on detecting pedestrians who are
engaged in secondary activities involving their cellphones and similar handheld
multimedia devices from a purely vision-based standpoint. To achieve this
objective, we propose a pipeline incorporating articulated human pose
estimation, followed by a soft object label transfer from an ensemble of
exemplar SVMs trained on the nearest neighbors in pose feature space. We
additionally incorporate head gaze features and prior pose information to carry
out cellphone related pedestrian activity recognition. Finally, we offer a
method to reliably track the articulated pose of a pedestrian through a
sequence of images using a particle filter with a Gaussian Process Dynamical
Model (GPDM), which can then be used to estimate sequentially varying activity
scores at a very low computational cost. The entire framework is fast
(especially for sequential data) and accurate, and easily extensible to include
other secondary activities and sources of distraction.

isophotal fit parameters from the nuclear regions out to a radius of ~10 kpc in
most cases. We find that 37% (13) of the galaxies in our sample have isophotal
position angle rotations greater than 20 degrees over the radial range imaged
by WFC3/IR, which is often due to the presence of neighbors or multiple nuclei.
Most galaxies in our sample are significantly rounder near the center than in
the outer regions. This sample contains six fast rotators and 28 slow rotators.
We find that all fast rotators are either disky or show no measurable deviation
from purely elliptical isophotes. Among slow rotators, significantly disky and
boxy galaxies occur with nearly equal frequency. The galaxies in our sample
often exhibit changing isophotal shapes, sometimes showing both significantly
disky and boxy isophotes at different radii. The fact that parameters vary
widely between galaxies and within individual galaxies is evidence that these
massive galaxies have complicated formation histories, and some of them have
experienced recent mergers and have not fully relaxed. These data demonstrate
the value of high spatial resolution IR imaging of galaxies and provide

to the sublimation of sub-surface water-ice that is exposed when these objects
are impacted by meter-sized bodies. We recently examined this scenario and
showed that such impacts can in fact excavate ice and present a plausible
mechanism for triggering the activation of MBCs (Haghighipour et al. 2016).
However, because the purpose of that study was to prove the concept and
identify the most viable ice-longevity model, the porosity of the object and
the loss of ice due to the heat of impact were ignored. In this paper, we
extend our impact simulations to porous materials and account for the loss of
ice due to an impact. We show that for a porous MBC, impact craters are deeper,
reaching to approximately 15 m implying that if the activation of MBCs is due
to the sublimation of sub-surface ice, this ice has to be within the top 15 m
of the object. Results also indicate that the loss of ice due to the heat of
impact is negligible, and the re-accretion of ejected ice is small. The latter
suggests that the activities of current MBCs are most probably from multiple

  cyclic time-varying covariates, with application to a multiple-dose
  monoclonal antibody clinical trial",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In two harmonized efficacy studies to prevent HIV infection through multiple
infusions of the monoclonal antibody VRC01, a key objective is to evaluate
whether the serum concentration of VRC01, which changes cyclically over time
along with the infusion schedule, is associated with the rate of HIV infection.
Simulation studies are needed in the development of such survival models. In
this paper, we consider simulating event time data with a continuous
time-varying covariate whose values vary with time through multiple drug
administration cycles, and whose effect on survival changes differently before
and after a threshold within each cycle. The latter accommodates settings with
a zero-protection biomarker threshold above which the drug provides a varying
level of protection depending on the biomarker level, but below which the drug
provides no protection. We propose two simulation approaches: one based on
simulating survival data under a single-dose regimen first before data are
aggregated over multiple doses, and another based on simulating survival data
directly under a multiple-dose regimen. We generate time-to-event data
following a Cox proportional hazards model based on inverting the cumulative
hazard function and a log link function for relating the hazard function to the
covariates. The method's validity is assessed in two sets of simulation
experiments. The results indicate that the proposed procedures perform well in
producing data that conform to their cyclic nature and assumptions of the Cox
proportional hazards model.

Observationally, although most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have afterglows that are
consistent with $p>2$, there are still a few GRBs suggestive of a hard ($p<2$)
electron energy spectrum. Our previous work showed that GRB 091127 gave strong
evidence for a double power-law hard electron energy (DPLH) spectrum with
$1<p_1<2$, $p_2>2$ and an ""injection break"" assumed as $\gamma_{\rm b}\propto

the injection break remains uncertain and more such afterglow observations are
needed to test this conjecture.

stochastic optimization problem, whose objective and constraint functions are
non-convex and involve expectations over random states. Most existing methods
for non-convex stochastic optimization, such as the stochastic (average)
gradient and stochastic majorization-minimization, only consider minimizing a
stochastic non-convex objective over a deterministic convex set. The proposed
CSSCA algorithm can also handle stochastic non-convex constraints in
optimization problems, and it opens the way to solving more challenging
optimization problems that occur in many applications. The algorithm is based
on solving a sequence of convex objective/feasibility optimization problems
obtained by replacing the objective/constraint functions in the original
problems with some convex surrogate functions. The CSSCA algorithm allows a
wide class of surrogate functions and thus provides many freedoms to design
good surrogate functions for specific applications. Moreover, it also
facilitates parallel implementation for solving large scale stochastic
optimization problems, which arise naturally in today's signal processing such
as machine learning and big data analysis. We establish the convergence of
CSSCA algorithm with a feasible initial point, and customize the algorithmic
framework to solve several important application problems. Simulations show
that the CSSCA algorithm can achieve superior performance over existing
solutions.

estimating temperature of a single outdoor image, and b) predicting temperature
of the last image in an image sequence. In the first scenario, visual features
are extracted by a convolutional neural network trained on a large-scale image

how volume of training data influences performance. In the second scenario, we
consider the temporal evolution of visual appearance, and construct a recurrent
neural network to predict the temperature of the last image in a given image
sequence. We obtain better prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
models. Further, we investigate how performance varies when information is
extracted from different scene regions, and when images are captured in
different daytime hours. Our approach further reinforces the idea of using only
visual information for cost efficient weather prediction in the future.

is a popular precoding architecture for massive MIMO due to its low hardware
cost and power consumption. In conventional hybrid precoding, both RF and
baseband precoders are adaptive to the real-time channel state information
(CSI). As a result, an individual RF precoder is required for each subcarrier
in wideband systems, leading to high implementation cost. To overcome this
issue, two-timescale hybrid precoding (THP), which adapts the RF precoder to
the channel statistics, has been proposed. Since the channel statistics are
approximately the same over different subcarriers, only a single RF precoder is
required in THP. Despite the advantages of THP, there lacks a unified and
efficient algorithm for its optimization due to the non-convex and stochastic
nature of the problem. Based on stochastic successive convex approximation
(SSCA), we propose an online algorithmic framework called SSCA-THP for general
THP optimization problems, in which the hybrid precoder is updated by solving a
quadratic surrogate optimization problem whenever a new channel sample is
obtained. Then we prove the convergence of SSCA-THP to stationary points.
Finally, we apply SSCA-THP to solve three important THP optimization problems
and verify its advantages over existing solutions.

Langer-Bouchbinder-Lookman (LBL) continuum theory of polycrystalline plasticity

instability emerges because thermal heating is faster than heat dissipation,
recrystallization is interpreted as an entropic effect arising from the

that our theory closely matches recent results in sheared ultrafine-grained

of random access response (RAR) at the users are the most important steps in
the initial random access (RA) procedure. However, due to the limited
availability of physical resources dedicated for RA, successful completion of
RA requests would become increasingly difficult in high user density scenarios,
due to contention among users requesting RA. In this paper, we propose to use
the large antenna array at the massive MIMO BS to jointly group RA requests
from different users using the same RA preamble. We then beamform the common
RAR of each detected user group onto the same frequency resource, in such a way
that most users in the group can reliably decode the RAR. The proposed RAR
beamforming therefore automatically resolves the problem of collision between
multiple RA requests on the same RA preamble, which reduces the RA latency
significantly as compared to LTE. Analysis and simulations also reveal that for
a fixed desired SINR of the received RAR, both the required per-user RA
preamble transmission power and the total RAR beamforming power can be
decreased roughly by 1.5 dB with every doubling in the number of BS antennas.

continued improvements in computing devices. Ferroelectric (FE) and
multiferroic (MF) orders and their manipulation promises an ideal combination
of state variables to reach atto-Joule range for logic and memory (i.e., ~ 30X
lower switching energy than nanoelectronics). In BiFeO3 the coupling between
the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and FE orders is robust at room temperature,
scalable in voltage, stabilized by the FE order, and can be integrated into a
fabrication process for a beyond-CMOS era. The presence of the AFM order and a
canted magnetic moment in this system causes exchange interaction with a
ferromagnet such as CoFe or LSMO. While previous work has shown that exchange
coupling (uniaxial anisotropy) can be controlled with an electric field,
several puzzling issues remain. Perhaps the most intriguing among them is that
the BiFeO3-CoFe bilayer did not demonstrate any electrically controlled
directional anisotropy, i.e., an exchange bias, which is a potential mechanism
for 180o magnetic reversal and is independent of switching kinetics. However,
what is needed/preferred for logic and memory is a magneto-electric mechanism
that works analogous to an applied field, i.e a uni-directional anisotropy that
is voltage modulated. Here, we present the evidence of electrical control of
exchange bias of a laterally scaled spin valve that is exchange-coupled to
BiFeO3 at room temperature. We show that the exchange bias in this bilayer is
thermally robust, electrically controlled and reversible. We anticipate that
magneto-electricity at such scaled dimensions provides a powerful pathway for
computing beyond the modern nanoelectronics transistors by enabling a new class
of non-volatile, ultra-low energy computing elements.

learning agent's update target. Most reinforcement learning methods use an
estimate of the value function, which captures how good it is for the agent to
be in a particular state and is mathematically expressed as the expected sum of
discounted future rewards (called the return). These values can be
straightforwardly estimated by averaging batches of returns using Monte Carlo
methods. However, if we wish to update the agent's value estimates during
learning--before terminal outcomes are observed--we must use a different
estimation target called the {\lambda}-return, which truncates the return with
the agent's own estimate of the value function. Temporal difference learning
methods estimate the expected {\lambda}-return for each state, allowing these
methods to update online and incrementally, and in most cases achieve better
generalization error and faster learning than Monte Carlo methods. Naturally
one could attempt to estimate higher-order moments of the {\lambda}-return.
This paper is about estimating the variance of the {\lambda}-return. Prior work
has shown that given estimates of the variance of the {\lambda}-return,
learning systems can be constructed to (1) mitigate risk in action selection,
and (2) automatically adapt the parameters of the learning process itself to
improve performance. Unfortunately, existing methods for estimating the
variance of the {\lambda}-return are complex and not well understood
empirically. We contribute a method for estimating the variance of the
{\lambda}-return directly using policy evaluation methods from reinforcement
learning. Our approach is significantly simpler than prior methods that
independently estimate the second moment of the {\lambda}-return. Empirically
our new approach behaves at least as well as existing approaches, but is
generally more robust.

under what conditions we can find the correct MB of a target variable, and (b)
under what conditions we can identify the causes of the target variable via

contrast with the most widely used MTL CNN structures which empirically or
heuristically share features on some specific layers (e.g., share all the
features except the last convolutional layer). The proposed layerwise feature
fusing scheme is formulated by combining existing CNN components in a novel
way, with clear mathematical interpretability as discriminative dimensionality
reduction, which is referred to as Neural Discriminative Dimensionality
Reduction (NDDR). Specifically, we first concatenate features with the same
spatial resolution from different tasks according to their channel dimension.
Then, we show that the discriminative dimensionality reduction can be fulfilled
by 1x1 Convolution, Batch Normalization, and Weight Decay in one CNN. The use
of existing CNN components ensures the end-to-end training and the
extensibility of the proposed NDDR layer to various state-of-the-art CNN
architectures in a ""plug-and-play"" manner. The detailed ablation analysis shows
that the proposed NDDR layer is easy to train and also robust to different
hyperparameters. Experiments on different task sets with various base network
architectures demonstrate the promising performance and desirable
generalizability of our proposed method. The code of our paper is available at

Moreover, CLA can jointly consider the relationship of feature classes and the
relevance of the semantic classes for improving zero-shot classification. The
CLA solution can provide both unseen class labels and the relation of the

and $H$ are heavier than 130 GeV. We find that the DM with a mass of $10\sim

Next, we consider a special scenario in which the heavy CP-even Higgs is taken
as the 125 GeV Higgs. The light CP-even Higgs is the only portal between the DM

the signal data of the 125 GeV Higgs restrict $\tan\beta$ to be in the range of

ASASSN-15no, based on optical data covering ~300 days of its evolution.
Initially the spectra show a pure blackbody continuum. After few days, the HeI
5876 A transition appears with a P-Cygni profile and an expansion velocity of
about 8700 km/s. Fifty days after maximum, the spectrum shows signs typically
seen in interacting supernovae. A broad (FWHM~8000 km/s) Halpha becomes more
prominent with time until ~150 days after maximum and quickly declines later
on. At these phases Halpha starts to show an intermediate component, which
together with the blue pseudo-continuum are clues that the ejecta begin to
interact with the CSM. The spectra at the latest phases look very similar to
the nebular spectra of stripped-envelope SNe. The early part (the first 40 days
after maximum) of the bolometric curve, which peaks at a luminosity
intermediate between normal and superluminous supernovae, is well reproduced by
a model in which the energy budget is essentially coming from ejecta
recombination and 56Ni decay. From the model we infer a mass of the ejecta Mej
= 2.6 Msun; an initial radius of the photosphere R0 = 2.1 x 10^14 cm; and an
explosion energy Eexpl = 0.8 x 10^51 erg. A possible scenario involves a
massive and extended H-poor shell lost by the progenitor star a few years
before explosion. The shell is hit, heated and accelerated by the supernova
ejecta. The accelerated shell+ejecta rapidly dilutes, unveiling the unperturbed
supernova spectrum below. The outer ejecta start to interact with a H-poor
external CSM lost by the progenitor system about 9 -- 90 years before the

anonymity and ensure accountability of users. It allows group members to
anonymously sign messages on behalf of the whole group, while incorporating a
tracing mechanism to identify the signer of any suspected signature. Most of
the existing group signature schemes, however, do not guarantee security once
secret keys are exposed. To reduce potential damages caused by key exposure
attacks, Song (ACMCCS 2001) put forward the concept of forward-secure group
signature (FSGS), which prevents attackers from forging group signatures
pertaining to past time periods even if a secret group signing key is revealed
at the current time period. For the time being, however, all known secure FSGS
schemes are based on number-theoretic assumptions, and are vulnerable against
quantum computers.
  In this work, we construct the first lattice-based FSGS scheme. Our scheme is
proven secure under the Short Integer Solution and Learning With Errors
assumptions. At the heart of our construction is a scalable lattice-based key
evolving mechanism, allowing users to periodically update their secret keys and
to efficiently prove in zero-knowledge that key evolution process is done
correctly. To realize this essential building block, we first employ the Bonsai

waves and its possible role in heating coronal loops through the strong and
localized gradients they generate on the wave. Methods: An analytic model is
built for the transition between a sausage and a kink wave modes propagating
along field lines in the corona. We compute in this model the local
frequencies, the wave gradients and the associated heating rates due to
compressive viscosity. Results: We find superoscillations associated with the
transition between wave modes accompanying the wave dislocation that shifts
through the wave domain. Frequencies 10 times higher than the normal frequency
are found. This means that a typical 3-minute coronal wave will locally
oscillate in 10 to 20 seconds. Such high frequencies bring up strong gradients
that efficiently dissipate the wave through compressive viscosity. We compute
the associated heating rates. Locally, they are very strong, largely
compensating typical radiative losses.
  Conclusions: We find a new heating mechanism associated to magnetoacoustic
waves in the corona. Heating due to superoscillations only happens along
particular field lines with small cross sections, comparable in size to coronal
loops, inside the much larger magnetic flux tubes and wave propagation domain.

the sensitivity of Euclid and SKA to the parameters of the standard

combined with Planck, assuming a plain cosmological constant, our method gives
robust predictions for a high sensitivity to the primordial spectral index
$n_{\rm s}$ ($\sigma(n_s)=0.00085$), the Hubble constant $H_0$
($\sigma(H_0)=0.141 \, {\rm km/s/Mpc}$), the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$
($\sigma(M_\nu)=0.020 \, {\rm eV}$). Assuming dynamical dark energy we get
$\sigma(M_\nu)=0.030 \, {\rm eV}$ for the mass and $(\sigma(w_0), \sigma(w_a))
= (0.0214, 0.071)$ for the equation of state parameters. The predicted
sensitivity to $M_\nu$ is mostly stable against the extensions of the
cosmological model considered here. Interestingly, a significant improvement of
the constraints on the extended model parameters is also obtained when
combining Euclid with a low redshift HI intensity mapping survey by SKA1,
demonstrating the importance of the synergy of Euclid and SKA.

formation epoch of this cluster, and compare them to those of the Coma cluster,
which is comparable in mass to Ophiuchus but much more disturbed dynamically.
Based on a deep image of the Ophiuchus cluster in the r' band obtained at the
Canada France Hawaii Telescope with the MegaCam camera, we have applied an
iterative process to subtract the contribution of the numerous stars that
pollute the image, due to the low Galactic latitude of the cluster, and
obtained a photometric catalogue of 2818 galaxies fully complete at r'=20.5 mag
and still 91% complete at r'=21.5 mag. We use this catalogue to derive the
cluster Galaxy Luminosity Function (GLF) for the overall image and for a region
(hereafter the ""rectangle"" region) covering exactly the same physical size as
the region in which the GLF of the Coma cluster was studied by Adami et al.
(2007). We then compute density maps based on an adaptive kernel technique, for
different magnitude limits, and define three circular regions covering 0.08,
0.08 and 0.06 deg^2 respectively centered on the cluster (C), northwest (NW)
and southeast (SE) of the cluster, in which we compute the GLFs. The GLF fits
are much better when a Gaussian is added to the usual Schechter function, to
account for the excess of very bright galaxies. Compared to Coma, Ophiuchus
shows a strong excess of bright galaxies. The properties of the two nearby very
massive clusters Ophiuchus and Coma are quite comparable, though they seem
embedded in different large scale environments. Our interpretation is that
Ophiuchus has built up long ago, as confirmed by its relaxed state (see paper
I) while Coma is still in the process of forming.

However, due to data sparsity, these models often fall back to very small

over generalized representations such as POS tags or word clusters. In this

concretely we train neuralized versions of lexicalized reordering and the

operations, this allows us to also train a sequence-to-sequence neural MT model
having explicit reordering triggers. Our motivation was to directly enable
reordering information in the encoder-decoder framework, which otherwise relies
solely on the attention model to handle long range reordering. We tried both
coarser and fine-grained reordering operations. However, these experiments did

the theory of the strong interaction to analyze its phase structure at finite
temperature and quark chemical potential. In particular at low temperature and
large chemical potential, where the application of fully first-principles
approaches is currently difficult at best, this class of models still plays a
prominent role to guide our understanding of the dynamics of dense
strong-interaction matter. In this work, we consider a Fierz-complete version
of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with two massless quark flavors and study its
renormalization group flow and fixed-point structure at leading order of the
derivative expansion of the effective action. Sum rules for the various
four-quark couplings then allow us to monitor the strength of the breaking of
the axial $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry close to and above the phase boundary. We
find that the dynamics in the ten-dimensional Fierz-complete space of
four-quark couplings can only be reduced to a one-dimensional space associated
with the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling in the strict large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit.
Still, the interacting fixed point associated with this one-dimensional
subspace appears to govern the dynamics at small quark chemical potential even
beyond the large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit. At large chemical potential, corrections
beyond the large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit become important and the dynamics is
dominated by diquarks, favoring the formation of a chirally symmetric diquark
condensate. In this regime, our study suggests that the phase boundary is
shifted to higher temperatures when a Fierz-complete set of four-quark
interactions is considered.

provide high data throughput in next generation cellular networks. By equipping
the base stations (BSs) with tens or hundreds of antenna elements, narrow and
high gain beams can be used to spatially multiplex several user equipment (UE)
devices. While increasing the achievable performance, focusing the transmit
power into specific UE directions also poses new issues when performing the
radio frequency (RF) exposure assessment. In fact, the spatial distribution of
the actual BS transmit power strongly depends on the deployment scenario and on
the position of the UEs. Traditional methods for assessing the RF exposure
compliance boundaries around BS sites are generally based on maximum transmit
power and static beams. In massive MIMO systems, these approaches tend to be
very conservative, in particular when time averaging is properly considered. In
this work, we propose to leverage the three dimensional spatial channel model
standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project in order to assess
reasonably foreseeable compliance boundaries of massive MIMO BSs. The analysis
is performed by considering BSs fully loaded and different configurations of
active UEs per cell. Numerical results show that the statistical approach
developed in this paper allows reducing to nearly half the compliance distance
when compared to the traditional method.

symmetric self--gravitating systems, based on a quantity, hereafter referred to
as complexity factor, that appears in the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann
tensor, in the context of general relativity. We start by assuming that the
homogeneous (in the energy density) fluid, with isotropic pressure is endowed
with minimal complexity. For this kind of fluid distribution, the value of
complexity factor is zero. So, the rationale behind our proposal for the
definition of complexity factor stems from the fact that it measures the
departure, in the value of the active gravitational mass (Tolman mass), with
respect to its value for a zero complexity system. Such departure is produced
by a specific combination of energy density inhomogeneity and pressure
anisotropy. Thus, zero complexity factor may also be found in self--gravitating
systems with inhomogeneous energy density and anisotropic pressure, provided
the effects of these two factors, on the complexity factor, cancel each other.
Some exact interior solutions to the Einstein equations satisfying the zero
complexity criterium are found, and prospective applications of this newly
defined concept, to the study of the structure and evolution of compact
objects, are discussed.

performance in supervised hash function learning. In this paper, we propose a
novel asymmetric supervised deep hashing method to preserve the semantic
structure among different categories and generate the binary codes
simultaneously. Specifically, two asymmetric deep networks are constructed to
reveal the similarity between each pair of images according to their semantic
labels. The deep hash functions are then learned through two networks by
minimizing the gap between the learned features and discrete codes.
Furthermore, since the binary codes in the Hamming space also should keep the
semantic affinity existing in the original space, another asymmetric pairwise
loss is introduced to capture the similarity between the binary codes and
real-value features. This asymmetric loss not only improves the retrieval
performance, but also contributes to a quick convergence at the training phase.
By taking advantage of the two-stream deep structures and two types of
asymmetric pairwise functions, an alternating algorithm is designed to optimize
the deep features and high-quality binary codes efficiently. Experimental
results on three real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach as compared with state-of-the-art.

for many tasks, but capturing large scenes can take significant time, and the
risk of transient changes to the scene goes up as the capture time increases.
These are good reasons to want instead to capture several smaller sub-scenes
that can be joined to make the whole scene. Achieving this has traditionally
been difficult: joining sub-scenes that may never have been viewed from the
same angle requires a high-quality camera relocaliser that can cope with novel
poses, and tracking drift in each sub-scene can prevent them from being joined
to make a consistent overall scene. Recent advances, however, have
significantly improved our ability to capture medium-sized sub-scenes with
little to no tracking drift: real-time globally consistent reconstruction
systems can close loops and re-integrate the scene surface on the fly, whilst
new visual-inertial odometry approaches can significantly reduce tracking drift
during live reconstruction. Moreover, high-quality regression forest-based
relocalisers have recently been made more practical by the introduction of a
method to allow them to be trained and used online. In this paper, we leverage
these advances to present what to our knowledge is the first system to allow
multiple users to collaborate interactively to reconstruct dense, voxel-based

traditionally been both time-consuming and dependent on the availability of
specialised hardware. Using our system, an entire house or lab can be

consequences: first, in order to obtain constant power to reject one model in

null at a slower rate than the usual parametric $n^{-1/2}$ (typically we will
require $n^{-1/4}$ or slower); in other words, to distinguish between the

that under even weaker conditions on their tangent cones, models in these
classes cannot be made simultaneously convex by a reparameterization.
  This shows that Bayesian network models, amongst others, cannot be learned
directly with a convex method similar to the graphical lasso. However, we are
able to use our results to suggest methods for model selection that learn the
tangent space directly, rather than the model itself. In particular, we give a
generic algorithm for learning Bayesian network models.

and enjoys a long and distinguished history. The classical paradigm assumes a
distinguished initial state, comprised of a set of facts, and is defined over a
set of actions which change that state in one way or another. Planning in many
real-world settings, however, is much more involved: an agent's knowledge is
almost never simply a set of facts that are true, and actions that the agent
intends to execute never operate the way they are supposed to. Thus,
probabilistic planning attempts to incorporate stochastic models directly into
the planning process. In this article, we briefly report on probabilistic
planning through the lens of probabilistic programming: a programming paradigm
that aims to ease the specification of structured probability distributions. In
particular, we provide an overview of the features of two systems, HYPE and
ALLEGRO, which emphasise different strengths of probabilistic programming that
are particularly useful for complex modelling issues raised in probabilistic
planning. Among other things, with these systems, one can instantiate planning
problems with growing and shrinking state spaces, discrete and continuous
probability distributions, and non-unique prior distributions in a first-order
setting.

level they are written in terms of a set of ODEs with a nonlinearity that is
typically a sigmoidal shape. Using structural data from brain atlases they may
be connected into a network to investigate the emergence of functional dynamic
states, such as synchrony. With the simple restriction of the classic sigmoidal
nonlinearity to a piecewise linear caricature we show that the famous
Wilson-Cowan neural mass model can be analysed at both the node and network
level. The construction of periodic orbits at the node level is achieved by
patching together matrix exponential solutions, and stability is determined
using Floquet theory. For networks with interactions described by circulant
matrices, we show that the stability of the synchronous state can be determined
in terms of a low-dimensional Floquet problem parameterised by the eigenvalues
of the interaction matrix. This network Floquet problem is readily solved using
linear algebra, to predict the onset of spatio-temporal network patterns
arising from a synchronous instability. We consider the case of a discontinuous
choice for the node nonlinearity, namely the replacement of the sigmoid by a
Heaviside nonlinearity. This gives rise to a continuous-time switching network.
At the node level this allows for the existence of unstable sliding periodic
orbits, which we construct. The stability of a periodic orbit is now treated
with a modification of Floquet theory to treat the evolution of small
perturbations through switching manifolds via saltation matrices. At the
network level the stability analysis of the synchronous state is considerably
more challenging. Here we report on the use of ideas originally developed for
the study of Glass networks to treat the stability of periodic network states
in neural mass models with discontinuous interactions.

consisting of continuum images, line-of-sight/vector magnetograms, and 1600
{\AA} UV images. These data were acquired with the SDO HMI and AIA. The
white-light flare emission differed for both flares, while the X2.2 flare
displayed localized, confined flare kernels, the X9.3 flare exhibited a
two-ribbon structure. In contrast, the excess UV emission exhibited a similar
structure for both flares, but with larger areal extent for the X9.3 flare.
These two flares represented a scenario, where the first confined flare acted
as precursor, setting up the stage for the more extended flare. Difference maps
for continuum and magnetograms revealed locations of significant changes, i.e.,
penumbral decay and umbral strengthening. The curved magnetic polarity
inversion line in the {\delta}-spot was the fulcrum of most changes. Horizontal
proper motions were computed using the DAVE4VM. Persistent flow features
included (1) strong shear flows along the polarity inversion line, where the
negative, parasitic polarity tried to bypass the majority, positive-polarity
part of the {\delta}-spot in the north, (2) a group of positive-polarity spots,
which moved around the {\delta}-spot in the south, moving away from the
{\delta}-spot with significant horizontal flow speeds, and (3) intense moat
flows partially surrounding the penumbra of several sunspots, which became
weaker in regions with penumbral decay. The enhanced flare activity has its
origin in the head-on collision of newly emerging flux with an already existing
regular, {\alpha}-spot.

instrument. In most stars, including the Sun, surface convection provides the
excitation mechanism (Goldreich and Keeley, 1977). With turbulent velocities
reaching speeds comparable to the local sound speed near the surface of the
star, the vigorous convective motions can excite standing acoustic waves. These
are known as pressure or p modes because the restoring force arises from the
pressure gradient. The broad frequency spectrum of this excitation mechanism
gives rise to many oscillation modes, both radial and non-radial, excited
simultaneously. These stochastically excited and intrinsically damped
oscillations were first detected in the Sun (Leighton et al., 1962), and hence
are commonly known as solar-like oscillations. When stars grow old and the
supply of hydrogen fuel is exhausted in the core, their envelopes expand and
cool: they become subgiants and eventually red giants. Like the Sun, low-mass
red giants have convective outer envelopes but the much longer convective time
scales drives oscillation modes at much lower frequencies. The expansion and
contraction of different parts of the stellar surface when a star oscillates
gives rise to variations in temperature -- and hence also luminosity -- across
the stellar surface. In this chapter asteroseismology of low-mas (M<3M_Sun) is

problems, including the computation of (persistent) homology. In this context,
discrete Morse theory is used to reduce the problem of computing a topological
invariant of an input simplicial complex to computing the same topological
invariant of a (significantly smaller) collapsed cell or chain complex.
Consequently, devising methods for obtaining gradient vector fields on
complexes to reduce the size of the problem instance has become an emerging
theme over the last decade. While computing the optimal gradient vector field
on a simplicial complex is NP-hard, several heuristics have been observed to
compute near-optimal gradient vector fields on a wide variety of datasets.
Understanding the theoretical limits of these strategies is therefore a
fundamental problem in computational topology. In this paper, we consider the
approximability of maximization and minimization variants of the Morse matching
problem, posed as open problems by Joswig and Pfetsch. We establish hardness
results for Max-Morse matching and Min-Morse matching. In particular, we show
that, for a simplicial complex with n simplices and dimension $d \leq 3$, it is
NP-hard to approximate Min-Morse matching within a factor of
$O(n^{1-\epsilon})$, for any $\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, using an L-reduction
from Degree 3 Max-Acyclic Subgraph to Max-Morse matching, we show that it is
both NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate Max-Morse matching for simplicial
complexes of dimension $d \leq 2$ within certain explicit constant factors.

show that to make this relativistic invariance of ${\cal M}$ to work, we have
to modify the QED interaction Hamiltonian. Using this modification, we
calculate the scattering amplitude for QED processes, Compton scattering and
M{\o}ller Scattering. This gives an additional factor of $\frac{\bf P}{P_0}$ in
Feynman amplitude, where $P$ is sum of four momentum of incoming particles (or
outgoing) and ${\bf P} = \sqrt{P^2}$. In this paper taking vacuum polarization
as a example, we show that we can avoid divergences in QED if we correctly work
with this factor $\frac{\bf P}{P_0}$.

polarized light leads to a strong forward/backward asymmetry in the
photoelectron angular distribution. This chiroptical effect, referred to as
Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD), was shown to take place in all
ionization regimes, from single photon to tunnel ionization. In the Resonance
Enhanced Multiphoton Ionisation (REMPI) regime, where most of the table-top
PECD experiments have been performed, understanding the role of the
intermediate resonances is currently the subject of experimental and
theoretical investigations. In an attempt to decouple the role of bound-bound
and bound-continuum transitions in REMPI-PECD, we photoionized the (+)-limonene
enantiomer using two-color laser fields in [1+1'] and [2+2'] ionization
schemes, where the polarization state of each color can be controlled
independently. We demonstrate that the main effect of the bound-bound
transition is to break the sample isotropy by orientation-dependent
photoexcitation, in agreement with recent theoretical pre- dictions. We show
that the angular distribution of PECD strongly depends on the anisotropy of
photoexcitation to the intermediate state, which is different for circularly
and linearly polarized laser pulses. On the contrary, the helicity of the pulse
that drives the bound-bound transition is shown to have a negligible effect on
the PECD.

phase at a similar rate for two orders of magnitude in magnetic flux, a rate
comparable to that observed in large active regions containing an order of
magnitude more flux. During the late decay phase, the rate of change was
significantly faster than what is observed in large, decaying active regions.
Our results suggest that the rate of increase during the emergence/early decay
phase is linked to the fractionation mechanism leading to the FIP effect,
whereas the rate of decrease during the later decay phase depends on the rate
of reconnection with the surrounding magnetic field and its plasma composition.

Here we show that, in the superconducting quantum circuit context, polariton

simulate a spin-1/2 system, based on which tunable synthetic spin-orbit

effective Zeeman field of the polariton can both be tuned by modulating the
coupling strength between neighbouring resonators, allowing for the realization
of a large variety of polaritonic topological semimetal bands. Methods for
detecting the polaritonic topological edge states and topological invariants
are also proposed. Therefore, our work suggests that the JC lattice is a
versatile platform for exploring spinful topological states of matter, which
may inspire developments of topologically protected quantum optical and

surrounded by an equatorial distribution of dusty material that are, in a
number of cases, spatially unresolved even with cutting edge facilities. Aims.
In this paper, we investigate if and how one can determine the unresolved and
heterogeneous morphology of dust distribution around a central bright source
using time-resolved polarimetric observations. Methods. We use polarized
radiative transfer simulations to study a sample of circumnuclear dusty
morphologies. We explore a grid of uniform, fragmented, density-stratified,
geometrically-variable models in the near-infrared, optical and ultraviolet
bands, and present their distinctive time-dependent polarimetric signatures.
Results. As expected, varying the structure of the obscuring equatorial disk
has a deep impact on the inclination-dependent flux, polarization degree and
angle, and time-lags we observe. We find that stratified media are
distinguishable by time-resolved polarimetric observations, and that the
expected polarization is much higher in the infrared band than in the
ultraviolet. However, due to the physical scales imposed by dust sublimation,
the average time-lags between the total and polarized fluxes are important
(months to years), lengthening the observational campaigns necessary to break
more sophisticated (and therefore also more degenerated) models. In the
ultraviolet band, time-lags are slightly shorter than in the infrared or
optical bands, and, coupled to lower diluting starlight fluxes, time-resolved
polarimetry in the UV appears more promising for future campaigns.

continues to be a ubiquitous problem spanning all disciplines. Various tools
have been developed to assist human inspectors by automatically identifying
suspicious documents. However, to our knowledge currently none of these tools
use mathematical content for their analysis. This is problematic, because
mathematical content potentially represents a significant amount of the
scientific contribution in academic documents. Hence, ignoring mathematical
content limits the detection of plagiarism considerably, especially in
disciplines with frequent use of mathematics.
  This paper aims to help close this gap by providing an overview of existing
approaches in mathematical information retrieval and an analysis of their
applicability for different possible cases of mathematical plagiarism. I find
that whereas syntax-based approaches perform particularly well in detecting
undisguised plagiarism, structure-based and hybrid approaches promise to also
detect forms of disguised mathematical plagiarism, such as plagiarism with
renamed identifiers. However, more research in this area is needed to enable
the detection of more complex mathematical plagiarism: the scope of current
approaches is restricted to the formula-level, an extension to the
section-level is needed. Additionally, the general detection of equivalence
transformations is currently not feasible. Despite these remaining problems, I
conclude that the presented approaches could already be used for a basic
automated detection system targeting mathematical plagiarism and therefore
enhance current plagiarism detection systems.

constantcomposition distribution matching (CCDM), all output sequences have
identical composition. In this paper, we propose multisetpartition distribution
matching (MPDM) where the composition is constant over all output sequences.
When considering the desired distribution as a multiset, MPDM corresponds to
partitioning this multiset into equal-size subsets. We show that MPDM allows to
address more output sequences and thus has lower rate loss than CCDM in all
nontrivial cases. By imposing some constraints on the partitioning, a
constructive MPDM algorithm is proposed which comprises two parts. A
variable-length prefix of the binary data word determines the composition to be
used, and the remainder of the input word is mapped with a conventional CCDM
algorithm, such as arithmetic coding, according to the chosen composition.
Simulations of 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation over the additive white

all cells in this tissue. Digital tissue deconvolution (DTD) addresses the
following inverse problem: Given the expression profile $y$ of a tissue, what
is the cellular composition $c$ of that tissue? If $X$ is a matrix whose
columns are reference profiles of individual cell types, the composition $c$
can be computed by minimizing $\mathcal L(y-Xc)$ for a given loss function
$\mathcal L$. Current methods use predefined all-purpose loss functions. They
successfully quantify the dominating cells of a tissue, while often falling
short in detecting small cell populations.
  Here we learn the loss function $\mathcal L$ along with the composition $c$.
This allows us to adapt to application-specific requirements such as focusing
on small cell populations or distinguishing phenotypically similar cell
populations. Our method quantifies large cell fractions as accurately as
existing methods and significantly improves the detection of small cell
populations and the distinction of similar cell types.

from theoretical, computational, and application perspectives across the fields

permanently changed through torques from transient spiral patterns.
Interactions at the corotation resonance dominate these changes and have the
further property of conserving orbital circularity. We derived in an earlier
paper an analytic criterion that an unperturbed stellar orbit must satisfy in
order for such an interaction to occur i.e. for it to be in a trapped orbit
around corotation. We here use this criterion in an investigation of how the
efficiency of induced radial migration for a population of disc stars varies
with the angular momentum distribution of that population. We frame our results
in terms of the velocity dispersion of the population, this being an easier
observable than is the angular momentum distribution. Specifically, we
investigate how the fraction of stars in trapped orbits at corotation varies
with the velocity dispersion of the population, for a system with an assumed
flat rotation curve. Our analytic results agree with the finding from
simulations that radial migration is less effective in populations with
'hotter' kinematics. We further quantify the dependence of this trapped
fraction on the strength of the spiral pattern, finding a higher trapped
fraction for higher amplitude perturbations.

The oscillations are antiphase with the quantum oscillating electronic density

that all the conventional heat-transport mechanisms through diffusions of

$\mathcal{O}_{Z,\xi}$ has a $p$-basis over $\mathcal{O}_{Z,\xi}^p$. Here we
show that, for every $\xi \in Z$, there exists an open affine neighborhood of

over $A^p$.
  This passage from the local ring to an affine neighborhood of $\xi$ has
geometrical consequences, some of which will be discussed in the second part of

over $A^p$, there is a family of differential operators on $A$ naturally
associated to $\mathcal{B}$. These differential operators will enable us to
give a Jacobian criterion for regularity for varieties defined over $k$, as

fields and bent functions by extending the notion of linear translators,
introduced by Kyureghyan [12]. We call these translators Frobenius translators
since the derivatives of $f : F_{p^n} \rightarrow F_{p^k}$, where $n = rk$, are
of the form $f(x + u\phi) - f(x) = u^{p^i}b$, for a fixed $b \in F_{p^k}$ and
all $u \in F_{p^k}$, rather than considering the standard case corresponding to
$i = 0$. This considerably extends a rather rare family {f} admitting linear
translators of the above form. Furthermore, we solve a few open problems in the
recent article [4] concerning the existence and an exact specification of $f$
admitting classical linear translators, and an open problem introduced in [9]
of finding a triple of bent functions $f_1, f_2, f_3$ such that their sum $f_4$
is bent and that the sum of their duals $f_1* +f_2* +f_3* +f_4* = 1$. Finally,
we also specify two huge families of permutations over $F_{p^n}$ related to the
condition that $G(y) = -L(y)+(y+\delta)^s -(y+\delta)^{p^ks}$ permutes the set
$S =\{\beta \in F_{p^n} : Tr^n_k(\beta) = 0\}$, where $n = 2k$ and $p > 2$.
Finally, we offer generalizations of constructions of bent functions from [16]

effectively recognized by ASR through the air, in the presence of background
noise, while not being detected by a human listener. Our research shows that
this can be done automatically against real world ASR applications. We also

have been achieved for the three-dimensional compressible flow computations
[33]. The high-order accuracy of the scheme is obtained directly by integrating
a multidimensional time-accurate gas distribution function over the cell
interface within a time step without implementing Gaussian quadrature points
and Runge-Kutta time-stepping technique. However, for the further increasing
the order of the scheme, such as the fourth-order one, the formulation becomes
very complicated for the multidimensional flow. Recently, a two-stage
fourth-order GKS with high efficiency has been constructed for two-dimensional
inviscid and viscous flow computations [22,32], and the scheme uses the time
accurate flux function and its time derivatives. In this paper, a fourth-order
GKS is developed for the threedimensional flows under the two-stage framework.
Based on the three-dimensional WENO reconstruction and flux evaluation at
Gaussian quadrature points on a cell interface, the high-order accuracy in
space is achieved first. Then, the two-stage time stepping method provides the
high accuracy in time. In comparison with the formal third-order GKS [33], the
current fourth-order method not only improves the accuracy of the scheme, but
also reduces the complexity of the gas-kinetic solver greatly. More
importantly, the fourth-order GKS has the same robustness as the second-order
shock capturing scheme. This scheme is applied to both inviscid and viscous,
and low and high speed flow computations. Numerical results validate the
outstanding reliability and applicability of the scheme for three-dimensional
flows, such as turbulent one.

series of artificial fractal surfaces with ideal dimension (Di) values ranging
from 2.1 to 2.9 were generated through Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) function,
in order to compare SRP method with traditional methods such as box counting
method and power spectral density method. The calculated dimension (Dc) by SRP
method was much closer to Di than the other methods, with a mean relative error
of only 0.64%. Secondly, SRP method was utilized to deal with real surfaces,

the expansion is a phenomenological representation of a quantum transition from
a Planck-scale initial state into a final virtual photonic state of energy
$W\simeq \hbar c/2r_e$ and lifetime $\simeq r_e/c$, occupying a volume $\simeq

$\rho_G$, of this virtual state is found to be within $\sim 10\%$ of the

proposed that this is not merely an ""accidental"" numerical coincidence but has
physical significance, namely that the sum of the two energy densities is zero,
i.e. $\rho_\Lambda+\rho_G=0$. This relation gives a value of the cosmological
constant, $\Lambda$, in agreement with astronomical measurements. The
implications of these inter-relations between $\Lambda$, the gravitational

total energy tensor is the sum of the energy tensor of the medium producing the
electromagnetic (e.m.) field and the e.m. energy tensor. This means that an
additional, ""interaction"" tensor has to be present. With this assumption, the
standard Maxwell equations in a curved spacetime, which predict charge
conservation, are compatible with the investigated theory. We find that the

are compared with previous approximate results which were obtained using SiO-He
PESs or scaled from SiO-He rate coefficients. Rovibrational state-to-state and
total quenching cross sections and rate coefficients for initially excited
SiO($v_1=1, j_1$=0 and 1) in collisions with para-H$_2$($v_2=0,j_2=0$) and
ortho-H$_2$($v_2=0,j_2=1$) were also obtained. The application of the current
collisional rate coefficients to astrophysics is briefly discussed.

Thus, we need automatic methods to label software code. Software code can be
labeled with a set of keywords. These keywords in this paper referred as
software labels. The goal of this paper is to provide a quick view of the
software code vocabulary. This paper proposes an automatic approach to document
the object-oriented software by labeling its code. The approach exploits all
software identifiers to label software code. The paper presents the results of
study conducted on the ArgoUML and drawing shapes case studies. Results showed
that all code labels were correctly identified.

semi-classical analog of the anomaly-induced chiral magnetic effect. The
helical solitonic excitations on vortices in a parity-breaking medium are found
to carry an additional energy flow along the vortex in the direction dictated
by the sign of chirality imbalance; we call this new transport phenomenon the
Chiral Propulsion Effect (CPE). The dynamics of the filament is described by a
modified version of the localized induction equation in the parity-breaking
background. We analyze the linear stability of simple vortex configurations,
and study the effects of chiral media on the excitation spectrum and the growth
rate of the unstable modes. It is also shown that, if the equation of motion of
the filament is symmetric under the simultaneous reversal of parity and time,
the resulting planar solution cannot transport energy.

  update","14 pages, 5 figures and 7 tables",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi- or many-objective evolutionary algorithm- s(MOEAs), especially the
decomposition-based MOEAs have been widely concerned in recent years. The
decomposition-based MOEAs emphasize convergence and diversity in a simple model
and have made a great success in dealing with theoretical and practical multi-
or many-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we focus on update
strategies of the decomposition- based MOEAs, and their criteria for comparing
solutions. Three disadvantages of the decomposition-based MOEAs with local
update strategies and several existing criteria for comparing solutions are
analyzed and discussed. And a global loop update strategy and two hybrid
criteria are suggested. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm with the global
loop update is implement- ed and compared to several of the best multi- or
many-objective optimization algorithms on two famous unconstraint test suites
with up to 15 objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that unlike
evolutionary algorithms with local update strategies, the population of our
algorithm does not degenerate at any generation of its evolution, which
guarantees the diversity of the resulting population. In addition, our
algorithm wins in most instances of the two test suites, indicating that it is
very compet- itive in terms of convergence and diversity. Running results of
our algorithm with different criteria for comparing solutions are also
compared. Their differences are very significant, indicating that the
performance of our algorithm is affected by the criterion it adopts.
