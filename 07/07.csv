simplify the otherwise rather intractable equations governing their morphology

axisymmetry and a self-similar form for all variables: in spherical coordinates
$(r,\theta,\phi)$, the magnetic field and plasma velocity are taken to be of
the form: ${\bf B}={\bf f}(\theta)/r^n$ and
  ${\bf v}={\bf g}(\theta)/r^m$, with corresponding expressions for the scalar
variables like pressure and density. Solutions are obtained for potential,
force-free, and non-force-free magnetic configurations. Potential-field
solutions can be found for all values of~$n$. Non-potential force-free
solutions possess an azimuthal component $B_\phi$ and exist only for $n\ge2$;
the resulting structures are twisted and have closed field lines but are not
collimated around the system axis. In the non-force free case, including gas
pressure, the magnetic field lines acquire an additional curvature to
compensate for an outward pointing pressure gradient force. We have also
considered a pure rotation situation with no gravity, in the zero-$\beta$
limit: the solution has cylindrical geometry and twisted magnetic field lines.
The latter solutions can be helpful in producing a collimated magnetic field
structure; but they exist only when $n<0$ and $m<0$: for applications they must
be matched to an external system at a finite distance from the origin.

they are nearly singular integrals. The method we propose is based on writing
these layer potentials in spherical coordinates where the point at which their

rule is used for integration with respect to the the polar angle rather than
the cosine of the polar angle. A 2N-point periodic trapezoid rule is used to

natural and effective averaging operation in this coordinate system. The
numerical method resulting from combining these two quadrature rules in this
rotated coordinate system yields results that are consistent with asymptotic
behaviors of the double- and single-layer potentials at close evaluation
distances. In particular, we show that the error in computing the double-layer
potential, after applying a subtraction method, is quadratic with respect to
the evaluation distance from the boundary, and the error is linear for the
single-layer potential. We improve upon the single-layer potential by
introducing an alternate approximation based on a perturbation expansion and

a family of filters of vanishing scale. On the other hand, when applied to the

observable which is the half-parity observable itself. Based on a
quantum-trajectory approach, we theoretically analyze the statistics of
energetic fluctuations for a pair of continuously monitored qubits. We
quantitatively relate these energetic fluctuations to the rate of entanglement
produced between the qubits, and build an energetic-based estimator to assess
the presence of entanglement in the circuit. Remarkably, this estimator is
valid at the single-trajectory level and shows to be robust against finite
detection efficiency. Our work paves the road towards a fundamental
understanding of the stochastic energetic processes associated with

can effectively be used for MIL problems as illustrated by better performance
on the standard benchmark datasets comparing to the state-of-the-art

While a lot of efforts have focused on the CO2 effects on the long-term trends,

two-dimensional cylinder spacetime as it responds to the time-dependent
evolution of a Mamev-Trunov potential of the form $V(x,t) = 2 \xi \delta(x)
\theta(-t)$. We begin by constructing mode solutions to the classical
Klein-Gordon-Fock equation with potential on the whole spacetime. For a given
eigen-mode solution of the IN region of the spacetime ($t<0$), we determine its
evolution into the OUT region ($t>0$) through the use of a Fourier
decomposition in terms of the OUT region eigen-modes. The classical system is
then second quantized in the canonical quantization scheme. On the OUT region,
there is a unitarily equivalent representation of the quantized field in terms
of the OUT region eigen-modes, including zero-frequency modes which we also
quantize in a manner which allows for their interpretation as particles in the
typical sense. After determining the Bogolubov coefficients between the two
representations, we study the production of quanta out of the vacuum when the
potential turns off. We find that the number of ""particles"" created on the OUT
region is finite for the standard modes, and with the usual ambiguity in the
number of particles created in the zero frequency modes. We then look at the
renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy-tensor on the IN and OUT
regions for the IN vacuum state. We find that the resulting stress-tensor can
violate the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions because the
standard Casimir energy-density of the cylinder spacetime is negative. Finally,
we show that the same stress-tensor satisfies a quantum inequality on the OUT

limitations. (1) They do not account for economic considerations of a user in
buying/adopting items. (2) Most studies on multiple items focus on competition,

the weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM), which estimate the underlying
low-rank matrix directly from the corrupted observations, we progressively
approximate the underlying low-rank matrix via minimizing the rank residual.
Through integrating the image nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior with the
proposed RRC model, we apply it to image restoration tasks, including image
denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Towards this end, we first
obtain a good reference of the original image groups by using the image NSS
prior, and then the rank residual of the image groups between this reference
and the degraded image is minimized to achieve a better estimate to the desired
image. In this manner, both the reference and the estimated image are updated
gradually and jointly in each iteration. Based on the group-based sparse
representation model, we further provide a theoretical analysis on the
feasibility of the proposed RRC model. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed RRC model outperforms many state-of-the-art schemes in both the

relativistic beaming with Doppler boosting factors ranging from 1.7 to 6. The
brightness temperatures of the other ten are below the equilibrium limit. Jet
proper motions are determined in two sources which have multiple epoch data,

flux density variation is found in J0943+3614 over a time period of 10 years.
No significant variability are detected in three other sources over time scales

resemble GHz-peaked spectrum or compact steep-spectrum sources. Moreover, the
diversity of their relativistic beaming indicators (brightness temperature,

experiments of undercooled melts under non-equilibrium conditions, which is
directly accessible to observation. We applied the electrostatic levitation
technique in order to study the crystal growth velocity $v$ as a function of
the undercooling $\Delta T$ for the intermetallic, congruently melting binary
alloy NiTi and the glass forming alloy Cu--Zr, as well as for the Zr-based
ternary alloys (Cu$_{\mathrm{x}}$Ni$_{\mathrm{1-x}}$)Zr ($x= 0.7, 0.6$) and the
Ni-based ternary alloy Ni(Zr$_{\mathrm{x}}$Ti$_{\mathrm{1-x}}) (x= 0.5)$. All
investigated systems within this work, except the eutectics $Cu_{56}Zr_{44}$
and $Cu_{46}Zr_{54}$, exceeded the hypercooling limit $\Delta T_{\mathrm{hyp}}$
and, remarkably, every $v(\Delta T)$ relation changed significantly at $\Delta
T_{\mathrm{hyp}}$. Our results for glass forming CuZr indicate that the
influence of the diffusion coefficient $D(T)$ on $v(\Delta T)$ at high
undercoolings, as claimed in literature, cannot be the sole reason for the
existence of a maximum in the $v(\Delta T)$ behaviour. These observations could
make a valuable contribution concerning an extension of growth theories to
undercooling temperatures $\Delta T > \Delta T_{\mathrm{hyp}}$. Nevertheless,
our finding has direct consequences to various disciplines, as our earth and
all living beings are examples for non-equilibrium systems. The scatter of our
velocity data is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than measurements
performed by former works due to our experimental setup, which allowed precise
contactless triggering at a specific undercooling, and our analysis method,
which considered the respective solidification morphologies.

influenced modern physics, where a close although incomplete analogy exists
with the theory of superfluidity, which started with Onsager's and Feynman's
introduction of quantum vortices. Indeed many macroscopic properties of
superconductors and superfluids are indeed determined by vortex lines forming
different ""aggregate states"", such as vortex crystals and liquids. While
crucial importance of knots was understood for many physical systems in the
recent years, there is no known physical realization of the central element of
Kelvin theory: the stable particle-like vortex knot. Indeed, vortex loops and
knots in superfluids and ordinary superconductors form as dynamical excitations
and are unstable by Derrick theorem. This instability in fact dictates many of
the universal macroscopic properties of superfluids. Here we show that there
are superconducting states with principally different properties of the
vorticity: where vortex knots are intrinsically stable. We demonstrate that
such features should be realised near certain critical points, where the
hydro-magneto-statics of superconducting states yields stables vortex knots

particularly interested in LISA's ability to measure massive black holes
merging at frequencies near the low-frequency band edge, with masses in the
range of $\sim 10^6-10^{10}M_\odot$. We examine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
using phenomenological waveforms for inspiral, merger, and ringdown over a wide
range of massive black hole binary parameters. We employ a broad palette of
possible LISA configurations with different sensitivities at low frequencies.
For this analysis, we created a tool (github.com/mikekatz04/BOWIE) that
evaluates the change in SNR between two parameterized situations. The shifts in
SNR are computed as gains or losses as a function of binary parameters, and
graphically displayed across a two dimensional grid of parameter values. We
illustrate the use of this technique for both parameterized LISA mission
designs, as well as for considering the influence of astrophysical parameters
on gravitational wave signal models. In terms of low-frequency sensitivity,
acceleration noise or armlength is found to be the most important factor in
observing the largest massive black hole binaries, followed by break frequency
and then spectral index. LISA's ability to probe the astrophysical population
of $\sim10^7-10^9M_\odot$ black holes is greatly influenced by these aspects of

high accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a median error of 1.2%. Two
galaxies turn out to be dusty objects at lower redshifts (z<2.5), and are the

observed in two galaxies, contributing up to 30% of the K-band flux and
mimicking the colors of an old stellar population. This implies a failure rate
of only 20% for the UVJ selection at these redshifts. Balmer absorption was
identified in 4 of the brighest galaxies, confirming the absence of OB stars.
Modeling all QGs with a wide range of star-formation histories, we find sSFR a
factor of 10 below the main sequence (MS) for all but one galaxy, and less than
0.01 Gyr$^{-1}$ for half of the sample. This is consistent with the H$\beta$

QGs have quenched on average 300 Myr before observation, between z=3.5 and 5,
and that they formed at z~5.5 with a mean SFR~300 Msun/yr. Considering an
alternative selection of QGs based solely on the sSFR from SED modeling, we
find that galaxies a factor 10 below the MS are 40% more numerous than
UVJ-quiescent galaxies, implying that the UVJ selection is pure but incomplete.
Current models fail at reproducing our observations and underestimate either
the number density of QGs by more than an order of magnitude or the duration of

and kinematic evolution of a star cluster located at the center of a dwarf
galaxy is affected by the shape of its host's dark matter density profile. The
stronger central tidal fields of cuspier halos minimize the cluster's ability
to expand in response to mass loss due to stellar evolution during its early
evolutionary stages and during its subsequent long-term evolution driven by
two-body relaxation. Hence clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter halos are
characterized by more compact sizes, higher velocity dispersions and remain
approximately isotropic at all clustercentric distances. Conversely, clusters
in cored halos can expand more and develop a velocity distribution profile that
becomes increasingly radially anisotropic at larger clustercentric distances.
Finally, the larger velocity dispersion of clusters evolving in cuspier dark
matter profiles results in them having longer relaxation times. Hence clusters
in cuspy galaxies relax at a slower rate and, consequently, they are both less
mass segregated and farther from complete energy equipartition than cluster's
in cored galaxies. Application of this work to observations allows for star
clusters to be used as tools to measure the distribution of dark matter in
dwarf galaxies and to distinguish isolated star clusters from ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies.

particles. We discuss the impact of both the new force acting between the
binary partners as well as radiation of the force carrier. We identify numerous
constraints on any such scenario, ultimately concluding that observable effects
on the dynamics of binary inspirals due to such a force are not possible if the
dark matter is accrued during ordinary stellar evolution. Constraints arise
from the requirement that the astronomical body be able to collect and bind at
small enough radius an adequate number of dark matter particles, from the
requirement that the particles thus collected remain bound to neutron stars in
the presence of another neutron star, and from the requirement that the theory
allows old neutron stars to exist and retain their charge. Thus, we show that
any deviation from the predictions of general relativity observed in binary
inspirals must be due either to the material properties of the inspiraling
objects themselves, such as a tidal deformability, to a true fifth force
coupled to baryons, or to a non-standard production mechanism for the dark
matter cores of neutron stars. Viable scenarios of the latter type include
production of dark matter in exotic neutron decays, or the formation of compact
dark matter objects in the early Universe that later seed star formation or are
captured by stars.

expected we always find a region of parameter space in which the axion is a

axion, is controlled by a Yukawa coupling. When heavy [${\mathcal O}$(TeV)],
the axino decays early and poses no cosmological problems. When light

concentrate on the latter case and study in detail the decay modes of the

typical mass uncertainties. The comoving number density of MUGs at low redshift
(z < 0.3) is constrained at $(1.0\pm 0.4)x 10^-6 Mpc^-3, consistent with galaxy

predominantly early/swollen disk morphology (Sersic index 1<n<2.5) with high
stellar surface densities (<Sigma_e> ~ 10^10 M_Sun Kpc^-2). Interestingly, a
large fraction feature close companions -- at least in projection -- suggesting
that many (but not all) reside in the central regions of groups. Halo masses
show these galaxies inhabit average-mass groups. As MUGs are found to be almost
equally distributed among environments of different masses, their relative
fraction is higher in more massive overdensities, matching the expectations
that some of these galaxies fell in these regions at early times. However,
there must be another channel leading some of these galaxies to an abnormally
low merger history because our sample shows a number of objects that do not
inhabit particularly dense environments. (abridged)

wide range of applications in statistics and signal processing. One of the most
effective non-linear filtering approaches, particle filtering, suffers from
weight degeneracy in high-dimensional filtering scenarios. Several avenues have
been pursued to address high-dimensionality. Among these, particle flow
particle filters construct effective proposal distributions by using invertible
flow to migrate particles continuously from the prior distribution to the
posterior, and sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) methods use a
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) accept-reject approach to improve filtering
performance. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of invertible
particle flow and SMCMC by constructing a composite Metropolis-Hastings (MH)
kernel within the SMCMC framework using invertible particle flow. In addition,
we propose a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based particle flow algorithm to
construct effective MH kernels for multi-modal distributions. Simulation
results show that for high-dimensional state estimation example problems the
proposed kernels significantly increase the acceptance rate with minimal
additional computational overhead and improve estimation accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art filtering algorithms.

of food (bite), sipping a drink of liquid (drink), manipulating food for
preparation of intake (utensiling), not moving (rest) and a non-eating category
(other). To test this lexicography, we used our definitions to label a large
data set and tested for inter-rater reliability. The data set consists of a
total of 276 participants eating a single meal while wearing a watch-like
device to track wrist motion. Video was simultaneously recorded and
subsequently reviewed to label gestures. A total of 18 raters manually labeled
51,614 gestures. Every meal was labeled by at least 1 rater, with 95 meals
labeled by 2 raters. Inter-rater reliability was calculated in terms of
agreement, boundary ambiguity, and mistakes. Results were 92.5% agreement (75%
exact agreement, 17.5% boundary ambiguity). Mistakes of intake gestures (0.6%
bite and 1.9% drink) occur much less frequently than non-intake gestures (16.5%
utensiling and 8.7% rest). Similar rates were found across all 18 raters.
Finally, a comparison of gesture segments against single index labels of bites
and drinks from a previous effort showed an agreement of 95.8% with 0.6%
ambiguity and 3.6% mistakes. Overall, these findings take a step towards
developing a consensus lexicography of eating gestures for the research

carried out in the vacuum with stabilized saxions, which are the magnitudes of
the chiral fields. Regions of the parameter space where slow-roll inflation
occurs are exhibited and the spectral indices as well as the ratio of the

supersymmetric DBI models analyzed is that in most of the parameter space
tensor to scalar ratio and scalar spectral index are consistent with Planck
data if slow roll occurs and is not eternal. Also interesting is that the ratio
of the tensor to the scalar power spectrum can be large and can lie close to

an unlabeled `target' dataset by leveraging a labeled `source' dataset that
comes from a slightly similar distribution. We propose metric-based adversarial
discriminative domain adaptation (M-ADDA) which performs two main steps. First,
it uses a metric learning approach to train the source model on the source
dataset by optimizing the triplet loss function. This results in clusters where
embeddings of the same label are close to each other and those with different
labels are far from one another. Next, it uses the adversarial approach (as
that used in ADDA \cite{2017arXiv170205464T}) to make the extracted features
from the source and target datasets indistinguishable. Simultaneously, we
optimize a novel loss function that encourages the target dataset's embeddings
to form clusters. While ADDA and M-ADDA use similar architectures, we show that
M-ADDA performs significantly better on the digits adaptation datasets of MNIST
and USPS. This suggests that using metric-learning for domain adaptation can
lead to large improvements in classification accuracy for the domain adaptation

problem that needs to be solved millions of times a day in various computing

Along with makespan, flow-time, which measures the length of time a job spends
in a system before it completes, is arguably the most important metric to
measure the performance of a scheduling algorithm. In recent years, there has
been a remarkable progress in understanding flow-time based objective functions
in diverse settings such as unrelated machines scheduling, broadcast
scheduling, multi-dimensional scheduling, to name a few.
  Yet, our understanding of the flow-time objective is limited mostly to the
scenarios where jobs have simple structures; in particular, each job is a
single self contained entity. On the other hand, in almost all real world
applications, think of MapReduce settings for example, jobs have more complex
structures. In this paper, we consider two classical scheduling models that
capture complex job structures: 1) concurrent open-shop scheduling and 2)
precedence constrained scheduling. Our main motivation to study these problems
specifically comes from their relevance to two scheduling problems that have
gained importance in the context of data centers: co-flow scheduling and DAG
scheduling. We design almost optimal approximation algorithms for open-shop

halo masses are estimated based on previously published SZE observable to mass
scaling relations, calibrated using information that includes the halo mass

these scaling relations for massive galaxy clusters ($M_{500}\geq 3

without concern for X-ray selection biases. We find that the mass trends are

significance in the case of $L_X$ and $M_{ICM}$. The redshift trends are
consistent with the self-similar expectation, but the uncertainties remain
large. Core-included scaling relations tend to have steeper mass trends for
$L_X$. There is no convincing evidence for a redshift-dependent mass trend in
any observable. The constraints on the amplitudes of the fitted scaling

prone to scale drift and require sufficient motion parallax in successive

to leverage deep monocular depth prediction to overcome limitations of
geometry-based monocular visual odometry. To this end, we incorporate deep
depth predictions into Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) as direct virtual stereo
measurements. For depth prediction, we design a novel deep network that refines
predicted depth from a single image in a two-stage process. We train our
network in a semi-supervised way on photoconsistency in stereo images and on
consistency with accurate sparse depth reconstructions from Stereo DSO. Our
deep predictions excel state-of-the-art approaches for monocular depth on the
KITTI benchmark. Moreover, our Deep Virtual Stereo Odometry clearly exceeds
previous monocular and deep learning based methods in accuracy. It even
achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art stereo methods, while
only relying on a single camera.

differential inclusions -- capturing the continuous dynamics -- and difference
inclusions -- capturing the discrete dynamics or events -- with constraints.
State trajectories (or solutions) to such systems are parameterized by a hybrid
notion of time. For such broad class of solutions, the operators and semantics
needed to reason about temporal logic are introduced. Characterizations of
temporal logic formulas in terms of dynamical properties of hybrid systems are
presented -- in particular, forward invariance and finite time attractivity.
These characterizations are exploited to formulate sufficient conditions
assuring the satisfaction of temporal logic formulas -- when possible, these
conditions do not involve solution information. Combining the results for
formulas with a single operator, ways to certify more complex formulas are
pointed out, in particular, via a decomposition using a finite state automaton.
Academic examples illustrate the results throughout the paper.

optimizing on random, low-dimensional hypersurfaces is directly related to the
overlap between the hypersurface and the Goldilocks zone, and as a corollary
demonstrate that the notion of intrinsic dimension is initialization-dependent.
We note that common initialization techniques initialize neural networks in
this particular region of unusually high convexity/prevalence of positive

demonstrate that initializing a neural network at a number of points and
selecting for high measures of local convexity such as $\mathrm{Tr}(H) /

statistically significantly faster training on MNIST. Based on our

this paper, we develop a hybrid model of the probability distribution function
of gravitational lensing magnification taking account of both strong and weak
gravitational lensing, and use it to study the effect of gravitational lensing
magnification on the distribution of gravitational waves from distant binary
black hole mergers detected in ongoing and future gravitational wave
observations. We find that the effect of gravitational lensing magnification is
significant at high ends of observed chirp mass and redshift distributions.
While a high mass tail in the observed chirp mass distribution is produced by
highly magnified gravitational lensing events, we find that highly demagnified
images of strong lensing events produce a high redshift ($z_{\rm obs}> 15$)
tail in the observed redshift distribution, which can easily be observed in the
third-generation gravitational wave observatories. Such a demagnified,
apparently high redshift event is expected to be accompanied by a magnified
image that is observed typically $10-100$ days before the demagnified image.
For highly magnified events that produce apparently very high chirp masses, we
expect pairs of events with similar magnifications with time delays typically
less than a day. This work suggests the critical importance of gravitational
lensing (de-)magnification on the interpretation of apparently very high mass
or redshift gravitational wave events.

representation. Our method constructs a top-down multi-scale representation of
point cloud data by recursively running many small-scale data likelihood
segmentations in parallel on a GPU. We leverage the resulting representation
using a novel PCA-based optimization criterion that adaptively finds the best
scale to perform data association between spatial subsets of point cloud data.
Compared to previous Iterative Closest Point and GMM-based techniques, our
tree-based point association algorithm performs data association in
logarithmic-time while dynamically adjusting the level of detail to best match
the complexity and spatial distribution characteristics of local scene
geometry. In addition, unlike other GMM methods that restrict covariances to be
isotropic, our new PCA-based optimization criterion well-approximates the true
MLE solution even when fully anisotropic Gaussian covariances are used.
Efficient data association, multi-scale adaptability, and a robust MLE
approximation produce an algorithm that is up to an order of magnitude both
faster and more accurate than current state-of-the-art on a wide variety of 3D

Calculus is a cornerstone of Polyfold Theory, which was introduced by
Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder as a broadly applicable tool for regularizing moduli
spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves. We show how the novel nonlinear
scale-Fredholm notion in Polyfold Theory overcomes the lack of Implicit
Function Theorems, by formally establishing an often implicitly used fact: The
differentials of basic germs -- the local models for scale-Fredholm maps --
vary continuously in the space of bounded operators when the base point
changes. We moreover demonstrate that this continuity holds only in specific
coordinates, by constructing an example of a scale-diffeomorphism and
scale-Fredholm map with discontinuous differentials. This justifies the high
technical complexity in the foundations of Polyfold Theory.

context. Compared to existing solutions, Gargoyle evaluates the trustworthiness
of an access request context through a new set of contextual attributes called
Network Context Attribute (NCA). NCAs are extracted from the network traffic
and include information such as the user's device capabilities, security-level,
current and prior interactions with other devices, network connection status,
and suspicious online activities. Retrieving such information from the user's
device and its integrated sensors are challenging in terms of device
performance overheads, sensor costs, availability, reliability and
trustworthiness. To address these issues, Gargoyle leverages the capabilities
of Software-Defined Network (SDN) for both policy enforcement and
implementation. In fact, Gargoyle's SDN App can interact with the network
controller to create a `defence-in-depth' protection system. For instance,
Gargoyle can automatically quarantine a suspicious data requestor in the
enterprise network for further investigation or filter out an access request
before engaging a data provider. Finally, instead of employing simplistic
binary rules in access authorizations, Gargoyle incorporates Function-based
Access Control (FBAC) and supports the customization of access policies into a
set of functions (e.g., disabling copy, allowing print) depending on the
perceived trustworthiness of the context.

However, current seed selection strategies do not seem to be better than

polluting the atmospheres of white dwarfs. The diffusion timescale for metals
to sink from the atmosphere of a white dwarf is of the order of days for a
hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Thus, there must be a continuous supply of
metal-rich material accreting onto these white dwarfs. We investigate the role
of secular resonances that excite the eccentricity of asteroids allowing them
to reach star-grazing orbits leading them to tidal disruption and the formation
of a debris disc. Changes in the planetary system during the evolution of the
star lead to a change in the location of secular resonances. In our Solar
System, the engulfment of the Earth will cause the $\nu_6$ resonance to shift
outwards which will force previously stable asteroids to undergo secular
resonant perturbations. With analytic models and $N$--body simulations we show
that secular resonances driven by two outer companions can provide a source of
continuous pollution. Secular resonances are a viable mechanism for the
pollution of white dwarfs in a variety of exoplanetary system architectures.

human brain decoding studies. The inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and
functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to
big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper
proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional
alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large
amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can
solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using
multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has
less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other
state-of-the-art functional alignment methods.

maximizes the likelihood of preserving this neighborhood.
  In this paper, we take a drastic departure from the existing notion of
neighbourhood of a node by utilizing the idea of coreness. More specifically,
we utilize the well-established idea that nodes with similar core numbers play
equivalent roles in the network and hence induce a novel and an organic notion
of neighbourhood. Based on this idea, we propose core2vec, a new algorithmic
framework for learning low dimensional continuous feature mapping for a node.
Consequently, the nodes having similar core numbers are relatively closer in
the vector space that we learn.
  We further demonstrate the effectiveness of core2vec by comparing word
similarity scores obtained by our method where the node representations are
drawn from standard word association graphs against scores computed by other
state-of-the-art network representation techniques like node2vec, DeepWalk and

Daskalakis et al. (2018) for optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in bilinear

method for femtosecond time-resolved chiral spectroscopy using high harmonic
generation (HHG). The method is based on dynamical symmetry breaking from

on the interplay of electric and magnetic dipoles. The symmetry breaking
results in the emission of a strong chiral signal in the form of otherwise
'forbidden' harmonics (i.e., that are not emitted from achiral media). The
intensity of these symmetry-forbidden harmonics is directly correlated to the
media's enantiomeric excess, yielding chiral selectivity. On the contrary, the
strength of the 'allowed' harmonics is chiral-independent, hence they can be
used as a reference to provide chiral selectivity from a single measurement,
unlike previous time-resolved schemes that require multiple measurements. We
demonstrate numerically 96% discrimination level from microscopic gas phase
emission, outperforming by far previous time-resolved methods (the selectivity
should be further enhanced when the HHG process is phase matched). We expect
the new method to give rise to precise table-top characterization of chiral
media in the gas-phase, and for highly sensitive time-resolved ultrafast
probing of dynamical chiral processes.

problem, receiving much attention in recent years. Recent approaches for
full-body reconstruction use a statistic shape model, which is built upon
accurate full-body scans of people in skin-tight clothes, to complete invisible
parts due to occlusion. Such a statistic model may still be fit to an RGB-D
measurement with loose clothes but cannot describe its deformations, such as
clothing wrinkles. Observed surfaces may be reconstructed precisely from actual
measurements, while we have no cues for unobserved surfaces. For full-body
reconstruction with loose clothes, we propose to use lower dimensional
embeddings of texture and deformation referred to as eigen-texturing and
eigen-deformation, to reproduce views of even unobserved surfaces. Provided a
full-body reconstruction from a sequence of partial measurements as 3D meshes,
the texture and deformation of each triangle are then embedded using
eigen-decomposition. Combined with neural-network-based coefficient regression,
our method synthesizes the texture and deformation from arbitrary viewpoints.
We evaluate our method using simulated data and visually demonstrate how our
method works on real data.

three-center integrals and fitting with first-principles calculations. Details
of the semi-empirical fitting procedure for constructing the EBOM Hamiltonian
for bulk III-nitride WZ semiconductors are presented. The electronic band
structure of bulk AlN, GaN, and InN with WZ structure calculated by EBOM with
modified interaction parameters are shown and compared to the results obtained
from density functional (DFT) theory with meta-generalized gradient
approximation (mGGA). The set of parameters are further optimized by using a
genetic algorithm. In the end, electronic band structures and electron (hole)
effective masses near the zone center calculated by the proposed model with
best fitting parameters are analyzed and compared with the $\mathbf{k}\cdot
\mathbf{p}$ model.

  from referee and community",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aae0fd",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is believed that satellites of giant planets form in circumplanetary
disks. Many of the previous contributions assumed that their formation process
proceeds similarly to rocky planet formation, via accretion of the satellite
seeds, called satellitesimals. However, the satellitesimal formation itself
poses a nontrivial problem as the dust evolution in the circumplanetary disk is
heavily impacted by fast radial drift and thus dust growth to satellitesimals
is hindered. To address this problem, we connected state-of-the-art
hydrodynamical simulations of a circumplanetary disk around a Jupiter-mass
planet with dust growth and drift model in a post-processing step. We found
that there is an efficient pathway to satellitesimal formation if there is a
dust trap forming within the disk. Thanks to the natural existence of an
outward gas flow region in the hydrodynamical simulation, a significant dust
trap arises at the radial distance of 85~R$_{\rm J}$ from the planet, where the
dust-to-gas ratio becomes high enough to trigger streaming instability. The
streaming instability leads to the efficient formation of the satellite seeds.
Because of the constant infall of material from the circumstellar disk and the
very short timescale of dust evolution, the circumplanetary disk acts as a
satellitesimal factory, constantly processing the infalling dust to pebbles
that gather in the dust trap and undergo the streaming instability.

been a topic of long-standing discussion, recent developments in physics have
pushed the boundaries of this debate to new and still unexplored realms. For it
is claimed that, in certain theories of quantum gravity, spacetime
'disappears': and this suggests that one may have sensible physical theories in
which spacetime is completely absent. This makes the philosophical question
whether such theories are intelligible, even more pressing. And if such
theories are intelligible, the question then is how they manage to do so. In
this paper, we adapt the contextual theory of scientific understanding,
developed by one of us, to fit the novel challenges posed by physical theories
without spacetime. We construe understanding as a matter of skill rather than
just knowledge. The appeal is thus to understanding, rather than explanation,
because we will be concerned with the tools that scientists have at their
disposal for understanding these theories. Our central thesis is that such
physical theories can provide scientific understanding, and that such
understanding does not require spacetimes of any sort. Our argument consists of
four consecutive steps: (a) We argue, from the general theory of scientific
understanding, that although visualization is an oft-used tool for
understanding, it is not a necessary condition for it; (b) we criticise certain
metaphysical preconceptions which can stand in the way of recognising how
intelligibility without spacetime can be had; (c) we catalogue tools for
rendering theories without a spacetime intelligible; and (d) we give examples
of cases in which understanding is attained without a spacetime, and explain
what kind of understanding these examples provide.

in which a qubit is used as the probe to sense the frequency of a harmonic
oscillator. We show that by applying adaptive periodic quantum control on the
qubit, the sensing precision can be enhanced from 1/T scaling with the total
time cost T to 1/T^{2} scaling, thus improving the precision by several orders
of magnitudes. Such improvement can be achieved without any direct access to
the oscillator and the improvement increases with decreasing probe-target
coupling. This provides a useful routine to ultrasensitive quantum sensing of
weakly coupled quantum objects.

when it comes to medical dataset. Because the case with a serious degree is not
quite usual, there are imbalance in number of dataset between severe case and
normal cases of diseases. Also, there is difficulty in precisely identifying
grade of medical data because of vagueness between them. To solve these

Tournament based Ranking CNN which shows remarkable performance gain in
identifying dominated classes while trading off very small accuracy loss in
dominating classes. Our Approach complemented problems that occur when method
of Ranking CNN that aggregates outputs of multiple binary neural network models
is applied to medical data. By having tournament structure in aggregating

recorded 68.36% of exact match accuracy, while Ranking CNN recorded 53.40%,
pretrained Resnet recorded 56.12% and CNN with linear regression recorded

also can be applied further to medical problems which have similar features to

Based on the hair cuticle scale pattern, type and diameter of the medulla, and
the pigmentation, characteristic differential features of each animal species
were identified. The cuticle scale pattern was imbricate in all tested animals
except in donkey, in which coronal scales were identified. The cuticle scale
margin type, shape and the distance in between were characteristic for each
animal species. The hair medulla was continuous in most of the tested animal
species with the exception of sheep, in which fragmental medulla was detected.
The diameter of the hair medulla and the margins differ according to the animal
species. Hair shaft pigmentation were not detected in all tested animals with
the exception of camel and buffalo, in which granules and streak-like

misleading conclusions. We present a flexible family of state-space models

scales, from long-term trends and decadal variability, short term weather
noise, observational errors and changes in autocorrelation. Standard potential
predictability models only estimate the fraction of the total variance in the
index attributable to external forcing. In addition, our methodology allows us
to partition individual seasonal means into forced, slow, fast and error
components. Changes in the predictable signal within the season can also be
estimated. The model can also be used in forecast mode to assess both intra-
and inter-seasonal predictability.
  We apply the proposed methodology to a North Atlantic Oscillation index for
the years 1948-2017. Around 60% of the inter-annual variance in the

external forcing, and 8% to trends on longer time-scales. In some years, the
external forcing remains relatively constant throughout the winter season, in
others it changes during the season. Skillful statistical forecasts of the

within the ring occurs at larger substrate temperature. The smaller particles
deposit at the outermost edge as compared to the larger diameter particles and
this preferential deposition in a stagnation region near the contact line is
due to the spatially-varying height of the liquid-gas interface above the
substrate. The sorting occurs at a smaller ratio of the diameter of the smaller

the particles do not get sorted and mix into each other. Our measurements show

attention towards the realization of broadband resonators and antennas. We show
that fractal resonators can support the emergence of high-dimensional chaotic
dynamics even in the context of an elementary, single-transistor oscillator
circuit. Sierpi\'nski gaskets of variable depth are constructed using discrete
capacitors and inductors, whose values are scaled according to a simple
sequence. It is found that in regular fractals of this kind each iteration
effectively adds a conjugate pole/zero pair, yielding gradually more complex
and broader frequency responses, which can also be implemented as much smaller
Foster equivalent networks. The resonators are instanced in the circuit as
one-port devices, replacing the inductors found in the initial version of the
oscillator. By means of a highly simplified numerical model, it is shown that
increasing the fractal depth elevates the dimension of the chaotic dynamics,
leading to high-order hyperchaos. This result is overall confirmed by SPICE
simulations and experiments, which however also reveal that the non-ideal
behavior of physical components hinders obtaining high-dimensional dynamics.
The issue could be practically mitigated by building the Foster equivalent
networks rather than the verbatim fractals. Furthermore, it is shown that
considerably more complex resonances, and consequently richer dynamics, can be
obtained by rendering the fractal resonators irregular through reshuffling the

including both one- and two-photon terms are found by using Bogoliubov
operators. Transcendental functions in terms of $4 \times 4$ determinants
responsible for the exact solutions are derived. These so-called $G$-functions
with pole structures can be reduced to the previous ones in the unmixed QRMs.
The zeros of $G$-functions reproduce completely the regular spectra. The
exceptional eigenvalues can also be obtained by another transcendental
function. From the pole structure, we can derive two energy limits when the
two-photon coupling strength tends to the collapse point. All energy levels
only collapse to the lower one, which diverges negatively. The level crossings
in the unmixed QRMs are relaxed to avoided crossings in the present mixed QRM
due to absence of parity symmetry. In the weak two-photon coupling regime, the
mixed QRM is equivalent to an one-photon QRM with an effective positive bias,
suppressed photon frequency and enhanced one-photon coupling, which may pave a
highly efficient and economic way to access the deep-strong one-photon coupling
regime.

transitions and quantum states of matter. As a prominent example, the integer
quantum Hall effect (QHE) represents a topological phase generally regarded as
characteristic for two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems, and its many
aspects can be understood without invoking electron-electron interaction. The
intriguing possibility of generalizing QHE to three-dimensional (3D) systems
was proposed decades ago, yet it remains elusive experimentally. Here, we
report clear experimental evidence for the 3D QHE observed in bulk ZrTe5
crystals. Owing to the extremely high sample quality, the extreme quantum limit
with only the lowest Landau level occupied can be achieved by an applied
magnetic field as low as 1.5 T. Remarkably, in this regime, we observe a
dissipationless longitudinal resistivity rho_xx=0 accompanied with a
well-developed Hall resistivity plateau rho_xy=(1\pm0.1) h/e^2
(\lambda_(F,z)/2), where \lambda_(F,z) is the Fermi wavelength along the field
direction (z axis). This striking result strongly suggests a Fermi surface
instability driven by the enhanced interaction effects in the extreme quantum
limit. In addition, with further increasing magnetic field, both rho_xx and
rho_xy increase dramatically and display an interesting metal-insulator
transition, representing another magnetic field driven quantum phase
transition. Our findings not only unambiguously reveal a novel quantum state of
matter resulting from an intricate interplay among dimensionality, interaction,
and symmetry breaking, but also provide a promising platform for further
exploration of more exotic quantum phases and transitions in 3D systems.

so-called $\mathbf{k}$-DE-GWF method, based on reciprocal-space
($\mathbf{k}$-resolved) diagrammatic expansion of the variational
Gutzwiller-type wave function for parametrized models of correlated fermions.
The present approach, in contrast to either variational Monte-Carlo (VMC), or
the recently developed real-space diagrammatic expansion of the Gutzwiller-type
wave function (direct-space DE-GWF technique), is applicable directly in the
thermodynamic limit and thus is suitable for describing selected singular
features of the wave-vector-dependent quantities. We employ the
$\mathbf{k}$-DE-GWF method to extract the non-analytic part of the two leading
moments of the fermion spectral-density function across the (two-dimensional)
Brillouin zone for the Hubbard model and away from the half-filling. Those
moments are used to evaluate the nodal quasiparticle velocities and their
spectral weights in the correlated superconducting state. The two velocities
determined in that manner exhibit scaling with the electron concentration
qualitatively different from that obtained earlier for the excited states of
the high-$T_c$ cuprates within the projected quasi-particle ansatz, and the
results are in a very good quantitative agreement with experimental data if
interpreted as those characterizing the spectrum below and above the observed
kink. We provide a detailed discussion of the two gaps and two excitation
branches (two velocities) appearing naturally within our DE-GWF approach. The
two separate sets of characteristics distinguish the renormalized quasiparticle
states very close to the Fermi surface from the deeper correlated-state
properties. Also, an enhancement of the $\mathbf{k}$-dependent magnetic
susceptibility is shown to contain a spin-fluctuation contribution within our
language.

voltage-length product of 2.2 Vcm, high linearity, electro-optic bandwidth of
at least 70 GHz and modulation rates up to 112 Gbit/s. The high-performance
modulator is realized by seamless integration of high-contrast waveguide based
on Lithium Niobate - the most mature modulator material - with compact,
low-loss silicon circuits. The hybrid platform demonstrated here allows for the
combination of 'best-in-breed' active and passive components, opening up new
avenues for enabling future high-speed, energy efficient and cost-effective
optical communication networks.

crystal micro fiber growth process by micro-pulling-down method is
presented.the description concerns the following aspects:the free surface
equation and the pressure difference across the free surface (section 2);limits
of the pressure difference p across the free surface (section3;the fiber radius
change due to the change of the pressure difference p,and the fiber radius size
control(section 4);the static stability of the free surface (section 5). The
above aspects are numerically illustrated in case of the growth of a silicon
fiber of radius equal to 0.0001 m by using the Maple 17 software. This
description can be helpful in the better understanding of the growth process
and in the automation of manufacturing
