  Halide Perovskites",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Halide perovskites are promising semiconductors for inexpensive,
high-performance optoelectronics. Despite a remarkable defect tolerance
compared to conventional semiconductors, perovskite thin films still show
substantial microscale heterogeneity in key properties such as luminescence
efficiency and device performance. This behavior has been attributed to spatial
fluctuations in the population of sub-bandgap electronic states that act as
trap-mediated non-radiative recombination sites. However, the origin of the
variations, trap states and extent of the defect tolerance remains a topic of
debate, and a precise understanding is critical to the rational design of
defect management strategies. By combining scanning X-ray diffraction beamlines
at two different synchrotrons with high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy, we reveal levels of heterogeneity on the ten-micrometer scale
(super-grains) and even ten-nanometer scale (sub-grain domains). We find that
local strain is associated with enhanced defect concentrations, and
correlations between the local structure and time-resolved photoluminescence
reveal that these strain-related defects are the cause of non-radiative
recombination. We reveal a direct connection between defect concentrations and
non-radiative losses, as well as complex heterogeneity across multiple length
scales, shedding new light on the presence and influence of structural defects
in halide perovskites.

cause of dementia in the elderly. The extracellular accumulation of
amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) in senile plaques is a principal event in the
pathogenesis and there is growing evidence that the dysregulation of lipid
pathways is implicated in the disease, however the link between these two is
still under study. In this work, we investigated human brain samples, from 11
AD patients and a control cohort of age-matched subjects without AD, using
label-free chemically-specific Raman micro-spectroscopy. The collected image
data were quantitatively analysed using an efficient quantitative
unsupervised/partially supervised non-negative matrix factorization method, to
retrieve the concentration maps and spectra of the samples' chemical
constituents. Significant changes in lipid composition as well as increased
concentrations of oxidative stress bio-markers were observed in AD tissues
compared to the control. In particular, the analysis revealed accumulations of
cholesteryl esters with saturated long-chain fatty acids (FAs), A$\beta$
fibrils, arachidic acid, fibrin, collagen-like amyloidogenic component (CLAC),
$\beta$-carotene and magnetite, co-localising in A$\beta$ plaques of AD human
brains and exhibiting concentrations highest at the fibrillar core and lowest
at the rim. This finding opens perspectives for new anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant drug strategies, designed to restore brain homeostasis as potential
therapeutics of AD. We also demonstrate by the means of spatial concentration
histograms that these identified species separate AD from non-demented control
brains, beneficial for AD diagnosis.

given by a potential, which has two metastable states and two pathways between
them. Depending on the direction of the forcing the height of the two barriers,
one for each path, will either oscillate alternating or in synchronisation.
  We consider a simplified model given by discrete and continuous time Markov
Chains with two states. This was done for alternating and synchronised wells.
The invariant measures are derived for both cases and shown to be constant for
the synchronised case. A PDF for the escape time from an oscillatory potential
is reviewed.
  Methods of detecting stochastic resonance are presented, which are linear
response, signal-to-noise ratio, energy, out-of-phase measures, relative
entropy and entropy. A new statistical test called the conditional
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is developed, which can be used to analyse stochastic
resonance.
  An explicit two dimensional potential is introduced, the critical point
structure derived and the dynamics, the invariant state and escape time studied
numerically.
  The six measures are unable to detect the stochastic resonance in the case of
synchronised saddles. The distribution of escape times however not only shows a
clear sign of stochastic resonance, but changing the direction of the forcing
from alternating to synchronised saddles an additional resonance at double the
forcing frequency starts to appear. The conditional KS test reliably detects
the stochastic resonance even for forcing quick enough and for data so sparse
that the stochastic resonance is not obvious directly from the histogram of
escape times.

transmission and distribution power grids. At present, disparate methods exist
for steady-state analysis of the transmission (power flow) and distribution
power grid (three-phase power flow). Due to the non-linear nature of the
problem, it is difficult for alternating current (AC) power flow and
three-phase power flow analyses to ensure convergence to the correct physical
solution, particularly from arbitrary initial conditions, or when evaluating a
change (e.g. contingency) in the grid. In this paper, we describe our
equivalent circuit formulation approach with current and voltage variables that
models both the positive sequence network of the transmission grid and
three-phase network of the distribution grid without loss of generality. The
proposed circuit models and formalism enable the extension and application of
circuit simulation techniques to solve for the steady-state solution with
excellent robustness of convergence. Examples for positive sequence
transmission and three-phase distribution systems, including actual 75k+ nodes
Eastern Interconnection transmission test cases and 8k+ nodes taxonomy
distribution test cases, are solved from arbitrary initial guesses to
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

diffusion theories is that a small group of nodes -- called influencers -- have
the largest impact on social contagion and epidemic processes in networks.
Despite the long-standing interest in the influencers identification problem in
socio-economic and biological networks, there is not yet agreement on which is
the best identification strategy. State-of-the-art strategies are typically
based either on heuristic centrality metrics or on analytic arguments that only
hold for specific network topologies or peculiar dynamical regimes. Here, we
leverage the recently introduced random-walk effective distance -- a
topological metric that estimates almost perfectly the arrival time of
diffusive spreading processes on networks -- to introduce a new centrality
metric which quantifies how close a node is to the other nodes. We show that
the new centrality metric significantly outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in
detecting the influencers for global contagion processes. Our findings reveal
the essential role of the network effective distance for the influencers
identification and lead us closer to the optimal solution of the problem.

for a given model, $L_0$ and $|\omega|$, we observe that a difference between
ingrowing ($\omega<0$) and outgrowing ($\omega>0$) systems arises only at long
times ($t \gtrsim t_c=L_0/|\omega|$), when the expanding surfaces cross over to
the statistics of curved KPZ systems, whereas the shrinking ones become
completely correlated. A generalization of the Family-Vicsek scaling for the
roughness of ingrowing interfaces is presented. Our results demonstrate that a
transient flat statistics is a general feature of systems starting with large
initial sizes, regardless their curvature. This is consistent with their recent
observation in ingrowing turbulent liquid crystal interfaces, but it is in

presented deep learning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Furthermore, we
show that generated medical images can be used for synthetic data augmentation,
and improve the performance of CNN for medical image classification. Our novel
method is demonstrated on a limited dataset of computed tomography (CT) images
of 182 liver lesions (53 cysts, 64 metastases and 65 hemangiomas). We first
exploit GAN architectures for synthesizing high quality liver lesion ROIs. Then
we present a novel scheme for liver lesion classification using CNN. Finally,
we train the CNN using classic data augmentation and our synthetic data
augmentation and compare performance. In addition, we explore the quality of
our synthesized examples using visualization and expert assessment. The
classification performance using only classic data augmentation yielded 78.6%
sensitivity and 88.4% specificity. By adding the synthetic data augmentation
the results increased to 85.7% sensitivity and 92.4% specificity. We believe
that this approach to synthetic data augmentation can generalize to other
medical classification applications and thus support radiologists' efforts to
improve diagnosis.

  of this preprint with arXiv:1708.06258. To appear in Comment. Math. Helv",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Lagrange and Markov spectra are classical objects in Number Theory
related to certain Diophantine approximation problems. Geometrically, they are
the spectra of heights of geodesics in the modular surface.
  These objects were first studied by A. Markov in 1879, but, despite many
efforts, the structure of the complement $M\setminus L$ of the Lagrange
spectrum $L$ in the Markov spectrum $M$ remained somewhat mysterious. In fact,
it was shown by G. Freiman (in 1968 and 1973) and M. Flahive (in 1977) that
$M\setminus L$ contains infinite \emph{countable} subsets near 3.11 and 3.29,
and T. Cusick conjectured in 1975 that all elements of $M\setminus L$ were
$<\sqrt{12}=3.46\dots$, and this was the \emph{status quo} of our knowledge of
$M\setminus L$ until 2017.
  In this article, we show the following two results. First, we prove that
$M\setminus L$ is \emph{richer} than it was previously thought because it
contains a Cantor set of Hausdorff dimension larger than $1/2$ near $3.7$: in
particular, this solves (negatively) Cusick's conjecture mentioned above.
Secondly, we show that $M\setminus L$ is \emph{not} very thick: its Hausdorff
dimension is strictly smaller than one.

address the problem of calibrating an imperfect computer model using
observational data from a complex physical system. The calibration parameter
and the physical system are parametrized in an identifiable fashion via
$L_2$-projection. The physical process is assigned a Gaussian process prior,
which naturally induces a prior distribution on the calibration parameter
through the $L_2$-projection constraint. The calibration parameter is estimated
through its posterior distribution, which provides a natural and non-asymptotic
way for the uncertainty quantification. We provide a rigorous large sample
justification for the proposed approach by establishing the asymptotic
normality of the posterior of the calibration parameter with the efficient
covariance matrix. In addition, two efficient computational algorithms based on
stochastic approximation are designed with theoretical guarantees. Through
extensive simulation studies and two real-world datasets analyses, we show that
the Bayesian projected calibration can accurately estimate the calibration
parameters, appropriately calibrate the computer models, and compare favorably

Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. Though many POI recommenders have been

rely on such systems when one needs a contextually coherent list of locations,
that can be used for various day-to-day activities, for e.g., itinerary

Personalized POI Sequence Recommender System) that generates contextually
coherent POI sequences relevant to user preferences. To the best of our
knowledge, CAPS is the first attempt to formulate the contextual POI sequence
modeling by extending Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variants. CAPS
extends RNN by incorporating multiple contexts to the hidden layer and by
incorporating global context (sequence features) to the hidden layers and the
output layer. It extends the variants of RNN (e.g., Long-short term memory

update relations. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) it models the
contextual POI sequence problem by incorporating personalized user preferences
through multiple constraints (e.g., categorical, social, temporal, etc.), (ii)
it extends RNN to incorporate the contexts of individual item and that of the
whole sequence. It also extends the gated functionality of variants of RNN to
incorporate the multiple contexts, and (iii) it evaluates the proposed models

the increasing availability of large-scale traffic data and its importance in
the real world. For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi
companies in pre-allocating taxis. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies
in how to model the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics.
Although both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make
strong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e.,
spatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly
periodical. However, in practice, the spatial dependence could be dynamic
(i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some
perturbation from one period to another period. In this paper, we make two
important observations: (1) the spatial dependencies between locations are
dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows daily and weekly pattern but
it is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. To address these
two issues, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN), in
which a flow gating mechanism is introduced to learn the dynamic similarity
between locations, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed
to handle long-term periodic temporal shifting. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that tackles both issues in a unified framework. Our
experimental results on real-world traffic datasets verify the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer, and overcome two fundamental challenges of
decentralizing crowdsourcing, i.e., data leakage and identity breach.
  First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between the
blockchain transparency and the data confidentiality to guarantee the basic
utilities/fairness requirements of data crowdsourcing, thus ensuring: (i) a
requester will not pay more than what data deserve, according to a policy
announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each worker
indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the
blockchain; (iii) the above properties are realized not only without a central
arbiter, but also without leaking the data to the open blockchain. Second, the
transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about
workers and requesters through their participation history. Simply enabling
anonymity is seemingly attempting but will allow malicious workers to submit
multiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer also overcomes this problem by
allowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing accountability. The
idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task,
anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable
across tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel
cryptographic concept, i.e., the common-prefix-linkable anonymous
authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of
independent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image
annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results

a bit surprisingly, the understanding to its model identifiability---the major
reason behind the interpretability in many applications such as topic mining

Beginning from the 2010s, the identifiability research of NMF has progressed
considerably: Many interesting and important results have been discovered by
the signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) communities. NMF
identifiability has a great impact on many aspects in practice, such as
ill-posed formulation avoidance and performance-guaranteed algorithm design. On
the other hand, there is no tutorial paper that introduces NMF from an
identifiability viewpoint. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by
offering a comprehensive and deep tutorial on model identifiability of NMF as
well as the connections to algorithms and applications. This tutorial will help
researchers and graduate students grasp the essence and insights of NMF,
thereby avoiding typical `pitfalls' that are often times due to unidentifiable
NMF formulations. This paper will also help practitioners pick/design suitable

that external secular perturbations upon self-gravitating disks exhibit a

We will show however, for an incompressible flow, in the context of a specific
diffuse interface model, one can maintain the boundedness of the phase field
while also taking advantage of the low cost and ease of implementation of
central differences to construct a non-dissipative discretization scheme for
the advective terms. This is made possible by combining the advection and
reinitialization steps of a conservative level set scheme introduced by Olsson
and Kreiss [J. Comput. Phys., 210, 225 (2005)] to form a phase field equation
similar to that of Chiu and Lin [J. Comput. Phys., 230, 185 (2011)]. Instead of
resorting to specialized upwind methods as in these articles, we prove that the
boundedness of the phase field is guaranteed for certain choices of the free
parameters ($\epsilon$ and $\gamma$) for a specific central difference scheme
that we propose. The proposed discretely conservative and bounded phase field
equation, which is free of any reinitialization or mass redistribution,
possesses desirable properties that can be leveraged in the coupled finite
difference discretization of the two-phase momentum equation. Additionally, as
compared to the state-of-the-art conservative and bounded two-phase flow
methods, the proposed method boasts competitive accuracy-vs-cost trade-off,
small memory requirements, ease of implementation and excellent
parallelizability, providing a viable alternative for realistic two-phase flow

Based on predicted future delays per queue or lane, a VOT-heterogeneous
population of agents can agree to switch lanes or queues and transfer payments
to each other in order to minimize the total cost of the incoming platoon. The
strategic interaction is captured by an n-level Stackelberg model with
coalitions, while the cooperative structure is formulated as a partition
function game (PFG). The stability concept explored is the strong-core for PFGs
which we found appropiate given the nature of the problem. This concept ensures
that the efficient allocation is individually rational and coalitionally
stable. We analyze this control mechanism for two settings: a static vertical
queue and a dynamic horizontal queue. For the former, we first characterize the
properties of the underlying cooperative game. Our simulation results suggest
that the setting is always strong-core stable. For the latter, we propose a new
relaxation program for the strong-core concept. Our simulation results on a
freeway bottleneck with constant outflow using Newell's car-following model
show the imputations to be generally strong-core stable and the coalitional
instabilities to remain small with regard to users' costs.

burst, with observations beginning 270 seconds after the onset of BAT emission,
and only 135 seconds after the main BAT emission peak. No statistically
significant signal is detected above 140 GeV. The VERITAS upper limit on the
fluence in a 40 minute integration corresponds to about 1% of the prompt
fluence. Our limit is particularly significant since the very-high-energy (VHE)
observation started only $\sim$2 minutes after the prompt emission peaked, and
$Fermi$-LAT observations of numerous other bursts have revealed that the
high-energy emission is typically delayed relative to the prompt radiation and
lasts significantly longer. Also, the proximity of GRB~150323A ($z=0.593$)
limits the attenuation by the extragalactic background light to $\sim 50$ % at
100-200 GeV. We conclude that GRB 150323A had an intrinsically very weak
high-energy afterglow, or that the GeV spectrum had a turnover below $\sim100$
GeV. If the GRB exploded into the stellar wind of a massive progenitor, the VHE
non-detection constrains the wind density parameter to be $A\gtrsim 3\times
10^{11}$ g cm$^{-1}$, consistent with a standard Wolf-Rayet progenitor.
Alternatively, the VHE emission from the blast wave would be weak in a very
tenuous medium such as the ISM, which therefore cannot be ruled out as the
environment of GRB 150323A.

performing direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a two-dimensional
Rayleigh-Darcy domain. Scaling analysis of the governing equations shows that
the dynamics of this system are not only controlled by the classical
Rayleigh-Darcy number based on molecular diffusion, $Ra_m$, and the domain
aspect ratio, but also controlled by two other dimensionless parameters: the
dispersive Rayleigh number $Ra_d = H/\alpha_t$ and the dispersivity ratio $r =
\alpha_l/\alpha_t$, where $H$ is the domain height, $\alpha_t$ and $\alpha_l$
are the transverse and longitudinal dispersivities, respectively. For $\Delta =
Ra_d/Ra_m > O(1)$, the influence from the mechanical dispersion is minor; for
$\Delta \ll 1$, however, the flow pattern is controlled by $Ra_d$ while the
convective flux is $F\sim Ra_m$ for large $Ra_m$, but with a prefactor that has
a non-monotonic dependence on $Ra_d$. Our DNS results also show that the
increase of mechanical dispersion, i.e. decreasing $Ra_d$, will coarsen the
convective pattern by increasing the plume spacing. Moreover, the inherent
anisotropy of mechanical dispersion breaks the columnar structure of the
mega-plumes at large $Ra_m$, if $Ra_d < 5000$. This results in a fan-flow
geometry that reduces the convective flux.

Such graphs accelerate the proper testing of new algorithms and systems and are

based on Markov chain analysis and memory-one strategies. We generalize this
approach and introduce the concept of strategy parameter to show that linear
relations among player payoffs are a ubiquitous feature of the infinitely
iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game. Our extended analysis is applied to various
strategy profiles including tit-for-tat, win-stay-lose-shift, and other
randomized strategy sets. Strategy profiles are identified that map onto the
vertices, edges, and interior of the Prisoner's Dilemma quadrilateral in the
2-dimensional payoff (score) space. A DaMD strategy is defined based solely on
""Defection after Mutual Defection"" and leads to linear relations between player
scores using strategy parameter analysis. The DaMD strategy is shown to result
in an equal (reciprocal) or larger (extortive) score for its user compare to
the other player, independent of the strategy of the other player. The
extortive scores occur when the probabilities for the DaMD player to cooperate
after conflicting plays (cooperate-defect or defect-cooperate) sum to less than
1. The equal reciprocal scores occur when the probabilities for the DaMD player
to cooperate after conflicting plays (cooperate-defect or defect-cooperate) sum
to 1. When one player selects the extortive DaMD, the opposing player can force
the equal punishment payoffs for both players in the infinitely iterated

gravitons. We compute some correlation functions including these couplings in
the soft-graviton limit. We show that when the number of soft-gravitons is
getting larger, the peak of the correlation function is shifted to larger mass
of the scalar particle. In addition we derive a relation, which relates
correlation functions with N+1 to N soft-gravitons when the mass of the scalar
particle becomes much higher than 10^14 GeV, and confirm the relation by
numerical analysis.

fluorescence detector is also sensitive to the Cherenkov light produced by

detectable by TALE as ""Cherenkov Events"". Using these events, we measure the
energy spectrum from a low energy of $\sim 2$ PeV to an energy greater than 100
PeV. Above 100 PeV TALE can detect cosmic rays using air fluorescence. This
allows for the extension of the measurement to energies greater than a few EeV.
In this paper, we will describe the detector, explain the technique, and
present results from a measurement of the spectrum using $\sim 1000$ hours of
observation. The observed spectrum shows a clear steepening near $10^{17.1}$
eV, along with an ankle-like structure at $10^{16.2}$ eV. These features
present important constraints on galactic cosmic rays origin and propagation
models. The feature at $10^{17.1}$ eV may also mark the end of the galactic
cosmic rays flux and the start of the transition to extra-galactic sources.

understanding the complexity in the organization of life. Bacterial motility
determines the spatio-temporal structure of microbial communities, controls
infection spreading and the microbiota organization in guts or in soils. Most
theoretical approaches for modeling bacterial transport rely on their
run-and-tumble motion. For Escherichia coli, the run time distribution was
reported to follow a Poisson process with a single characteristic time related
to the rotational switching of the flagellar motors. However, direct
measurements on flagellar motors show heavy-tailed distributions of rotation
times stemming from the intrinsic noise in the chemotactic mechanism.
Currently, there is no direct experimental evidence that the stochasticity in
the chemotactic machinery affect the macroscopic motility of bacteria. In stark
contrast with the accepted vision of run-and-tumble, here we report a large
behavioral variability of wild-type \emph{E. coli}, revealed in their
three-dimensional trajectories. At short observation times, a large
distribution of run times is measured on a population and attributed to the
slow fluctuations of a signaling protein triggering the flagellar motor
reversal. Over long times, individual bacteria undergo significant changes in
motility. We demonstrate that such a large distribution of run times introduces
measurement biases in most practical situations. Our results reconcile the
notorious conundrum between run time observations and motor switching
statistics. We finally propose that statistical modeling of transport
properties currently undertaken in the emerging framework of active matter
studies, should be reconsidered under the scope of this large variability of
motility features.

  In this paper, we propose a novel method, SCOUT. The central insight of SCOUT
is that using prior measurements, even those for different workloads, improves
search performance and reduces search cost. At its core, SCOUT extracts search
hints (inference of resource requirements) from low-level performance metrics.
Such hints enable SCOUT to navigate through the search space more
efficiently---only spotlight region will be searched.
  We evaluate SCOUT with 107 workloads on Apache Hadoop and Spark. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach finds better cloud

  Based on this work, we conclude that (i) low-level performance information is

The diquark approximation is adopted so that the methods developed in the $B$

transition form factors are calculated in the framework of a covariant
light-front quark model. The form factors $f_3, ~g_3$ can be extracted and are

accelerated variants thereof. There have been only a few studies of methods
that use a second-order approximation to the smooth part, due in part to the
difficulty of obtaining closed-form solutions to the subproblems at each
iteration. In fact, iterative algorithms may need to be used to find inexact
solutions to these subproblems. In this work, we present global analysis of the
iteration complexity of inexact successive quadratic approximation methods,
showing that an inexact solution of the subproblem that is within a fixed
multiplicative precision of optimality suffices to guarantee the same order of
convergence rate as the exact version, with complexity related in an intuitive
way to the measure of inexactness. Our result allows flexible choices of the
second-order term, including Newton and quasi-Newton choices, and does not
necessarily require increasing precision of the subproblem solution on later
iterations. For problems exhibiting a property related to strong convexity, the
algorithms converge at global linear rates. For general convex problems, the
convergence rate is linear in early stages, while the overall rate is $O(1/k)$.
For nonconvex problems, a first-order optimality criterion converges to zero at

We restrict ourselves to a setting where the distributed sensors are probed
with experimentally practical resources, namely, field modes in separable
displaced thermal states, and focus on the optimal design of the optical
receiver that measures the phase-shifted returning field modes. Within this
setting, we demonstrate that a locally optimal measurement strategy, i.e., one
that achieves the standard quantum limit for all phase shift values, is a
Gaussian measurement, and moreover, one that is separable. We also demonstrate
the utility of adaptive phase measurements for making estimation performance
robust in cases where one has little prior information on the unknown
parameters. In this setting we identify a regime where it is beneficial to use
structured optical receivers that entangle the received modes before
measurement.

search based on gradient descent, and input length exploration. On the LAVA-M
data set, Angora found almost all the injected bugs, found more bugs than any
other fuzzer that we compared with, and found eight times as many bugs as the
second-best fuzzer in the program who. Angora also found 103 bugs that the LAVA

observed for various glass-forming liquids. The local order of tetrahedral
structures due to hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) increases with decreasing
temperature. Thus, it is important to clarify the temperature dependence of the
H-bond breakage process. This was investigated here using molecular dynamics
simulations of TIP4P supercooled water. The two-dimensional (2D) potential of
mean force (PMF) is presented using combinations of intermolecular distance and
angle between two water molecules. The saddle point of the 2D PMF suggests the
presence of the transition state that distinguishes between H-bond and non
H-bond states. However, we observed pathways not going through this saddle
point particularly at supercooled states, which are due to translational,
rather than rotational motions of the molecules. We quantified the
characteristic time scales of rotational and translational H-bond breakages.
The time scale of translational H-bond breakage shows a non-Arrhenius
temperature dependence comparable to that of the H-bond lifetime. This time
scale is relevant for the temperature dependence of the transmission
coefficient based on the transition state theory. The translational H-bond
breakage is also related to cage-jumps observed in glass-forming liquids, which
mostly involve spatially correlated molecules. Our findings warrant further
exploration of an appropriate free-energy surface or reaction coordinates
beyond the geometrical variables of the water dimer to describe a possible
saddle point related to collective jump motions.

models such as rule sets are more interpretable than other models, and that
among such rule-based models, simpler models are more interpretable than more
complex ones. In this position paper, we question this latter assumption by
focusing on one particular aspect of interpretability, namely the plausibility
of models. Roughly speaking, we equate the plausibility of a model with the
likeliness that a user accepts it as an explanation for a prediction. In
particular, we argue that, all other things being equal, longer explanations
may be more convincing than shorter ones, and that the predominant bias for
shorter models, which is typically necessary for learning powerful
discriminative models, may not be suitable when it comes to user acceptance of
the learned models. To that end, we first recapitulate evidence for and against
this postulate, and then report the results of an evaluation in a
crowd-sourcing study based on about 3.000 judgments. The results do not reveal
a strong preference for simple rules, whereas we can observe a weak preference
for longer rules in some domains. We then relate these results to well-known
cognitive biases such as the conjunction fallacy, the representative heuristic,
or the recogition heuristic, and investigate their relation to rule length and

expectations, time-dependent position probability densities for the coherent

exception: there is a regime of large magnitude of the coherent state
parameter, $z$, where the otherwise indistinct position probability density
separates into $m+1$ distinct wavepackets oscillating and colliding in the
potential, forming interference fringes when they collide. The Mandel $Q$

non-classical behaviour. We plot the position standard deviation and find

children with ASD and 15 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Apart
from fixation and gaze transition, a new longest common subsequence (LCS)
approach was proposed to analyze eye-movement traces. Results revealed that
children with ASD showed deficits of joint attention. Compared to the human
agent, robot facilitate less fixations towards the targets, but it attracted
more attention and allowed the children to show gaze transition and to follow
joint attention logic. This results highlight both potential application of LCS
analysis on eye-tracking studies and of social robot to intervention.

than previously used similar datasets. After fiducial model correction we
obtain the best fit $\Omega_{0m}-\sigma_8$ $\Lambda$CDM parameters and show
that they are at a $5\sigma$ tension with the corresponding
Planck15/$\Lambda$CDM values. Introducing a nontrivial covariance matrix
correlating randomly $20\%$ of the RSD datapoints has no significant effect on
the above tension level. We show that the tension disappears (becomes less than
$1\sigma$) when a subsample of the 20 most recently published data is used. A
partial cause for this reduced tension is the fact that more recent data tend
to probe higher redshifts (with higher errorbars) where there is degeneracy
among different models due to matter domination. Allowing for a nontrivial
evolution of the effective Newton's constant as
$G_{\textrm{eff}}(z)/G_{\textrm{N}} = 1 + g_a \left(\frac{z}{1+z}\right)^2 -
g_a \left(\frac{z}{1+z}\right)^4$ ($g_a$ is a parameter) and fixing a \plcdm

the 20 earliest and 20 latest datapoints imply $g_a=-1.28^{+0.28}_{-0.26}$ and
$g_a=-0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.41}$ respectively. Thus, the more recent $f\sigma_8$
data appear to favor GR in contrast to earlier data. Finally, we show that the
parametrization $f\sigma_8(z)=\lambda \sigma_8 \Omega(z)^\gamma /(1+z)^\beta$
provides an excellent fit to the solution of the growth equation for both GR
($g_a=0$) and modified gravity ($g_a\neq 0$).

  Sequences and 2-Class Joint Degree Matrices","Accepted to SODA 2019",,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The switch Markov chain has been extensively studied as the most natural
Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach for sampling graphs with prescribed degree
sequences. We use comparison arguments with other, less natural but simpler to
analyze, Markov chains, to show that the switch chain mixes rapidly in two
different settings. We first study the classic problem of uniformly sampling
simple undirected, as well as bipartite, graphs with a given degree sequence.
We apply an embedding argument, involving a Markov chain defined by Jerrum and
Sinclair (TCS, 1990) for sampling graphs that almost have a given degree
sequence, to show rapid mixing for degree sequences satisfying strong
stability, a notion closely related to $P$-stability. This results in a much
shorter proof that unifies the currently known rapid mixing results of the
switch chain and extends them up to sharp characterizations of $P$-stability.
In particular, our work resolves an open problem posed by Greenhill (SODA,
2015).
  Secondly, in order to illustrate the power of our approach, we study the
problem of uniformly sampling graphs for which, in addition to the degree
sequence, a joint degree distribution is given. Although the problem was
formalized over a decade ago, and despite its practical significance in
generating synthetic network topologies, small progress has been made on the
random sampling of such graphs. The case of a single degree class reduces to
sampling of regular graphs, but beyond this almost nothing is known. We fully
resolve the case of two degree classes, by showing that the switch Markov chain
is always rapidly mixing. Again, we first analyze an auxiliary chain for
strongly stable instances on an augmented state space and then use an embedding
argument.

A basic method for analysing sound fields recorded using such arrays is steered
response power (SRP) maps wherein the source DOA can be estimated as the
steering direction that maximises the output power of a maximally-directive
beam. This approach is computationally costly since it requires steering the
beam in all possible directions. This paper presents an extension to SRP called
steered response power density (SRPD) and an associated, signal-adaptive search
method called hierarchical grid refinement (HiGRID) for reducing the number of
steering directions needed for DOA estimation. The proposed method can localise
coherent as well as incoherent sources while jointly providing the number of
prominent sources in the scene. It is shown to be robust to reverberation and
additive white noise. An evaluation of the proposed method using simulations

well. Currently, state-of-the-art DNN regularization techniques consist in
randomly dropping units and/or connections on each iteration of the training
algorithm. Dropout and DropConnect are characteristic examples of such
regularizers, that are widely popular among practitioners. However, a drawback
of such approaches consists in the fact that their postulated probability of
random unit/connection omission is a constant that must be heuristically
selected based on the obtained performance in some validation set. To alleviate
this burden, in this paper we regard the DNN regularization problem from a
Bayesian inference perspective: We impose a sparsity-inducing prior over the
network synaptic weights, where the sparsity is induced by a set of
Bernoulli-distributed binary variables with Beta (hyper-)priors over their
prior parameters. This way, we eventually allow for marginalizing over the DNN
synaptic connectivity for output generation, thus giving rise to an effective,
heuristics-free, network regularization scheme. We perform Bayesian inference
for the resulting hierarchical model by means of an efficient Black-Box
Variational inference scheme. We exhibit the advantages of our method over
existing approaches by conducting an extensive experimental evaluation using
benchmark datasets.

exhibit collective growth-rate oscillations mediated by electrochemical
signaling to cope with nutrient starvation. These oscillations emerge once the
colony reaches a large enough number of cells. However, it remains unclear
whether the amplitude of the oscillations, and thus their effectiveness, builds
up over time gradually, or if they can emerge instantly with a non-zero
amplitude. Here we address this question by combining microfluidics-based
time-lapse microscopy experiments with a minimal theoretical description of the
system in the form of a delay-differential equation model. Analytical and
numerical methods reveal that oscillations arise through a subcritical Hopf
bifurcation, which enables instant high amplitude oscillations. Consequently,
the model predicts a bistable regime where an oscillating and a non-oscillating
attractor coexist in phase space. We experimentally validate this prediction by
showing that oscillations can be triggered by perturbing the media conditions,
provided the biofilm size lies within an appropriate range. The model also
predicts that the minimum size at which oscillations start decreases with
stress, a fact that we also verify experimentally. Taken together, our results
show that collective oscillations in cell populations can emerge suddenly with
non-zero amplitude via a discontinuous transition.

Lifshitz scaling at high energies, as it happens in Ho\v{r}ava's proposal for

primordial perturbations generated at inflation. Breaking of 4D diffeomorphism
(Diff) invariance down to the foliation-preserving Diff in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz
(HL) gravity leads to appearance of a scalar degree of freedom in the gravity
sector, khronon, which describes dynamics of the time foliation. One can
naively expect that mixing between inflaton and khronon will jeopardize
conservation of adiabatic perturbations at super Hubble scales. This indeed
happens in the projectable version of the theory. By contrast, we find that in
the non-projectable version of HL gravity, khronon acquires an effective mass
which is much larger than the Hubble scale well before the Hubble crossing time
and decouples from the adiabatic curvature perturbation $\zeta$ sourced by the
inflaton fluctuations. As a result, at super Hubble scales the adiabatic
perturbation $\zeta$ behaves as in an effectively single field system and its
spectrum is conserved in time. Lifshitz scaling is imprinted in the power
spectrum of $\zeta$ through the modified dispersion relation of the inflaton.
We point out violation of the consistency relation between the tensor-to-scalar
ratio and the spectral tilt of primordial gravitational waves and suggest that
it can provide a signal of Lorentz violation in inflationary era.

i.e., the coronal mass ejections (CMEs), on the Sun, and magnetic clouds are
post-eruption MFRs in interplanetary space. There is a strong debate about
whether or not a MFR exists prior to a CME and how the MFR forms/grows through
magnetic reconnection during the eruption. Here we report a rare event, in
which a magnetic cloud was observed sequentially by four spacecraft near
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, respectively. With the aids of a uniform-twist
flux rope model and a newly developed method that can recover a
shock-compressed structure, we find that the axial magnetic flux and helicity
of the magnetic cloud decreased when it propagated outward but the twist
increased. Our analysis suggests that the `pancaking' effect and `erosion'
effect may jointly cause such variations. The significance of the `pancaking'
effect is difficult to be estimated, but the signature of the erosion can be
found as the imbalance of the azimuthal flux of the cloud. The latter implies
that the magnetic cloud was eroded significantly leaving its inner core exposed
to the solar wind at far distance. The increase of the twist together with the
presence of the erosion effect suggests that the post-eruption MFR may have a
high-twist core enveloped by a less-twisted outer shell. These results pose a
great challenge to the current understanding on the solar eruptions as well as
the formation and instability of MFRs.

coupled that one obtains a more coherent description by treating them together.
We carry out theoretical and computational studies of a series of well-known
polyatomic ions, namely sulfate, nitrate and acetate ions. All the three ions
exhibit different rotational diffusivity, with that of nitrate ion being
considerably larger than the other two. They all defy the hydrodynamic laws of
size dependence. Study of the local structure around the ions provides valuable
insight into the origin of these differences. We carry out a detailed study of
the rotational diffusion of these ions by extensive computer simulation and
using the theoretical approaches of the dielectric friction developed by

determine the value of each other. The RISM-based MCT suggests an interesting

for new ultra-fast and highly reliable coding techniques for data at rest and

most important design requirements. The simplest way of providing a degree of
reliability is by using data replication techniques. However, replication is
highly inefficient in terms of capacity utilization. Erasure coding has
therefore become a viable alternative to replication since it provides the same
level of reliability as replication with significantly less storage overhead.
The present thesis investigates efficient constructions of erasure codes for
different applications. Methods from both coding and information theory have
been applied to network coding, Optical Packet Switching (OPS) networks and
distributed storage systems. The following four issues are addressed: -
Construction of binary and non-binary erasure codes; - Reduction of the header
overhead due to the encoding coefficients in network coding; - Construction and
implementation of new erasure codes for large-scale distributed storage systems
that provide savings in the storage and network resources compared to
state-of-the-art codes; and - Provision of a unified view on Quality of Service

spatially-explicit individual-based modeling of ecological systems, with the
notion of a policy. A policy is an entity for specifying orderings between the
different activities within a system. It is defined externally to a PALPS model
as a partial order which prescribes the precedence order between the activities
of the individu- als of which the model is comprised. The motivation for
introducing policies is twofold: one the one hand, policies can help to reduce
the state-space of a model, on the other hand, they are useful for exploring
the behavior of an ecosystem under different assumptions on the ordering of
events within the system. To take account of policies, we refine the semantics
of PALPS via a transition relation which prunes away executions that do not
respect the defined policy. Furthermore, we propose a translation of PALPS into
the probabilistic model checker PRISM . We illustrate our framework by applying
PRISM on PALPS models with policies for conducting simulation and reachability
analysis.

accurate approximation of the instantaneous secrecy rate. Using this
approximation, it is shown that in some wiretap settings under antenna
selection the growth in the number of active antennas enhances the secrecy
performance of the system up to some optimal number and degrades it when this
optimal number is surpassed. This observation demonstrates that antenna
selection in some massive MIMO settings not only reduces the RF-complexity, but
also enhances the secrecy performance. We then consider various scenarios and
derive the optimal number of active antennas analytically using our
large-system approximation. Numerical investigations show an accurate match

parameters of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women, with focus on the
clinical aspects of the mathematical modeling.
  Method: Several patients' data are extracted from UPP and urodynamic
documents and their relation and affinities are modeled using an artificial
neural network (ANN) model. The studied parameter is urethral pressure as a
function of two variables: the age of the patient and the position in which the
pressure was measured across the urethra (normalized length).
  Results: The ANN-generated surface, showing the relation between the chosen
parameters and the urethral pressure in the studied patients, is more efficient
than the surface generated by conventional mathematical methods for clinical
analysis, with multi-sample analysis being obtained. For example, in elderly
people, there are many low-pressure zones throughout the urethra length,
indicating that there is more incontinence in old age.
  Conclusion: The predictions of urethral pressure made by the trained neural
network model in relation to the studied effective parameters can be used to
build a medical assistance system in order to help clinicians diagnose urinary
incontinence problems more efficiently.

behind observed actions, with history plan libraries or domain models in hand.
Previous approaches either discover plans by maximally ""matching"" observed
actions to plan libraries, assuming target plans are from plan libraries, or
infer plans by executing domain models to best explain the observed actions,
assuming that complete domain models are available. In real world applications,
however, target plans are often not from plan libraries, and complete domain
models are often not available, since building complete sets of plans and
complete domain models are often difficult or expensive. In this paper we view
plan libraries as corpora and learn vector representations of actions using the
corpora, we then discover target plans based on the vector representations.
Specifically, we propose two approaches, DUP and RNNPlanner, to discover target
plans based on vector representations of actions. DUP explores the EM-style
framework to capture local contexts of actions and discover target plans by
optimizing the probability of target plans, while RNNPlanner aims to leverage
long-short term contexts of actions based on RNNs (recurrent neural networks)
framework to help recognize target plans. In the experiments, we empirically
show that our approaches are capable of discovering underlying plans that are
not from plan libraries, without requiring domain models provided. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing its performance to
traditional plan recognition approaches in three planning domains. We also
compare DUP and RNNPlanner to see their advantages and disadvantages.

double directional (DD) channel model for downlink channel estimation. This
combination strikes a good balance between high-capacity communications and
parsimonious channel modeling, and also brings limited feedback schemes for
downlink channel estimation within reach. However, most existing channel
estimation work under the DD model has not considered DP arrays, perhaps
because of the complex array manifold and the resulting difficulty in algorithm
design. In this paper, we first reveal that the DD channel with DP arrays at
the transmitter and receiver can be naturally modeled as a low-rank four-way
tensor, and thus the parameters can be effectively estimated via tensor
decomposition algorithms. To reduce computational complexity, we show that the
problem can be recast as a four-snapshot three-dimensional harmonic retrieval
problem, which can be solved using computationally efficient subspace methods.
On the theory side, we show that the DD channel with DP arrays is identifiable
under very mild conditions, leveraging identifiability of low-rank tensors.
Numerical simulations are employed to showcase the effectiveness of our
methods.
