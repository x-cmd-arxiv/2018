be used to model DNA methylation data. The standard algorithm for the problem
is EM, which is computationally expensive for sequences of the scale of the
mammalian genome. Recently developed spectral algorithms can learn parameters
of latent variable models via tensor decomposition, and are highly efficient
for large data. However, these methods have only been applied to categorial
HMMs, and the main challenge is how to extend them to Binomial HMMs while still
retaining computational efficiency. We address this challenge by introducing a
new feature-map based approach that exploits specific properties of Binomial
HMMs. We provide theoretical performance guarantees for our algorithm and
evaluate it on real DNA methylation data.

the coarse median universe from the perspective of intervals, with a particular
focus on cardinality as a proxy for distance. In particular we prove that the
metric on a quasi-geodesic coarse median space of bounded geometry can be
constructed up to quasi-isometry using only the coarse median operator. Finally
we develop a concept of rank for coarse median algebras in terms of the
geometry of intervals and show that the notion of finite rank coarse median
algebra provides a natural higher dimensional analogue of Gromov's concept of
$\delta$-hyperbolicity.

a different underlying model. Unlike statistical cohorts, these subpopulations

their associated models are interpretable, modeling leads to insights about the
subpopulations and their associations with the regression target. We introduce
a discriminative model that simultaneously learns cadre assignment and
target-prediction rules. Sparsity-inducing priors are placed on the model
parameters, under which independent feature selection is performed for both the
cadre assignment and target-prediction processes. We learn models using
adaptive step size stochastic gradient descent, and we assess cadre quality
with bootstrapped sample analysis. We present simulated results showing that,
when the true clustering rule does not depend on the entire set of features,
our method significantly outperforms methods that learn subpopulation-discovery
and target-prediction rules separately. In a materials-by-design case study,
our model provides state-of-the-art prediction of polymer glass transition
temperature. Importantly, the method identifies cadres of polymers that respond
differently to structural perturbations, thus providing design insight for
targeting or avoiding specific transition temperature ranges. It identifies
chemically meaningful cadres, each with interpretable models. Further
experimental results show that cadre methods have generalization that is
competitive with linear and nonlinear regression models and can identify robust
subpopulations.

dielectric screening properties of vdW heterostructures (vdWHs) formed by MoS2

in the MoS2/Graphene vdWHs under different directions of the external electric
field. That is, when the electric fields are shed towards graphene, a large
amount of polarized charges screen the fields, but as the sign of the field was
reversed, a strong depolarization field was present, and a partial screening
was detected. This effect is thickness-dependent, in particular on the number
of the MoS2 layers; whereas increased thickness of graphene showed a small
effect on their electrical and screening behavior. Our results indicate that
asymmetric dipolar contributions at the interface between graphene and MoS2 are
the main cause to the unusual field-effect screening in the vdWHs. This work
not only provides new insights on the screening properties of a vast amount of

The goal of uncertainty would be to rate-limit actions of potential malware
during the time consuming deep analysis. In this paper, we present a detailed
description of the analysis and implementation of CHAMELEON, a framework for
realizing this uncertain environment for Linux. CHAMELEON offers two
environments for software: (i) standard - for any software identified as benign
by conventional machine learning methods and (ii) uncertain - for software
receiving borderline classifications when analyzed by these conventional
machine learning methods. The uncertain environment adds obstacles to software
execution through random perturbations applied probabilistically on selected
system calls. We evaluated CHAMELEON with 113 applications and 100 malware
samples for Linux. Our results showed that at threshold 10%, intrusive and
non-intrusive strategies caused approximately 65% of malware to fail
accomplishing their tasks, while approximately 30% of the analyzed benign
software to meet with various levels of disruption. With a dynamic, per-system

the benign software to be disrupted. We also found that I/O-bound software was
three times more affected by uncertainty than CPU-bound software. Further, we
analyzed the logs of software crashed with non-intrusive strategies, and found

the idea, although it is not new, that these changes in Physics cannot be
reduced to a point-like event, but happened instead through multiple successive

arises either spontaneously (aka \emph{uniform initialization}), or during

only a few examples of strong amplifiers were known for uniform initialization,

  In this work, we study necessary and sufficient conditions for strong

temperature initialization, graphs that are unweighted and/or self-loop-free

$g(r,c)$ a function linear in $r$. Our main positive result complements these
negative results, and is as follows: every family of undirected graphs with
(i)~self loops and (ii)~diameter bounded by $n^{1-\epsilon}$, for some fixed
$\epsilon>0$, can be assigned weights that makes it a strong amplifier, both

force field by comparing simulation results to that of the experimental
findings. Nevertheless, we discover that the non-planar tautomeric form is the

molecules and its solvation dynamics show unique features. Because of an
extended positive charge distribution, metformin possesses features of being a
permanent cationic partner toward several targets. We study its interaction and
binding ability with DNA using UV spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorimetry
and metadynamics simulation. We find a non-intercalating mode of interaction.
Metformin feasibly forms a minor/major groove-bound state within a few tens of

in the path integral. We explore the case of the Ising model coupled to the 2d
discrete Einstein Hilbert action, restricted to the 2d orders. We probe the
phase diagram in terms of the Wick rotation parameter \b{eta} and the Ising
coupling j and find that the matter and the causal sets together give rise to
an interesting phase structure. The couplings give rise to five different
phases. The causal sets take on random or crystalline characteristics as
described in [1] and the Ising model can be correlated or uncorrelated on the
random ordes and correlated, uncorrelated or anti-correlated on the crystalline
orders. We find that at least one new phase transition arises, in which the
Ising spins push the causal set into the crystalline phase.

recently been thoroughly studied in computational biology as it is less
restrictive than the well known binary perfect phylogeny. Here, we focus on the
notion of (binary) persistent characters, i.e. characters that can be realized
on a phylogenetic tree by at most one $0 \rightarrow 1$ transition followed by
at most one $1 \rightarrow 0$ transition in the tree, and analyze these
characters under different aspects. First, we illustrate the connection between
persistent characters and Maximum Parsimony, where we characterize persistent
characters in terms of the first phase of the famous Fitch algorithm.
Afterwards we focus on the number of persistent characters for a given
phylogenetic tree. We show that this number solely depends on the balance of
the tree. To be precise, we develop a formula for counting the number of
persistent characters for a given phylogenetic tree based on an index of tree
balance, namely the Sackin index. Lastly, we consider the question of how many
(carefully chosen) binary characters together with their persistence status are
needed to uniquely determine a phylogenetic tree and provide an upper bound for
the number of characters needed.

derived, including new computations of the fixed point indices of isolated

  Our approach exploits certain attractor-repeller decomposition of the
unstable manifold, reducing the study of the cohomological Conley index to the
relation between the cohomology of an attractor and its basin of attraction.
This is a classical problem that, in the present case, is particularly
difficult because the dynamics is discrete and the topology of the unstable
manifold can be very complicated. To address it we develop a new method that
may be of independent interest and involves the summation of power series in
cohomology: if $Z$ is a metric space and $K \subseteq Z$ is a compact, global
attractor for a continuous map $g \colon Z \to Z$, we show how to interpret

strategic limitation of scope in the 3D space, or the application of lossy

we present a mapping algorithm that converts 3D structures to 2D and 1D data
grids by mapping a traversal of a 3D space-filling curve to the traversal of
corresponding 2D and 1D curves. We explore the performance of 2D and 1D CNNs
trained on data encoded with our method versus comparable volumetric CNNs
operating upon raw 3D data from a popular benchmarking dataset. Our experiments
demonstrate that both 2D and 1D representations of 3D data generated via our
method preserve a significant proportion of the 3D data's features in forms
learnable by CNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method of encoding 3D
data into lower-dimensional representations allows for decreased CNN training
time cost, increased original 3D model rendering resolutions, and supports
increased numbers of data channels when compared to purely volumetric
approaches. This demonstration is accomplished in the context of a structural
biology classification task wherein we train 3D, 2D, and 1D CNNs on examples of

terms of their (approximate) expected prediction error or the so-called Area
Under the Curve (AUC) for a particular data distribution. However, when the
models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization, surrogate
functions such as the logistic loss are optimized instead. This is done because
the empirical approximations of the expected error and AUC functions are
nonconvex and nonsmooth, and more importantly have zero derivative almost
everywhere. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, and
under the assumption that the data has normal distribution, the expected error
and the expected AUC are not only smooth, but have closed form expressions,
which depend on the first and second moments of the normal distribution. Hence,
we derive derivatives of these two functions and use these derivatives in an
optimization algorithm to directly optimize the expected error and the AUC. In
the case of real data sets, the derivatives can be approximated using empirical
moments. We show that even when data is not normally distributed, computed
derivatives are sufficiently useful to render an efficient optimization method
and high quality solutions. Thus, we propose a gradient-based optimization
method for direct optimization of the prediction error and AUC. Moreover, the
per-iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm has no dependence on the
size of the data set, unlike those for optimizing logistic regression and all
other well known empirical risk minimization problems.

exhibits intriguing sliding behavior, which reveals itself in the frequency

on physics of 2D CDWs, there have been few reports of CDW sliding, specifically
in quasi-2D rare-earth tritellurides and none on the noise in any of 2D CDW

on 1T-TaS2 thin films - archetypal 2D CDW systems, as they are driven from the
nearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phases by voltage and
temperature stimuli. We have found that noise in 1T-TaS2 devices has two
pronounced maxima at the bias voltages, which correspond to the onset of CDW
sliding and the NC-to-IC phase transition. We observed unusual Lorentzian noise
features and exceptionally strong noise dependence on electric bias and
temperature. We argue that LFN in 2D CDW systems has unique physical origin,
different from known fundamental noise types. The specifics of LFN in 2D CDW

analysis of these theories with the aim of (i) understanding whether or not
these are actually equivalent to general relativity, and (ii) finding the root
of the variance in case these are not. We have found that a broad set of
seemingly different theories actually pass all the possible tests of
equivalence to general relativity (in vacuum) that we were able to devise,
including the analysis of scattering amplitudes using on-shell techniques.
These results are complemented with the observation that the only examples
which are manifestly not equivalent to general relativity either do not contain
gravitons in their spectrum, or are not guaranteed to include only two local
degrees of freedom once radiative corrections are taken into account. Coupling
to matter is also considered: we show that coupling these theories to matter in
a consistent way is not as straightforward as one could expect. Minimal
coupling, as well as the most straightforward non-minimal couplings, cannot be
used. Therefore, before being able to address any issues in the presence of

The numerical MCT solver is showcased in a supersonic turbulent flow with Mach
2.93 over an $8^{\circ}$ compression ramp. The simulation results validated MCT
with experiments as an alternative for modeling compressible turbulence. The
required size of the smallest mesh cell for the MCT simulation is shown to be
almost an order larger than that in a similar DNS study. The comparison shows
MCT is a much more computationally friendly theory than the classical NS
equations. The dynamics of energy cascade at the length-scale of individual
eddies is illuminated through the subscale rotation introduced by MCT. In this
regard, MCT provides a statistical averaging procedure for capturing energy
transfer in compressible turbulence, not found in classical fluid theories.
Analysis of the MCT results show the existence of a statistical coupling of the
internal and translational kinetic energy fluctuations with the corresponding
eddy rotational energy fluctuations, indicating a multiscale transfer of
energy. In conclusion, MCT gives a new characterization of the energy cascade
within compressible turbulence without the use of excessive computational

supergiants have shed new light on a previous puzzle involving a prominent
member of the class: Alpha Persei (HD20902: F5Ib). The warm supergiant is a
moderately strong, hard coronal (T~10MK) X-ray source, but has ten times weaker
""sub-coronal"" Si IV 139 nm (T~80,000 K) emissions than early-G supergiants of
similar high-energy properties. The Alpha Per X-ray excess speculatively was
ascribed to a close-in hyperactive G-dwarf companion, which could have escaped
previous notice, lost in the glare of the bright star. However, a subsequent
dedicated multi-wavelength imaging campaign failed to find any evidence for a
resolved secondary. The origin of the Alpha Per high-energy dichotomy then
devolved to: (1) an unresolved companion; or (2) intrinsic coronal behavior.
Exploring the second possibility, the present program has found that early-F
supergiants do appear to belong to a distinct coronal class, characterized by
elevated X-ray/FUV ratios, although sharing some similarities with Cepheid
variables in their transitory X-ray ""high states."" Remarkably, the early-F
supergiants now are seen to align with the low-activity end of the X-ray/FUV
sequence defined by late-type dwarfs, suggesting that the disjoint behavior
relative to the G supergiants might be attributed to thinner outer atmospheres
on the F types, as in dwarfs, but in this case perhaps caused by a weakened
""ionization valve"" effect due to overly warm photospheres.

by comparing the first quantitative measurements of the raft morphology to a
theoretical continuous elastic model of the interface. We show that although
powerful to describe the wrinkle wavelength, the wrinkle-to-fold transition and
the fold shape, this elastic description does not capture the finer details of
the experiment. We describe an unpredicted secondary wavelength, a compression
discrepancy with the model and a hysteretic behavior during compression cycles,

granular rafts. It suggests also that these composite materials exhibit both

convergence analysis for a typical type of stochastic optimisation methods:
proximal variance reduced stochastic gradient methods, and mainly focus on the
SAGA [12] and Prox-SVRG [43] algorithms. Under the assumption that the
non-smooth component of the optimisation problem is partly smooth relative to a

SAGA/Prox-SVRG are able to identify the smooth manifold in a finite number of
iterations; (ii) then the sequence enters a local linear convergence regime.
Beyond local convergence analysis, we also discuss various possibilities for
accelerating these algorithms, including adapting to better local parameters,
and applying higher-order deterministic/stochastic optimisation methods which
can achieve super-linear convergence. Concrete examples arising from machine
learning are considered to verify the obtained results.

that achieve a minimal type II error while enforcing the prioritized type I
error controlled under some user-specified level $\alpha$. This paradigm serves
naturally in applications such as severe disease diagnosis and spam detection,
where people have clear priorities among the two error types. Recently, Tong,
Feng and Li (2018) proposed a nonparametric umbrella algorithm that adapts all
scoring-type classification methods (e.g., logistic regression, support vector
machines, random forest) to respect the given type I error upper bound $\alpha$
with high probability, without specific distributional assumptions on the
features and the responses. Universal the umbrella algorithm is, it demands an
explicit minimum sample size requirement on class $0$, which is often the more
scarce class, such as in rare disease diagnosis applications. In this work, we
employ the parametric linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model and propose a
new parametric thresholding algorithm, which does not need the minimum sample
size requirements on class $0$ observations and thus is suitable for small
sample applications such as rare disease diagnosis. Leveraging both the
existing nonparametric and the newly proposed parametric thresholding rules, we
propose four LDA-based NP classifiers, for both low- and high-dimensional
settings. On the theoretical front, we prove NP oracle inequalities for one
proposed classifier, where the rate for excess type II error benefits from the
explicit parametric model assumption. Furthermore, as NP classifiers involve a
sample splitting step of class $0$ observations, we construct a new adaptive
sample splitting scheme that can be applied universally to NP classifiers, and
this adaptive strategy reduces the type II error of these classifiers.

classification methods minimize the overall classification error and may yield
an undesirably large type I error (relevant textual messages are classified as
irrelevant), particularly when available data exhibit an asymmetry between
relevant and irrelevant information. Data distortion exacerbates this situation
and often leads to fallacious prediction. To deal with inestimable data
distortion, we propose the use of the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification
paradigm, which minimizes type II error under a user-specified type I error
constraint. Theoretically, we show that the NP oracle is unaffected by data
distortion when the class conditional distributions remain the same.
Empirically, we study a case of classifying posts about worker strikes obtained
from a leading Chinese microblogging platform, which are frequently prone to
extensive, unpredictable and inestimable censorship. We demonstrate that, even
though the training and test data are susceptible to different distortion and
therefore potentially follow different distributions, our proposed NP methods
control the type I error on test data at the targeted level. The methods and
implementation pipeline proposed in our case study are applicable to many other
problems involving data distortion.

temperatures of 200...450 $\deg$C. While cooling to working temperature after
bonding happened pieces are mutually deformed. Due to linear thermal expansion
coefficients mismatch of anodically bonded glass and silicon samples an
internal stress state is generated. Such stresses are called thermal mismatch
stresses. The aim of this paper is a determination of technological and design
solutions to achieve minimal thermal mismatch stresses in resulting bond.
  The nonlinear dependence of linear thermal expansion coefficients of bonded
samples' materials on temperature makes it difficult to minimize thermal
mismatch stresses by chosing materials with close average thermal expansion
coefficients in particular temperature range. To assess means of lowering
thermal mismatch stress in this paper two different ways to describe assembly
are used: two thin bonded layers and multilayered composite material.
  Based on properties of two brands of glass (LK5, Borofloat 33) and silicon
used with described mathematical models thermal mismatch stresses at
temperature $T_w$ in samples bonded at several different temperatures $T_b$ are
evaluated. Bonded silicon surface stress dependence of glass to silicon wafer
thickness ratio is evaluated. Based on such evaluations one can say that by
varying thickness of glass bonded to silicon one can obtain zero thermal
mismatch stress at a particular depth of material or obtain stress of some
defined value at this depth.
  Models of assembly description used in this paper can be used to optimize
anodic bonding process parameters. Such usage aimed to minimize thermal
mismatch stresses at device working temperatures is presented in this paper.

when a voter's preferences on some questions or proposals depend on the
predicted outcomes of others. The notion of separability formalizes the study
of interdependence in multidimensional preferences, and the character
admissibility problem deals with the construction of voter preferences with
given separability structures. In this paper, we develop a graph theoretic
approach to the character admissibilty problem, using Hamiltonian paths to
generate voter preferences. We apply this method specifically to the hypercube
graph, defining the class of cubic preferences. We then explore how the
algebraic structure of the group of symmetries of the hypercube impacts the
separability structures exhibited by cubic preferences. We prove that the
characters of cubic preferences satisfy set theoretic properties distinct from
those produced by previous methods, and we define two functions to construct
cubic preferences. Our results have potential applications to experimental work

Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable

natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric
language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of
neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and
fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis' modularity
and utility with two applications supporting structured and free-form querying.
The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy
icons from privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4%
on this task. The second application, PriBot, is the first freeform
question-answering system for privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce
a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. Using
an MTurk user study with 700 participants, we show that at least one of

many optimal solutions may exist to a given matching problem, when the elements
that shall or not be included in a solution correspond to individuals, it
becomes of paramount importance that the solution be selected fairly. In this
paper we study individual fairness in matching problems. Given that many
maximum matchings may exist, each one satisfying a different set of
individuals, the only way to guarantee fairness is through randomization. Hence
we introduce the distributional maxmin fairness framework which provides, for
any given input instance, the strongest guarantee possible simultaneously for
all individuals in terms of satisfaction probability (the probability of being
matched in the solution). Specifically, a probability distribution over
feasible solutions is maxmin-fair if it is not possible to improve the
satisfaction probability of any individual without decreasing it for some other
individual which is no better off. In the special case of matchings in
bipartite graphs, our framework is equivalent to the egalitarian mechanism of
Bogomolnaia and Mouline. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm
for fair matching building on techniques from minimum cuts, and edge-coloring
algorithms for regular bipartite graphs, and transversal theory. For bipartite

hundreds of millions of edges. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the

networks. In flux balance analysis, reaction rates and optimal pathways are
ascertained by solving a linear program, in which the growth rate is maximized
subject to mass-balance constraints. A variety of cell functions in response to
environmental stimuli can be quantified using flux balance analysis by
parameterizing the linear program with respect to extracellular conditions.
However, for most large, genome-scale metabolic networks of practical interest,
the resulting parametric problem has multiple and highly degenerate optimal
solutions, which are computationally challenging to handle. An improved
multi-parametric programming algorithm based on active-set methods is
introduced in this paper to overcome these computational difficulties.
Degeneracy and multiplicity are handled, respectively, by introducing
generalized inverses and auxiliary objective functions into the formulation of
the optimality conditions. These improvements are especially effective for
metabolic networks because their stoichiometry matrices are generally sparse;
thus, fast and efficient algorithms from sparse linear algebra can be leveraged
to compute generalized inverses and null-space bases. We illustrate the
application of our algorithm to flux balance analysis of metabolic networks by
studying a reduced metabolic model of Corynebacterium glutamicum and a
genome-scale model of Escherichia coli. We then demonstrate how the critical
regions resulting from these studies can be associated with optimal metabolic
modes and discuss the physical relevance of optimal pathways arising from
various auxiliary objective functions. Achieving more than five-fold
improvement in computational speed over existing multi-parametric programming
tools, the proposed algorithm proves promising in handling genome-scale
metabolic models.

software-provided resource specification and resource management in hardware
leads to significant challenges in programming ease, portability, and
performance, as we demonstrate in this work.
  Our goal in this work is to reduce the dependence of performance on the
software-provided resource specification to simultaneously alleviate the above
challenges. To this end, we introduce Zorua, a new resource virtualization
framework, that decouples the programmer-specified resource usage of a GPU
application from the actual allocation in the on-chip hardware resources. Zorua
enables this decoupling by virtualizing each resource transparently to the

physically available, Zorua offers several important benefits: (i) Programming
Ease: Zorua eases the burden on the programmer to provide code that is tuned to
efficiently utilize the physically available on-chip resources. (ii)
Portability: Zorua alleviates the necessity of re-tuning an application's
resource usage when porting the application across GPU generations. (iii)
Performance: By dynamically allocating resources and carefully oversubscribing
them when necessary, Zorua improves or retains the performance of applications
that are already highly tuned to best utilize the resources. The holistic

stellar models are known to be a limiting factor in such studies, and thus it
is uncertain to what extent the observed diversity of stellar abundance
patterns is real. Here we report the abundances of 30 elements with precisions

information to the commonly studied two-point correlation function (2PCF) about
the morphology of ionized regions. We investigate the 21cm 2PCF and 3PCF in
configuration space using semi-numerical simulations and test whether they can
be described by the local quadratic bias model. We find that fits of bias model
predictions for the 2PCF and 3PCF deviate from our measurements by $\sim 20\%$
at scales above the typical size of ionized regions ($\simeq 30$ Mpc) and at
early times with global neutral fractions of $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle
\gtrsim 0.7$. At later times and smaller scales these deviations increase
strongly, indicating a break down of the bias model. The 2PCF and 3PCF fits of
the linear bias parameter agree at the $10\%$ level for different EoR model
configurations. This agreement holds, when adding redshift space distortions to
the simulations. The relation between spatial fluctuations in the matter
density and the 21cm signal, as predicted by the bias model, is consistent with
direct measurements of this relation in simulations for large smoothing scales
($\gtrsim 30$ Mpc). From this latter test we conclude that negative amplitudes
of the 21cm 3PCF result from negative bias parameters, which describe the
anti-correlation between the matter over-densities and the 21cm signal during

found to preferentially align in significantly flattened planes of satellite
galaxies, and available velocity measurements are indicative of a preference of
satellites in those structures to co-orbit. There is increasing evidence that
such kinematically correlated satellite planes are also present around more
distant hosts. Detailed comparisons show that similarly anisotropic phase-space
distributions of sub-halos are exceedingly rare in cosmological simulations
based on the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Analogs to the observed systems have
frequencies of $\leq 0.5$ per cent in such simulations. In contrast to other
small-scale problems, the satellite planes issue is not strongly affected by
baryonic processes because the distribution of sub-halos on scales of hundreds
of kpc is dominated by gravitational effects. This makes the satellite planes
one of the most serious small-scale problem for $\Lambda$CDM. This review
summarizes the observational evidence for planes of satellite galaxies in the
Local Group and beyond, and provides an overview of how they compare to
cosmological simulations. It also discusses scenarios which aim at explaining
the coherence of satellite positions and orbits, and why they all are currently
unable to satisfactorily resolve the issue.

matter bias parameters using correlation functions in a fully data driven and
self-consistent manner. Unlike other machine learning, template, or correlation
redshift methods, this approach does not require a reference sample with known
redshifts. By measuring the projected cross- and auto- correlations of
different galaxy sub-samples, e.g., as chosen by simple cells in
color-magnitude space, we are able to estimate the galaxy-dark matter bias
model parameters, and the shape of the redshift distributions of each
sub-sample. This method fully marginalises over a flexible parameterisation of
the redshift distribution and galaxy-dark matter bias parameters of sub-samples
of galaxies, and thus provides a general Bayesian framework to incorporate
redshift uncertainty into the cosmological analysis in a data-driven,
consistent, and reproducible manner. This result is improved by an order of
magnitude by including cross-correlations with the CMB and with galaxy-galaxy
lensing.
  We showcase how this method could be applied to real galaxies. By using
idealised data vectors, in which all galaxy-dark matter model parameters and
redshift distributions are known, this method is demonstrated to recover
unbiased estimates on important quantities, such as the offset $\Delta_z$
between the mean of the true and estimated redshift distribution and the 68\%
and 95\% and 99.5\% widths of the redshift distribution to an accuracy required
by current and future surveys.

consequence of the fact that deep HI observations typically probe to a lower
mass surface density than visible wavelength data. This paper presents low
surface brightness optimized visible wavelength observations of the extreme
outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2841. We report the discovery of an
enormous low-surface brightness stellar disk in this object. When azimuthally
averaged, the stellar disk can be traced out to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc (5
$R_{25}$ or 23 inner disk scale lengths). The structure in the stellar disk
traces the morphology of HI emission and extended UV emission. Contrary to
expectations, the stellar mass surface density does not fall below that of the
gas mass surface density at any radius. In fact, at all radii greater than
$\sim$20 kpc, the ratio of the stellar to gas mass surface density is a
constant 3:1. Beyond $\sim$30 kpc, the low surface brightness stellar disk
begins to warp, which may be an indication of a physical connection between the
outskirts of the galaxy and infall from the circumgalactic medium. A
combination of stellar migration, accretion and in-situ star formation might be
responsible for building up the outer stellar disk, but whatever mechanisms
formed the outer disk must also explain the constant ratio between stellar and

topological and follows a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence of
higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host
topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected
against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the
three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal.

interstellar medium and in protoplanetary disks. Recently there has been much
debate about the utility of CO as a mass tracer in disks. Observations of CO in
protoplanetary disks reveal a range of CO abundances, with measurements of low
CO to dust mass ratios in numerous systems. One possibility is that carbon is
removed from CO via chemistry. However, the full range of physical conditions
conducive to this chemical reprocessing is not well understood. We perform a
systematic survey of the time dependent chemistry in protoplanetary disks for
198 models with a range of physical conditions. We varying dust grain size
distribution, temperature, comic ray and X-ray ionization rate, disk mass, and
initial water abundance, detailing what physical conditions are necessary to
activate the various CO depletion mechanisms in the warm molecular layer. We
focus our analysis on the warm molecular layer in two regions: the outer disk
(100 au) well outside the CO snowline and the inner disk (19 au) just inside
the midplane CO snow line. After 1 Myr, we find that the majority of models
have a CO abundance relative to H$_2$ less than $10^{-4}$ in the outer disk,
while an abundance less than $10^{-5}$ requires the presence of cosmic rays.
Inside the CO snow line, significant depletion of CO only occurs in models with
a high cosmic ray rate. If cosmic rays are not present in young disks it is
difficult to chemically remove carbon from CO. Additionally, removing water
prior to CO depletion impedes the chemical processing of CO. Chemical
processing alone cannot explain current observations of low CO abundances.
Other mechanisms must also be involved.

J1810+1744 at low radio frequencies. Using LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope observations between 2011--2015 we have
measured variations in flux density, dispersion measure and scattering around
eclipses. High-time-resolution, simultaneous beamformed and interferometric
imaging LOFAR observations show concurrent disappearance of pulsations and
total flux from the source during the eclipses, with a $3\sigma$ upper limit of
36 mJy ($<10\%$ of the pulsar's averaged out-of-eclipse flux density). The
dispersion measure variations are highly asymmetric, suggesting a tail of
material swept back due to orbital motion. The egress deviations are variable
on timescales shorter than the 3.6 hr orbital period and are indicative of a
clumpy medium. Additional pulse broadening detected during egress is typically
$<20\%$ of the pulsar's spin period, showing no evidence of scattering the
pulses beyond detectability in the beamformed data. The eclipses, lasting
$\sim13\%$ of the orbit at 149 MHz, are shown to be frequency-dependent with
total duration scaling as $\propto\nu^{-0.41\pm0.03}$. The results are
discussed in the context of the physical parameters of the system, and an
examination of eclipse mechanisms reveals cyclotron-synchrotron absorption as
the most likely primary cause, although non-linear scattering mechanisms cannot
be quantitatively ruled out. The inferred mass loss rate is a similar
order-of-magnitude to the mean rate required to fully evaporate the companion
in a Hubble time.

assembly of radicals and strokes, but they rely on manual definition of the key
points, which is still time-costing. Some recent work on computer vision
proposes a brand new approach: to treat every Chinese character as an
independent and inseparable image, so the pre-processing and post-processing of
each character can be avoided. Then with a combination of a transfer network
and a discriminating network, one typography can be well transferred to
another. Despite the quite satisfying performance of the model, the training
process requires to be supervised, which means in the training data each
character in the source domain and the target domain needs to be perfectly
paired. Sometimes the pairing is time-costing, and sometimes there is no
perfect pairing, such as the pairing between traditional Chinese and simplified
Chinese characters. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised typography
transfer method which doesn't need pairing.

chain with $n$ sites and local dimension $d$ is by means of the Cayley
hyperdeterminant. The latter quantity is a polynomial constructed with the
components of the wave function $\psi_{i_1, \dots, i_n}$ which is invariant
under local unitary transformation. For spin 1/2 chains (i.e. $d=2$) with $n=2$
and $n=3$ sites, the hyperdeterminant coincides with the concurrence and the
tangle respectively. In this paper we consider spin chains with $n=4$ sites
where the hyperdeterminant is a polynomial of degree 24 containing around $2.8
\times 10^6$ terms. This huge object can be written in terms of more simple
polynomials $S$ and $T$ of degrees 8 and 12 respectively. In this paper we
compute $S$, $T$ and the hyperdeterminant for eigenstates of the following spin
chain Hamiltonians: the transverse Ising model, the XXZ Heisenberg model and
the Haldane-Shastry model. Those invariants are also computed for random
states, the ground states of random matrix Hamiltonians in the Wigner-Dyson
Gaussian ensembles and the quadripartite entangled states defined by Verstraete
et al. in 2002. Finally, we propose a generalization of the hyperdeterminant to
thermal density matrices. We observe how these polynomials are able to capture
the phase transitions present in the models studied as well as a subclass of

topological insulators is of significant interest since it enables the
exploration of new topological physics with photons, and promises novel
photonic devices that are robust against disorders in three dimensions.
Previous theoretical proposals towards three dimensional topological insulators
utilize complex geometries that are challenging to implement. Here, based on
the concept of synthetic dimension, we show that a two-dimensional array of
ring resonators, which was previously demonstrated to exhibit a two-dimensional
topological insulator phase, in fact automatically becomes a three-dimensional
topological insulator, when the frequency dimension is taken into account.
Moreover, by modulating a few of the resonators, a screw dislocation along the
frequency axis can be created, which provides robust transport of photons along
the frequency axis. Demonstrating the physics of screw dislocation in a
topological system has been a significant challenge in solid state systems. Our
work indicates that the physics of three-dimensional topological insulator can
be explored in standard integrated photonics platforms, leading to
opportunities for novel devices that control the frequency of light.

  Construction","Accepted to AAAI 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driven by successes in deep learning, computer vision research has begun to
move beyond object detection and image classification to more sophisticated
tasks like image captioning or visual question answering. Motivating such
endeavors is the desire for models to capture not only objects present in an
image, but more fine-grained aspects of a scene such as relationships between
objects and their attributes. Scene graphs provide a formal construct for
capturing these aspects of an image. Despite this, there have been only a few
recent efforts to generate scene graphs from imagery. Previous works limit
themselves to settings where bounding box information is available at train
time and do not attempt to generate scene graphs with attributes. In this paper
we propose a method, based on recent advancements in Generative Adversarial
Networks, to overcome these deficiencies. We take the approach of first
generating small subgraphs, each describing a single statement about a scene
from a specific region of the input image chosen using an attention mechanism.
By doing so, our method is able to produce portions of the scene graphs with
attribute information without the need for bounding box labels. Then, the
complete scene graph is constructed from these subgraphs. We show that our
model improves upon prior work in scene graph generation on state-of-the-art
data sets and accepted metrics. Further, we demonstrate that our model is
capable of handling a larger vocabulary size than prior work has attempted.

have the option of specifying which, if any, of the query terms are heavily
dependent on each other and should be treated as a fixed phrase, for instance
by placing them between quotes. In addition to such cases where users specify
term dependence, automatic ways also exist for IR systems to detect dependent

is not however clear whether and to what extent user-defined term dependence

system to detect term dependence in queries? To answer this question, we
experiment with 101 crowdsourced search engine users and 334 queries (52 train

(i) user assessments of term dependence differ significantly from algorithmic
assessments of term dependence (their overlap is approximately 30%); (ii) there

disagreement increases as queries become longer; (iii) the potential retrieval

excite MHD waves, thus generating magnetic disturbances. We propose a generic
model of CR penetration into molecular clouds through their diffuse envelopes,
and identify the leading physical processes controlling their transport on the
way from a highly ionized interstellar medium to a dense interior of the cloud.
The model allows us to describe a transition between a free streaming of CRs
and their diffusive propagation, determined by the scattering on the
self-generated disturbances. A self consistent set of equations, governing the
diffusive transport regime in an envelope and the MHD turbulence generated by
the modulated CR flux, is essentially characterized by two dimensionless
numbers. We demonstrate a remarkable mutual complementarity of different
mechanisms leading to the onset of the diffusive regime, which results in a
universal energy spectrum of the modulated CRs. In conclusion, we briefly
discuss implications of our results for several fundamental astrophysical
problems, such as the spatial distribution of CRs in the Galaxy as well as the
ionization, heating, and chemistry in dense molecular clouds.

  Tensor Arithmetic","To appear in SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing",,,,"cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Researchers are increasingly incorporating numeric high-order data, i.e.,
numeric tensors, within their practice. Just like the matrix/vector (MV)
paradigm, the development of multi-purpose, but high-performance, sparse data
structures and algorithms for arithmetic calculations, e.g., those found in
Einstein-like notation, is crucial for the continued adoption of tensors. We
use the example of high-order differential operators to illustrate this need.
As sparse tensor arithmetic is an emerging research topic, with challenges
distinct from the MV paradigm, many aspects require further articulation. We
focus on three core facets. First, aligning with prominent voices in the field,
we emphasise the importance of data structures able to accommodate the
operational complexity of tensor arithmetic. However, we describe a linearised
coordinate (LCO) data structure that provides faster and more memory-efficient
sorting performance. Second, flexible data structures, like the LCO, rely
heavily on sorts and permutations. We introduce an innovative permutation
algorithm, based on radix sort, that is tailored to rearrange already-sorted
sparse data, producing significant performance gains. Third, we introduce a
novel poly-algorithm for sparse tensor products, where hyper-sparsity is a
possibility. Different manifestations of hyper-sparsity demand their own
approach, which our poly-algorithm is the first to provide. These developments
are incorporated within our LibNT and NTToolbox software libraries. Benchmarks,
frequently drawn from the high-order differential operators example,
demonstrate the practical impact of our routines, with speed-ups of 40% or
higher compared to alternative high-performance implementations. Comparisons
against the MATLAB Tensor Toolbox show over 10 times speed improvements. Thus,
these advancements produce significant practical improvements for sparse tensor
arithmetic.

densities by decreasing the beam aperture size for a given peak electric field
set by breakdown limitations. Using multiple parallel beams, each totaling to
an area A, can result in higher total beam current compared to a single

density. Here we demonstrate that Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE)

a far reaching generalization of conventional time and frequency modulations

conceptual link between Radar and communication. The OTFS waveforms couple with
the wireless channel in a way that directly captures the underlying physics,
yielding a high-resolution delay-Doppler Radar image of the constituent
reflectors. As a result, the time-frequency selective channel is converted into
an invariant, separable and orthogonal interaction, where all received QAM
symbols experience the same localized impairment and all the delay-Doppler
diversity branches are coherently combined. The high resolution delay-Doppler
separation of the reflectors enables OTFS to approach channel capacity with
optimal performance-complexity tradeoff through linear scaling of spectral
efficiency with the MIMO order and robustness to Doppler and multipath channel

almost all fields. Over the decades, multiple approaches have been proposed to
solve convex programs. The development of interior-point methods allowed
solving a more general set of convex programs known as semi-definite programs
and second-order cone programs. However, it has been established that these
methods are excessively slow for high dimensions, i.e., they suffer from the
curse of dimensionality. On the other hand, optimization algorithms on manifold
have shown great ability in finding solutions to nonconvex problems in
reasonable time. This paper is interested in solving a subset of convex
optimization using a different approach. The main idea behind Riemannian
optimization is to view the constrained optimization problem as an
unconstrained one over a restricted search space. The paper introduces three
manifolds to solve convex programs under particular box constraints. The
manifolds, called the doubly stochastic, symmetric and the definite multinomial
manifolds, generalize the simplex also known as the multinomial manifold. The
proposed manifolds and algorithms are well-adapted to solving convex programs
in which the variable of interest is a multidimensional probability
distribution function. Theoretical analysis and simulation results testify the
efficiency of the proposed method over state of the art methods. In particular,
they reveal that the proposed framework outperforms conventional generic and

collected, analyzed and contextualized to support disaster risk management.
However, disaster management agencies typically use such added-value
information to support only their own decisions. A feedback loop between
contextualized information and data suppliers would result in various
advantages. First, it could facilitate the near real-time communication of
early warnings derived from social media, linked to other sources of
information. Second, it could support the staff of aid organizations during
response operations. Based on the example of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma we show
how filtered, geolocated Tweets can be used for rapid damage assessment. We
claim that the next generation of big data analyses will have to generate
actionable information resulting from the application of advanced analytical
techniques. These applications could include the provision of social
media-based training data for algorithms designed to forecast actual cyclone
impacts or new socio-economic validation metrics for seasonal climate
forecasts.

data (e.g., personal, genomic or medical data) and wants to run intensive
computations on it, as part of a machine learning algorithm for example. The
Master wants to distribute these computations to untrusted workers who have
volunteered or are incentivized to help with this task. However, the data must
be kept private and not revealed to the individual workers. Some of the workers
may be stragglers, e.g., slow or busy, and will take a random time to finish
the task assigned to them. We are interested in reducing the delays experienced
by the Master. We focus on linear computations as an essential operation in
many iterative algorithms such as principal component analysis, support vector
machines and other gradient-descent based algorithms. A classical solution is
to use a linear secret sharing scheme, such as Shamir's scheme, to divide the
data into secret shares on which the workers can perform linear computations.
However, classical codes can provide straggler mitigation assuming a worst-case
scenario of a fixed number of stragglers. We propose a solution based on new
secure codes, called Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the
authors. Staircase codes allow flexibility in the number of stragglers up to a
given maximum, and universally achieve the information theoretic limit on the
download cost by the Master, leading to latency reduction. Under the shifted
exponential model, we find upper and lower bounds on the Master's mean waiting
time. We derive the distribution of the Master's waiting time, and its mean,
for systems with up to two stragglers. For systems with any number of
stragglers, we derive an expression that can give the exact distribution, and
the mean, of the waiting time of the Master. We show that Staircase codes

  Certifying multipartite entanglement is generally a fundamental task. Since
an $N$ qubit state is parameterized by $4^N-1$ real numbers, one is interested
to design a measurement setup that reveals multipartite entanglement with as
little effort as possible, at least without fully revealing the whole
information of the state, the so called ""tomography"", which requires
exponential energy.
  In this paper, we study this problem of certifying entanglement without
tomography in the constrain that only single copy measurements can be applied.
This task is formulate as a membership problem related to a dividing quantum
state space, therefore, related to the geometric structure of state space. We
show that universal entanglement detection among all states can never be
accomplished without full state tomography. Moreover, we show that almost all
multipartite correlation, include genuine entanglement detection, entanglement
depth verification, requires full state tomography. However, universal
entanglement detection among pure states can be much more efficient, even we
only allow local measurements. Almost optimal local measurement scheme for

the dust maximum activity in MY28 than in other Martian years. A possible
precursor signal to the global dust storm in MY 28 is observed at Ls = 200 -

different categories of patterns in instructional design. We then present the
notion of Pattern-Oriented Instructional Design (POID) as a way to model
instructional design as a connection of patterns (GoalPattern, ProcessPattern,

environments involving lower levels of SNR is presented in this paper, where
the total system of speech enhancement is divided into two separate steps. The
first step is based on noise compensation on short time magnitude and the
second step is based on phase compensation. The magnitude spectrum is
compensated based on a modified spectral subtraction method where the
cross-terms containing spectra of noise and clean speech are taken into
consideration, which are neglected in the traditional spectral subtraction
methods. By employing the modified magnitude and unchanged phase, a procedure
is formulated to compensate the overestimation or underestimation of noise by
phase compensation method based on the probability of speech presence. A
modified complex spectrum based on these two steps are obtained to synthesize a
musical noise free enhanced speech. Extensive simulations are carried out using
the speech files available in the NOIZEUS database in order to evaluate the
performance of the proposed method. It is shown in terms of the objective
measures, spectrogram analysis and formal subjective listening tests that the
proposed method consistently outperforms some of the state-of-the-art methods

scaling and quantizing at the relays combined with nontraining-based schemes.
We show the optimality of this scheme with respect to the outer bound in terms

revealed by Zheng and Tse, by demonstrating that not all the available antennas
might be used, as it is suboptimal to learn all their channel parameters. Our
results in this paper for the diamond network demonstrates that in certain
regimes the optimal scheme uses a subnetwork, demonstrating a tradeoff between
channel learning and communications. In some regimes, it is gDoF optimal to do
relay selection, i.e, use a part of the network. In the other regimes, even
when it is essential to use the entire network, it is suboptimal to learn the

recombination rate in monolayer TMDCs as a function of photon emission
direction and polarization, and obtain polar plots of the PL for different

excitons in a quantum superposition state of the K and K' inequivalent valleys
emit light anisotropically upon recombination. Our results can explain the PL
anisotropy and polarization dependence measured in recent experiments, and
predict new light emission regimes. When averaged over emission angle and

principle, this justifies asking how much one can learn about the BH horizon
itself from such a measurement. Since the shadow is determined by a set of
special photon orbits, rather than horizon properties, it is possible that
different horizon geometries yield similar shadows. One may then ask how
sensitive is the shadow to details of the horizon geometry? As a case study, we
consider the double Schwarzschild BH and analyse the impact on the lensing and
shadows of the conical singularity that holds the two BHs in equilibrium --
herein taken to be a strut along the symmetry axis in between the two BHs.
Whereas the conical singularity induces a discontinuity of the scattering angle
of photons, clearly visible in the lensing patterns along the direction of the
strut's location, it produces no observable effect on the shadows, whose edges
remain everywhere smooth. The latter feature is illustrated by examples
including both equal and unequal mass BHs. This smoothness contrasts with the
intrinsic geometry of the (spatial sections of the) horizon of these BHs, which
is not smooth, and provides a sharp example on how BH shadows are insensitive
to some horizon geometry details. This observation, moreover, suggests that for
the study of their shadows, this static double BH system may be an informative
proxy for a dynamical binary.

body (MB), and ancillary structures, is a relatively simple neural system
capable of learning. Its structural features, which are widespread in
biological neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade of
networks where large dimension shifts occur from stage to stage and where
sparsity and randomness play a critical role in coding. Learning is partly
enabled by a neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation of the
AL, whose increased activity induces rewiring of the MB through Hebbian
plasticity. Enforced sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that
are the most important for the representation of the learned odor. Based upon
current biophysical knowledge, we have constructed an end-to-end computational
model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which includes the interaction
of the AL and MB under octopamine stimulation. Our model is able to robustly
learn new odors, and our simulations of integrate-and-fire neurons match the
statistical features of in-vivo firing rate data. From a biological
perspective, the model provides a valuable tool for examining the role of
neuromodulators, like octopamine, in learning, and gives insight into critical
interactions between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during learning.
Our simulations also inform predictions about structural details of the
olfactory system that are not currently well-characterized. From a machine
learning perspective, the model yields bio-inspired mechanisms that are
potentially useful in constructing neural nets for rapid learning from very few
samples. These mechanisms include high-noise layers, sparse layers as noise
filters, and a biologically-plausible optimization method to train the network
based on octopamine stimulation, sparse layers, and Hebbian growth.

annotate an ImageNet-like dateset. On the contrary, it is fairly convenient,
fast, and cheap to collect training images from the Web along with their noisy
labels. This signifies the need of alternative approaches to training deep
neural networks using such noisy labels. Existing methods tackling this problem
either try to identify and correct the wrong labels or reweigh the data terms
in the loss function according to the inferred noisy rates. Both strategies
inevitably incur errors for some of the data points. In this paper, we contend
that it is actually better to ignore the labels of some of the data points than
to keep them if the labels are incorrect, especially when the noisy rate is
high. After all, the wrong labels could mislead a neural network to a bad local
optimum. We suggest a two-stage framework for the learning from noisy labels.
In the first stage, we identify a small portion of images from the noisy
training set of which the labels are correct with a high probability. The noisy
labels of the other images are ignored. In the second stage, we train a deep
neural network in a semi-supervised manner. This framework effectively takes
advantage of the whole training set and yet only a portion of its labels that
are most likely correct. Experiments on three datasets verify the effectiveness
of our approach especially when the noisy rate is high.

developed with the purpose of studying self-assembling systems by focusing on
their thermodynamically favorable final states, and ignoring the kinetic
pathways through which they evolve. The model was intentionally developed to
abstract away not only the notion of time, but also the constraints of
geometry. Collections of monomers with binding domains which allow them to form
polymers via complementary bonds are analyzed to determine their final, stable
configurations, which are those which maximize the number of bonds formed (i.e.
enthalpy) and the number of independent components (i.e. entropy). In this
paper, we first develop a definition of what it means for a TBN to perform a
computation, and then present a set of constructions which are capable of
performing computations by simulating the behaviors of space-bounded Turing
machines and boolean circuits. In contrast to previous TBN results, these
constructions are robust to great variability in the counts of monomers
existing in the systems and the numbers of polymers that form in parallel.
Although the Turing machine simulating TBNs are inefficient in terms of the
numbers of unique monomer types required, as compared to algorithmic
self-assembling systems in the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), we then
show that a general strategy of porting those aTAM system designs to TBNs
produces TBNs which incorrectly simulate computations. Finally, we present a
refinement of the TBN model which we call the Geometric Thermodynamic Binding

form rigid bonds. Utilizing the constraints imposed by geometry, we then

to poor tool support and a lack of knowledge on how to prioritize technical
debt repayment and prevention activities. Furthermore, when there is a large
backlog of debt, developers often lack the motivation to address it. Objective:
In this paper, we describe a design study to investigate how gamification can
support Technical Debt Management in a large legacy software system of an
industrial company. Our study leads to a novel tool (named Themis) that
combines technical debt support, version control, and gamification features. In
addition to gamification features, Themis provides suggestions for developers
on where to focus their effort, and visualizations for managers to track
technical debt activities. Method: We describe how Themis was refined and
validated in an iterative deployment with the company, finally conducting a
qualitative study to investigate how the features of Themis affect technical
debt management behavior. We consider the impact on both developers and
managers. Results: Our results show that it achieves increased developer
motivation, and supports managers in monitoring and influencing developer
behaviors. We show how our findings may be transferable to other contexts by
proposing guidelines on how to apply gamification. Conclusions: With this case,
gamification appears as a promising solution to help technical debt management,
although it needs to be carefully designed and implemented to avoid its
possible negative effects.

Combinator abstraction dramatically reduces the number and complexity of

still allowing the CNPI to represent and interpret arbitrary complex programs
by the collaboration of the core with the other components. We propose a small
set of four combinators to capture the most pervasive programming patterns. Due
to the finiteness and simplicity of this combinator set and the offloading of
some burden of interpretation from the core, we are able construct a CNPI that
is universal with respect to the set of all combinatorizable programs, which is
adequate for solving most algorithmic tasks. Moreover, besides supervised
training on execution traces, CNPI can be trained by policy gradient
reinforcement learning with appropriately designed curricula.

along a straight line triangulated trajectory. The assumption of a straight
line trajectory has been considered an acceptable simplification for fireballs,
but it has not been rigorously tested. The unique capability of the Desert
Fireball Network (DFN) to triangulate discrete observation times gives the
opportunity to investigate the deviation of a meteoroid's position to different
model fits.
  Here we assess the viability of a straight line assumption for fireball data
in two meteorite-dropping test cases observed by the Desert Fireball Network
(DFN) in Australia -- one over 21 seconds (\textit{DN151212\_03}), one under 5
seconds (\textit{DN160410\_03}). We show that a straight line is not valid for
these two meteorite dropping events and propose a three dimensional particle
filter to model meteoroid positions without any straight line constraints. The
single body equations in three dimensions, along with the luminosity equation,
are applied to the particle filter methodology described by \citet{Sansom2017}.
  Modelling fireball camera network data in three dimensions has not previously
been attempted.
  This allows the raw astrometric, line-of-sight observations to be
incorporated directly.
  In analysing these two DFN events, the triangulated positions based on a
straight line assumption result in the modelled meteoroid positions diverging
up to $3.09\, km$ from the calculated observed point (for
\textit{DN151212\_03}). Even for the more typical fireball event,
\textit{DN160410\_03}, we see a divergence of up to $360$\,m.
  As DFN observations are typically precise to $<100$\,m, it is apparent that
the assumption of a straight line is an oversimplification that will affect
orbit calculations and meteorite search regions for a significant fraction of
events.

computationally advantageous when available random-access memory is not enough

Poisson subsampling produces a more efficient estimator if the sampling rate,
the ratio of the subsample size to the full data sample size, does not converge
to zero. We also obtain the unconditional asymptotic distribution for the

because they store and process sensitive information. When highly sensitive
data is involved, an air-gapped computer might also be kept secluded in a
Faraday cage. The Faraday cage prevents the leakage of electromagnetic signals
emanating from various computer parts, which may be picked up by an
eavesdropping adversary remotely. The air-gap separation, coupled with the
Faraday shield, provides a high level of isolation, preventing the potential
leakage of sensitive data from the system. In this paper, we show how attackers
can bypass Faraday cages and air-gaps in order to leak data from highly secure
computers. Our method is based on an exploitation of the magnetic field
generated by the computer CPU. Unlike electromagnetic radiation (EMR), low
frequency magnetic radiation propagates though the air, penetrating metal
shielding such as Faraday cages (e.g., compass still works inside Faraday
cages). We introduce a malware code-named ODINI that can control the low
frequency magnetic fields emitted from the infected computer by regulating the
load of the CPU cores. Arbitrary data can be modulated and transmitted on top
of the magnetic emission and received by a magnetic receiver (bug) placed
nearby. We provide technical background and examine the characteristics of the
magnetic fields. We implement a malware prototype and discuss the design
considerations along with the implementation details. We also show that the
malicious code does not require special privileges (e.g., root) and can
successfully operate from within isolated virtual machines (VMs) as well.

identifying spatiotemporal EEG features as the quasi-stable topography states

reconstruct an infinity reference approximately, it is a question whether REST
or the other references will be more reliable than average reference (AR) for
the microstates analysis. In this study, we design the microstate-based EEG
forward model, and apply different references for microstates analysis. The
spatial similarity between the generated and assumed cluster maps is mainly
investigated. Furthermore, the real EEG data by the parametric bootstrap method
is used to validate the performance of the references. Finally, we find that
REST is robust to recover more similar cluster maps to the assumption than AR
in the simulation, and the cluster maps between REST and AR on the real EEG
data are quite different. This study may indicate that REST contributes to
identifying more objective microstates features than AR.

quality levels with efficient usage of storage and networking resources. The
approach to store and transmit independent copies for every required quality
level is highly wasteful in resources. Alternatively, conventional scalable
coding has inherent loss due to its structure. This paper studies a layered
coding framework with a relaxed hierarchical structure to transmit information
common to different quality levels along with individual bit streams for each
quality level. The flexibility of sharing only a properly selected subset of
information from a lower quality level with the higher quality level, enables
achieving operating points between conventional scalable coding and independent
coding, to control the layered coding penalty. Jointly designing common and
individual layers' coders overcomes the limitations of conventional scalable
coding and non-scalable coding, by providing the flexibility of transmitting
common and individual bit-streams for different quality levels. It extracts the
common information between different quality levels with negligible performance
penalty. Simulation results for practically important sources, confirm the
superiority of the work.

frequency multiplication is a non-linear transmission-line (NLTL) used as a
frequency comb generator. The phase noise of the synthesizer is improved by
carefully optimizing the input power, the input and output impedances of the
NLTL. The absolute phase noises of the 9.1926 GHz output signal are measured to
be -64 dBc/Hz, -83 dBc/Hz, -92 dBc/Hz, -117 dBc/Hz and -119 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz,
10Hz, 100Hz, 1 kHz and 10 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. The residual
phase noise of the synthesizer is measured to be -82 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset
frequency. The measurement result shows that the absolute phase noise at the
frequency range of 1 - 100 Hz is mainly limited by the phase noise of the OCXO.
The contribution of the absolute phase noise to the fountain clock short-term
frequency stability is calculated to be 7.0x10^(-14). The residual frequency
stability of the synthesizer is measured to be1.5x10^(-14), which is consistent
with the calculated frequency stability due to the residual phase noise of the
synthesizer. Meanwhile we designed and realized an interferometric microwave
switch in the synthesizer to eliminate the frequency shifts induced by the
microwave leakage. The extinction ratio of the switch is measured to be more
than 50 dB. In the scheme, we use only commercially available components to
build the microwave frequency synthesizer with excellent phase noise

of line defects relative to the d-wave order parameter determines whether
in-gap states form due to scattering. Spectroscopic imaging of the anisotropic
magnetic vortex cores directly characterizes the short interlayer
superconducting coherence length and shows an electronic phase separation near
the upper critical in-plane magnetic field, consistent with a Pauli-limited
first-order phase transition into a pseudogap phase.

bears) are microscopic invertebrates that inhabit almost all terrestrial,
freshwater and marine habitats, from the highest mountains to the deepest
oceans. Thanks to their ability to live in a state of cryptobiosis, which is
known to be an adaptation to unpredictably fluctuating environmental
conditions, these organisms are able to survive when conditions are not
suitable for active life; consequently, tardigrades are known as the toughest
animals on Earth. In their cryptobiotic state, they can survive extreme
conditions, such as temperatures below -250{\deg}C and up to 150{\deg}C, high
doses of ultraviolet and ionising radiation, up to 30 years without liquid
water, low and high atmospheric pressure, and exposure to many toxic chemicals.
Active tardigrades are also resistant to a wide range of unfavourable
environmental conditions, which makes them an excellent model organism for
astrobiological studies. In our study, we have established a metric tool for
distinguishing the potential survivability of active and cryptobiotic
tardigrades on rocky-water and water-gas planets in our solar system and
exoplanets, taking into consideration the geometrical means of surface
temperature and surface pressure of the considered planets. The Active
Tardigrade Index (ATI) and Cryobiotic Tardigrade Index (CTI) are two metric
indices with minimum value 0 (= tardigrades cannot survive) and maximum 1 (=
tardigrades will survive in their respective state). Values between 0 and 1
indicate a percentage chance of the active or cryptobiotic tardigrades
surviving on a given exoplanet.

to efficiently achieve Shannon capacity. Given a (constant-sized) invertible
matrix $M$, a family of polar codes can be associated with this matrix and its
ability to approach capacity follows from the {\em polarization} of an
associated $[0,1]$-bounded martingale, namely its convergence in the limit to
either $0$ or $1$. Arikan showed polarization of the martingale associated with
the matrix $G_2 = \left(\begin{matrix} 1& 0 1& 1\end{matrix}\right)$ to get
capacity achieving codes. His analysis was later extended to all matrices $M$
that satisfy an obvious necessary condition for polarization.
  While Arikan's theorem does not guarantee that the codes achieve capacity at
small blocklengths, it turns out that a ""strong"" analysis of the polarization
of the underlying martingale would lead to such constructions. Indeed for the
martingale associated with $G_2$ such a strong polarization was shown in two
independent works ([Guruswami and Xia, IEEE IT '15] and [Hassani et al., IEEE
IT '14]), resolving a major theoretical challenge of the efficient attainment
of Shannon capacity.
  In this work we extend the result above to cover martingales associated with
all matrices that satisfy the necessary condition for (weak) polarization. In
addition to being vastly more general, our proofs of strong polarization are
also simpler and modular. Specifically, our result shows strong polarization
over all prime fields and leads to efficient capacity-achieving codes for
arbitrary symmetric memoryless channels. We show how to use our analyses to
achieve exponentially small error probabilities at lengths inverse polynomial
in the gap to capacity. Indeed we show that we can essentially match any error
probability with lengths that are only inverse polynomial in the gap to
capacity.

methods in LES including the discontinuous Galerkin (DG), finite difference
(FD), and compact difference (CD) methods. We begin by reviewing the
semi-discrete versions of all methods under-consideration, followed by a
fully-discrete analysis with explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration
schemes. In this regard, we are able to unravel the true dispersion/dissipation
behavior of DG and Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) schemes for the entire wavenumber
range. The physical-mode is verified to be a good approximation for the
asymptotic behavior of these DG schemes in the low wavenumber range. After
that, we proceed to compare the DG, FD, and CD methods in dispersion and
dissipation properties. Numerical tests are conducted using the linear
advection equation to verify the analysis. In comparing different methods, it
is found that the overall numerical dissipation strongly depends on the time
step. Compact difference (CD) and central finite difference (FD) schemes, in
some particular settings, can have more numerical dissipation than the DG
scheme with an upwind flux. This claim is then verified through a numerical
test using the Burgers' equation.

unconstrained or has an easy-to-project constraint set. In this paper, we
consider problems that have a stochastic objective and also many functional
constraints. For such problems, it could be extremely expensive to project a
point to the feasible set, or even compute subgradient and/or function value of
all constraint functions. To find solutions of these problems, we propose a
novel (adaptive) SGM based on the classical augmented Lagrangian function.
Within every iteration, it inquires a stochastic subgradient of the objective,
and a subgradient and the function value of one randomly sampled constraint
function. Hence, the per-iteration complexity is low. We establish its
convergence rate for convex problems and also problems with strongly convex
objective. It can achieve the optimal $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ convergence rate for
convex case and nearly optimal $O\big((\log k)/k\big)$ rate for strongly convex
case. Numerical experiments on a sample approximation problem of the robust

from one sender to a set of receivers via lossy wireless channels, assuming
each receiver already possesses a subset of these packets and wants the rest.
We aim to characterize the average packet decoding delay (APDD), which reflects
how soon each individual data packet can be decoded by each receiver on
average, and to minimize it while achieving optimal throughput. To this end, we
first derive closed-form lower bounds on the expected APDD of all LNC
techniques under random packet erasures. We then prove that these bounds are
NP-hard to achieve and, thus, that APDD minimization is an NP-hard problem. We
then study the performance of some existing LNC techniques, including random
linear network coding (RLNC) and instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). We
proved that all throughput-optimal LNC techniques can approximate the minimum
expected APDD with a ratio between 4/3 and 2. In particular, the ratio of RLNC
is exactly 2. We then prove that all IDNC techniques are only heuristics in
terms of throughput optimization and {cannot guarantee an APDD approximation
ratio for at least a subset of the receivers}. Finally, we propose
hyper-graphic linear network coding (HLNC), a novel throughput-optimal and
APDD-approximating LNC technique based on a hypergraph model of receivers'
packet reception state. We implement it under different availability of
receiver feedback, and numerically compare its performance with RLNC and a
heuristic general IDNC technique. The results show that the APDD performance of
HLNC is better under all tested system settings, even if receiver feedback is

and Laplacian instabilities. The approach to the tracker equation of state
$w_{\rm DE}=-2$ during the matter era, which is disfavored by observational
data, can be avoided by the existence of a quadratic k-essence Lagrangian

related to the Newtonian and weak lensing gravitational potentials

significant at a later cosmological epoch, the values of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$

The general results are adapted to the more specific case where the base
manifold is the Lie group of rotation matrices. The notion of the shape of a
curve can be formalized as the set of equivalence classes of curves given by
the quotient space of the space of curves and the increasing diffeomorphisms.
The metric in the space of curve naturally extent to the space of shapes and
enable comparison between shapes.

defined on 2D or 3D regular grids, with topological control. Certain techniques
allow users to control the pointwise error induced by the compression. However,
in many scenarios it is desirable to control in a similar way the preservation
of higher-level notions, such as topological features , in order to provide
guarantees on the outcome of post-hoc data analyses. This paper presents the
first compression technique for scalar data which supports a strictly
controlled loss of topological features. It provides users with specific
guarantees both on the preservation of the important features and on the size
of the smaller features destroyed during compression. In particular, we present
a simple compression strategy based on a topologically adaptive quantization of
the range. Our algorithm provides strong guarantees on the bottleneck distance
between persistence diagrams of the input and decompressed data, specifically
those associated with extrema. A simple extension of our strategy additionally
enables a control on the pointwise error. We also show how to combine our
approach with state-of-the-art compressors, to further improve the geometrical
reconstruction. Extensive experiments, for comparable compression rates,
demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in terms of the preservation of
topological features. We show the utility of our approach by illustrating the
compatibility between the output of post-hoc topological data analysis
pipelines, executed on the input and decompressed data, for simulated or
acquired data sets. We also provide a lightweight VTK-based C++ implementation
of our approach for reproduction purposes.

various computer vision tasks in recent years. This motivates people to deploy
CNNs to realworld applications. However, most of state-of-art CNNs require
large memory and computational resources, which hinders the deployment on
mobile devices. Recent studies show that low-bit weight representation can
reduce much storage and memory demand, and also can achieve efficient network
inference. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach named BWNH to
train Binary Weight Networks via Hashing. In this paper, we first reveal the
strong connection between inner-product preserving hashing and binary weight
networks, and show that training binary weight networks can be intrinsically
regarded as a hashing problem. Based on this perspective, we propose an
alternating optimization method to learn the hash codes instead of directly
learning binary weights. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and
ImageNet demonstrate that our proposed BWNH outperforms current state-of-art by
a large margin.

the trajectory of the particle is the spiral shape, but also the relationship

equation with parameters that change in time and/or space. We formally show
that the full PDE dynamics of a $N$-pulse configuration can be reduced to a
$N$-dimensional dynamical system describing the dynamics on a $N$-dimensional
manifold $\mathcal{M}_N$. Next, we determine the local stability of
$\mathcal{M}_N$ via the quasi-steady spectrum associated to evolving $N$-pulse
patterns, which provides provides explicit information on the boundary
$\partial\mathcal{M}_N$. Following the dynamics on $\mathcal{M}_N$, a $N$-pulse
pattern may move through $\partial\mathcal{M}_N$ and `fall off'
$\mathcal{M}_N$. A direct nonlinear extrapolation of our linear analysis
predicts the subsequent fast PDE dynamics as the pattern `jumps' to another
invariant manifold $\mathcal{M}_M$, and specifically predicts the number $N-M$
of pulses that disappear. Combining the asymptotic analysis with numerical
simulations of the dynamics on the various invariant manifolds yields a hybrid
asymptotic-numerical method describing the full process that starts with a
$N$-pulse pattern and typically ends in the trivial homogeneous state without
pulses. We extensively test this method against PDE simulations and deduce
general conjectures on the nature of pulse interactions with disappearing
pulses. We especially consider the differences between the evolution of
irregular and regular patterns. In the former case, the disappearing process is
gradual: irregular patterns loose their pulses one by one. In contrast,
regular, spatially periodic, patterns undergo catastrophic transitions in which
either half or all pulses disappear. However, making a precise distinction
between these two drastically different processes is quite subtle, since
irregular $N$-pulse patterns that do not cross $\partial\mathcal{M}_N$
typically evolve towards regularity.

central question in oceanography, for problems ranging from nutrient delivery
to phytoplankton, to the early detection of contaminants. Most analyses have
been based on Lagrangian concepts of transport, focusing on the identification
of features minimizing fluid exchange among regions, or more recently on
network tools which focus on connectivity and transport pathways. Neither of
these approaches allows ranking the geographical sites of major water passage
and selecting them so that they monitor waters coming from separate parts of
the ocean. These are instead key criteria when deploying an observing network.
Here we address this issue by estimating at any point the extent of the ocean
surface which transits through it in a given time window. With such information
we are able to rank the sites with major fluxes that intercept waters
originating from different regions. We show that this allows us to optimize an
observing network, where a set of sampling sites can be chosen for monitoring
the largest flux of water dispersing out of a given region. When the analysis
is performed backward in time, this method allows us to identify the major
sources which feed a target region. The method is first applied to a
minimalistic model of a mesoscale eddy field, and then to realistic
satellite-derived ocean currents in the Kerguelen area. In this region we
identify the optimal location of fixed stations capable of intercepting the
trajectories of 43 surface drifters, along with statistics on the temporal
persistence of the stations determined in this way. We then identify possible
hotspots of micro-nutrient enrichment for the recurrent spring phytoplanktonic
bloom occuring here. Promising applications to other fields, such as larval
connectivity, marine spatial planning or contaminant detection, are then
discussed.

space of internal models considered by a learner, and they help the learner
make inferences that go beyond the observed data. A recent study found that
deep neural networks optimized for object recognition develop the shape bias
(Ritter et al., 2017), an inductive bias possessed by children that plays an
important role in early word learning. However, these networks use
unrealistically large quantities of training data, and the conditions required
for these biases to develop are not well understood. Moreover, it is unclear
how the learning dynamics of these networks relate to developmental processes
in childhood. We investigate the development and influence of the shape bias in
neural networks using controlled datasets of abstract patterns and synthetic
images, allowing us to systematically vary the quantity and form of the
experience provided to the learning algorithms. We find that simple neural
networks develop a shape bias after seeing as few as 3 examples of 4 object
categories. The development of these biases predicts the onset of vocabulary

time that queues begin to build starting from an empty system, one of them

growth in the beams being focused. One cause of such aberrations is beam-driven
plasma wakefields, present if the beam density is sufficiently high. We develop
simple, but powerful analytic formulas for the effective focusing gradient from
these wakefields, and use this to set limits on which parts of the beam and

is concluded that the application of active plasma lenses to conventional and

increased, and that in general these lenses are better suited for accelerator
applications with lower beam intensities.

maximize the overlap between hostdevice communication and accelerator

partition. However, determining the right resource partition and task
parallelism on a per program, per dataset basis is challenging. This is because
the number of possible solutions is huge, and the benefit of choosing the right

paper, we present an automatic approach to determine the hardware resource

learning techniques to automatically learn it. We achieve this by first
learning a predictive model offline using training programs; we then use the
learned model to predict the resource partition and task granularity for any
unseen programs at runtime. We apply our approach to 23 representative parallel
applications and evaluate it on a CPU-XeonPhi mixed heterogenous many-core

from a moving feature located to the south known as C3. Other facilities have
also detected these short-term variations above a slowly rising trend at

instruments. Due to the relative proximity of the source (z=0.018), it provides
a unique opportunity to pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emission by
combining the Gamma ray data with very long baseline inteferometry (VLBI) data.
A study using the Korean VLBI network (KVN) showed that the Gamma rays occur in
both downstream jet emission and the region near where the jet is launched.
Further analysis of the kinematics using Wavelet Image Segmentation and
Evaluation (WISE) algorithm, which uses 2-dimensional cross-correlations to
statistically derive the kinematics of high-resolution 7 mm VLBA data show that
the Gamma ray emission is caused by a fast-travelling shock catching a slower
moving shock and then interacting with the external medium, in behaviour
reminiscent of a long duration gamma-ray burst (GRB). This could explain why
such high energy flaring is seen in such low Doppler boosted sources. Finally,
we show some early results from a study of the jet launching region using the
Global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA). The nucleus appears to have a consistent double
nuclear structure that is likely too broad to be the true jet base.

brings a drastic improvement to the band structure. Important side-effects
include improvements in the description of dielectric and optical properties,
not only involving conduction band (excited) states, but also the valence. We
find that the highly dispersive conduction band bottom of HAp originates from
anti-bonding $\sigma^{*}$ states along the $\cdots\textrm{OH-OH-}\cdots$
infinite chain, suggesting the formation of a conductive 1D-ice phase. The
choice of the exchange-correlation treatment to the calculation of defect

integrate DD with quantum gates using optimal control techniques to realize
robust quantum gates which offer protection against decoherence. To investigate
the protection of non-classical correlation, we study the evolution of quantum

significant protection against decoherence and incoherence. We find better
performances by phase alternating DD sequences with suitable spacings between

protecting the non-classical correlation. We also support the experimental
results by analyzing the robustness of various DD schemes.

networks, i.e. nodes without prior position knowledge (agents) wish to
determine their own positions. In non-cooperative approaches, positioning is
only based on information from reference nodes with known positions (anchors).
However, in cooperative positioning, information from other agents is
considered as well. Cooperative positioning requires encoding of the
uncertainty of agents' positions. To cope with that demand, we employ
stochastic inference for localization which inherently considers the position
uncertainty of agents. However, stochastic inference comes at the expense of
high costs in terms of computation and information exchange. To relax the
requirements of inference algorithms, we propose the framework of
position-constrained stochastic inference, in which we first confine the
positions of nodes to feasible sets. We use convex polygons to impose
constraints on the possible positions of agents. By doing so, we enable
inference algorithms to concentrate on important regions of the sample space
rather than the entire sample space. We show through simulations that increased
localization accuracy, reduced computational complexity, and quicker
convergence can be achieved when compared to a state-of-the-art non-constrained
inference algorithm.

learning framework that is designed for learning a conditional probability
distribution on unlabelled input data in a target domain, while also only
having access to: (1) easily obtained labelled data from a related source
domain, which may have a different conditional probability distribution than
the target domain, and (2) a marginalised prior distribution on the labels for
the target domain. TAN leverages a fully adversarial training procedure and a
unique generator/encoder architecture which approximates the transductive
combination of the available source- and target-domain data. A benefit of TAN
is that it allows the distance between the source- and target-domain
label-vector marginal probability distributions to be greater than 0 (i.e.
different tasks across the source and target domains) whereas other
domain-adaptation algorithms require this distance to equal 0 (i.e. a single
task across the source and target domains). TAN can, however, still handle the
latter case and is a more generalised approach to this case. Another benefit of
TAN is that due to being a fully adversarial algorithm, it has the potential to
accurately approximate highly complex distributions. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates the viability of the TAN framework.

observed geo-effective partial-/full-halo CMEs and using algorithms of the
Support Vector Machine (SVM). We demonstrate that CAT-PUMA is accurate and
fast. In particular, predictions after applying CAT-PUMA to a test set, that is
unknown to the engine, show a mean absolute prediction error $\sim$5.9 hours of
the CME arrival time, with 54% of the predictions having absolute errors less
than 5.9 hours. Comparison with other models reveals that CAT-PUMA has a more
accurate prediction for 77% of the events investigated; and can be carried out
very fast, i.e. within minutes after providing the necessary input parameters

perform their own applications for prediction using CAT-PUMA.

constrained parameterization framework for mesoscale eddies --- termed
GEOMETRIC --- is proposed and implemented in three-dimensional primitive
equation channel and sector models. The GEOMETRIC framework closes mesoscale
eddy fluxes according to the standard Gent--McWilliams scheme, but with the
eddy transfer coefficient constrained by the depth-integrated eddy energy
field, provided through a prognostic eddy energy budget evolving with the mean

broadly reproduce model sensitivities of the eddy permitting reference
calculations in the emergent circumpolar transport, meridional overturning
circulation profile and the depth-integrated eddy energy signature; in
particular, eddy saturation emerges in the sector configuration. Some
differences arise, attributed here to the simple prognostic eddy energy budget
employed, to be improved upon in future investigations. The GEOMETRIC framework
thus proposes a shift in paradigm, from a focus on how to close for eddy
fluxes, to focusing on the representation of eddy energetics.

nuisance models, and (2) using data-adaptive nuisance fits, obtained from the
Super Learner, an ensemble machine learning method.

parametric model for the treatment effect curve is correctly specified, the
g-estimator outperforms all others, but when this model is misspecified, TMLE
performs best, while TSLS can result in large biases and zero coverage.

phenomenology in successively greater detail. Experiments have demonstrated
that V-groove quantum wires and pyramidal quantum dots result from
self-limiting concentration profiles that develop at the bottom of V-grooves
and inverted pyramids, respectively. In the 1950s, long before the practical
importance of patterned substrates became evident, the mechanisms of
capillarity during the equilibration of non-planar surfaces were identified and
characterized. This was followed, from the late 1980s by the identification of
growth rate anisotropies (i.e. differential growth rates of crystallographic
facets) and precursor decomposition anisotropies, with parallel developments in
the fabrication of V-groove quantum wires and pyramidal quantum dots. The
modelling of these growth processes began at the scale of facets and culminated
in systems of coupled reaction-diffusion equations, one for each
crystallographic facet that defines the pattern, which takes account of the
decomposition and surface diffusion kinetics of the group-III precursors and
the subsequent surface diffusion and incorporation of the group-III atoms
released by these precursors. Solutions of the equations with optimized
parameters produced concentration profiles that provided a quantitative
interpretation of the time-, temperature-, and alloy-concentration dependence
of the self-ordering process seen in experiments.

evolution model, metallicity dependent isotopic yields from low and
intermediate mass stars and yields from massive stars which include, for the
first time, the combined effect of metallicity, mass loss and rotation for a
large grid of stellar masses and for all stages of stellar evolution. The
yields of massive stars are weighted by a metallicity dependent function of the
rotational velocities, constrained by observations as to obtain a primary-like
$^{14}$N behavior at low metallicity and to avoid overproduction of s-elements
at intermediate metallicities. We show that the solar system isotopic
composition can be reproduced to better than a factor of two for isotopes up to
the Fe-peak, and at the 10\% level for most pure s-isotopes, both light ones
(resulting from the weak s-process in rotating massive stars) and the heavy
ones (resulting from the main s-process in low and intermediate mass stars). We
conclude that the light element primary process (LEPP), invoked to explain the
apparent abundance deficiency of the s-elements with A< 100, is not necessary.
We also reproduce the evolution of the heavy to light s-elements abundance
ratio ([hs/ls]) - recently observed in unevolved thin disk stars - as a result
of the contribution of rotating massive stars at sub-solar metallicities. We
find that those stars produce primary F and dominate its solar abundance and we
confirm their role in the observed primary behavior of N. In contrast, we show

users. To this end, the user controls the traffic on all transmission paths as
an entirety, which leads to a noticeable problem of low bandwidth utilization.
In particular, the congestion of a certain path will trigger the traffic
reduction on the other transmission paths that are underutilized. Some
solutions have been proposed by letting routers balance the loads of different
paths to avoid congesting a certain path prematurely. However, the complexity
of obtaining an optimal load balancing solution (of solving a Multi-Commodity
Flow problem) becomes higher with the increasing network size, which limits the
universal NDN deployments. This paper introduces a compromising solution -
Path-specified Transport Protocol (PTP). PTP supports both the label switching
and the addressless routing schemes. Specifically, the label switching scheme
facilitates users to precisely control the traffic on each transmission path,
and the addressless routing scheme maintains the valuable feature of retrieving
content from any provider to guarantee robustness. As the traffic on a
transmission path can be explicitly controlled by consumers, load balancing is
no longer needed in routers, which reduce the computational burden of routers
and consequently increase the system scalability. The experimental results show
that PTP significantly increases the users' downloading rates and improved the
network throughput.

blind narrow-band Halpha+[NII] imaging survey carried out with MegaCam at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The survey covers the whole Virgo cluster
region from its core to one virial radius (104 deg^2). The sensitivity of the
survey is of f(Halpha) ~ 4 x 10^-17 erg sec-1 cm^-2 (5 sigma detection limit)
for point sources and Sigma (Halpha) ~ 2 x 10^-18 erg sec^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 (1
sigma detection limit at 3 arcsec resolution) for extended sources, making
VESTIGE the deepest and largest blind narrow-band survey of a nearby cluster.
This paper presents the survey in all its technical aspects, including the
survey design, the observing strategy, the achieved sensitivity in both the
narrow-band Halpha+[NII] and in the broad-band r filter used for the stellar
continuum subtraction, the data reduction, calibration, and products, as well
as its status after the first observing semester. We briefly describe the
Halpha properties of galaxies located in a 4x1 deg^2 strip in the core of the
cluster north of M87, where several extended tails of ionised gas are detected.
This paper also lists the main scientific motivations of VESTIGE, which include
the study of the effects of the environment on galaxy evolution, the fate of
the stripped gas in cluster objects, the star formation process in nearby
galaxies of different type and stellar mass, the determination of the Halpha
luminosity function and of the Halpha scaling relations down to ~ 10^6 Mo
stellar mass objects, and the reconstruction of the dynamical structure of the
Virgo cluster. This unique set of data will also be used to study the HII
luminosity function in hundreds of galaxies, the diffuse Halpha+[NII] emission
of the Milky Way at high Galactic latitude, and the properties of emission line
galaxies at high redshift.

abundance ratios both inside and outside the solar system. The elemental ratio
in the solar neighborhood is 440. Recent ALMA observations showed HCN/HC15N
ratios from 83 to 156 in six T Tauri and Herbig disks and a CN/C15 N ratio of
323 +/- 30 in one T Tauri star. We aim to determine the dominant mechanism
responsible for these enhancements of 15N: low-temperature exchange reactions
or isotope-selective photodissociation of N2.
  Methods: Using the thermochemical code DALI, we model the nitrogen isotope
chemistry in circumstellar disks with a 2D axisymmetric geometry. Our chemical
network is the first to include both fractionation mechanisms for nitrogen. The
model produces abundance profiles and isotope ratios for several key N-bearing
species. We study how these isotope ratios depend on various disk parameters.
  Results: The formation of CN and HCN is closely coupled to the vibrational
excitation of H2 in the UV-irradiated surface layers of the disk. Isotope
fractionation is completely dominated by isotope-selective photodissociation of
N2. The column density ratio of HCN over HC15N in the disk's inner 100 au does
not depend strongly on the disk mass, the flaring angle or the stellar
spectrum, but it is sensitive to the grain size distribution. For larger
grains, self-shielding of N2 becomes more important relative to dust
extinction, leading to stronger isotope fractionation. Between disk radii of
~50 and 200 au, the models predict HCN/HC15N and CN/C15N abundance ratios
consistent with observations of disks and comets. The HCN/HC15N and CN/C15N
column density ratios in the models are a factor of 2-3 higher than those
inferred from the ALMA observations.

(Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$)(Zn$_{1-y}$Mn$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ offers a unique and
versatile control of the Curie temperature, $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, by decoupling the
spin (Mn$^{2+}$, $S=5/2$) and charge (K$^{+}$) doping in different
crystallographic layers. In an attempt to describe from first-principles
calculations the role of hole doping in stabilizing ferromagnetic order, it was
recently suggested that the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling $J$ between the
nearest-neighbor Mn ions would experience a nearly twofold suppression upon
doping 20\% of holes by potassium substitution. At the same time,
further-neighbor interactions become increasingly ferromagnetic upon doping,
leading to a rapid increase of $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. Using inelastic neutron
scattering, we have observed a localized magnetic excitation at about 13 meV,
associated with the destruction of the nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn singlet ground
state. Hole doping results in a notable broadening of this peak, evidencing
significant particle-hole damping, but with only a minor change in the peak
position. We argue that this unexpected result can be explained by a combined
effect of superexchange and double-exchange interactions.

considers an attacker who is active under both hypotheses, namely, a fully

one hypothesis only. In the fully active setup, the attacker distorts sequences
drawn both from $P_0$ and from an alternative memoryless source $P_1$, up to a
certain distortion level, which is possibly different under the two hypotheses,
in order to maximize the confusion in distinguishing between the two sources,

quantum phase transitions from the quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase to
magnetically ordered phases when the finite Heisenberg exchange coupling is
introduced. We examine temperature dependence of dynamical spin structure

from a spin-excitation continuum, which is a characteristic of the QSL, to a
damped high-energy magnon mode occurs at temperatures higher than the energy
scale of the Heisenberg couplings or the spin gap that is a signature of the
QSL at zero temperature. The crossover and the closeness to the Kitaev's QSL

Courant-Friedricks-Lewy condition in DUGKS is ajustable which can increase
numerical stability. Furthermore, with the finite-volume formulation the model
can be easily implemented on non-uniform meshes which can improve numerical

layered Poiseuille flow, rising bubble and Rayleigh-Taylor instability and

algorithms, in which a learner attempts to resolve an online prediction (or any
type of decision-making) task by learning a model/hypothesis from a sequence of
data instances one at a time. The goal of online learning is to ensure that the
online learner would make a sequence of accurate predictions (or correct
decisions) given the knowledge of correct answers to previous prediction or
learning tasks and possibly additional information. This is in contrast to many
traditional batch learning or offline machine learning algorithms that are
often designed to train a model in batch from a given collection of training
data instances. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the
online machine learning literatures through a systematic review of basic ideas
and key principles and a proper categorization of different algorithms and
techniques. Generally speaking, according to the learning type and the forms of
feedback information, the existing online learning works can be classified into
three major categories: (i) supervised online learning where full feedback
information is always available, (ii) online learning with limited feedback,
and (iii) unsupervised online learning where there is no feedback available.
Due to space limitation, the survey will be mainly focused on the first
category, but also briefly cover some basics of the other two categories.
Finally, we also discuss some open issues and attempt to shed light on
potential future research directions in this field.

remain mandatory in most of cases for accessing data. On the one hand, SQL is
easy-to-use by non specialists and allows to identify pertinent initial data at
the very beginning of the data exploration process. On the other hand, it is
not always so easy to formulate SQL queries: nowadays, it is more and more
frequent to have several databases available for one application domain, some
of them with hundreds of tables and/or attributes. Identifying the pertinent
conditions to select the desired data, or even identifying relevant attributes
is far from trivial. To make it easier to write SQL queries, we propose the
notion of SQL query completion: given a query, it suggests additional
conditions to be added to its WHERE clause. This completion is semantic, as it
relies on the data from the database, unlike current completion tools that are
mostly syntactic. Since the process can be repeated over and over again --
until the data analyst reaches her data of interest --, SQL query completion
facilitates the exploration of databases. SQL query completion has been
implemented in a SQL editor on top of a database management system. For the
evaluation, two questions need to be studied: first, does the completion speed
up the writing of SQL queries? Second , is the completion easily adopted by
users? A thorough experiment has been conducted on a group of 70 computer
science students divided in two groups (one with the completion and the other
one without) to answer those questions. The results are positive and very
promising.

Roughness, which is given by the $\mathcal{L}^2 (\R^2)$ distance between Wigner
and Husimi functions. We show that the Roughness is bounded and therefore it is
a useful tool for comparison between different quantum states for single
bosonic systems. The state classification via the Roughness is not binary, but
rather it is continuous in the interval [0,1], being the state more classic as
the Roughness approaches to zero, and more quantum when it is closer to the
unity. The Roughness is maximum for Fock states when its number of photons is
arbitrarily large, and also for squeezed states at the maximum compression
limit. On the other hand, the Roughness reaches its minimum value for thermal
states at infinite temperature and, more generally, for infinite entropy
states. The Roughness of a coherent state is slightly below one half, so we may
say that it is more a classical state than a quantum one. Another important
result is that the Roughness performs well for discriminating both pure and
mixed states. Since the Roughness measures the inherent quantumness of a state,
we propose another function, the Dynamic Distance Measure (DDM), which is
suitable for measure how much quantum is a dynamics. Using DDM, we studied the
quartic oscillator, and we observed that there is a certain complementarity
between dynamics and state, i.e. when dynamics becomes more quantum, the
Roughness of the state decreases, while the Roughness grows as the dynamics
becomes less quantum.

neutron sources.
  This paper describes the construction of the prototype detector with a high

of several months after deployment at the BR2 reactor site. All detector cells
provide sufficient light yields to achieve a target energy resolution of better
than 20%/$\sqrt{E(MeV)}$. The capability of the detector to track muons is
exploited to equalize the light response of a large number of channels to a
precision of 3% and to demonstrate the stability of the energy scale over time.
Particle identification based on pulse-shape discrimination is demonstrated
with calibration sources. Despite a lower neutron detection efficiency due to
triggering constraints, the main backgrounds at the reactor site were
determined and taken into account in the shielding strategy for the main
experiment. The results obtained with this prototype proved essential in the
design optimization of the final detector.

spectroscopic identification criteria are based. These bands may contain
simultaneously states of even and odd spins, of both parities and parity
doublets at well defined spins. In the exact-symmetry limit those bands involve
no E2-transitions. We show that coexistence of tetrahedral and octahedral

defines a Riemannian metric on the space coordinatized by their interpoint

representations of $F_4$, $E_6$ and $G_2$ exceptional groups are calculated by
means of the unit center element. Due to the absence of the non-trivial center
elements, the potential of every representation is screened at far distances.
However, the linear part is observed at intermediate quark separations which is
investigated by the decomposition of the exceptional group to its maximal
subgroups. Comparing the group factor of the super-group with the corresponding
one obtained from the non-trivial center elements of $SU(3)$ subgroup, shows
that $SU(3)$ is not the direct cause of temporary confinement in any of the
exceptional groups. However, the trivial potential obtained from the group
decomposition to the $SU(3)$ subgroup is the same as the potential of the
super-group itself. In addition, any regular or singular decomposition to the
$SU(2)$ subgroup which produces the Cartan generator with the same elements as
$h_1$, in any exceptional group, leads to the linear intermediate potential of
the exceptional gauge groups. The other $SU(2)$ decompositions with the Cartan
generator different from $h_1$, are still able to describe the linear potential
if the number of $SU(2)$ non-trivial center element which emerge in the
decompositions is the same. As a result, it is the center vortices quantized in
terms of non-trivial center element of the $SU(2)$ subgroup which give rise to
the intermediate confinement in the static potentials.

to develop secure and resilient DSVM algorithms under adversarial environments

We establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the conflicting interests
between an adversary and a set of distributed data processing units. The Nash
equilibrium of the game allows predicting the outcome of learning algorithms in
adversarial environments, and enhancing the resilience of the machine learning
through dynamic distributed learning algorithms. We prove that the convergence
of the distributed algorithm is guaranteed without assumptions on the training

the results. We show that network topology plays an important role in the

fluctuations on efficiency correction for cumulant analysis in relativistic
heavy-ion collision experiments. Experimentally, particle efficiencies of
events measured under different experimental conditions should be different.
For fluctuation measurements, the final event-by-event multiplicity
distributions should be the superposed distributions of various type of events
measured under different conditions. We demonstrate efficiency fluctuation
effects using numerical simulation, in which we construct an event ensemble
consisting of events with two different efficiencies. By using the mean
particle efficiencies, we find that the efficiency corrected cumulants show
large deviations from the original inputs when the discrepancy between the two
efficiencies is large. We further studied the effects of efficiency
fluctuations for the cumulants of net-proton distributions by implementing the
UrQMD events of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV in a realistic STAR
detector acceptance. We consider the unequal efficiency in two sides of the
Time Projection Chamber (TPC), multiplicity dependent efficiency, and the
event-by-event variations of the collision vertex position along the
longitudinal direction ($V_\mathrm{z}$). When the efficiencies fluctuate
dramatically within the studied event sample, the effects of efficiency
fluctuations have significant impacts on the efficiency corrections of
cumulants with the mean efficiency. We find that this effect can be effectively
suppressed by binning the entire event ensemble into various sub-event samples,
in which the efficiency variations are relatively small. The final efficiency
corrected cumulants can be calculated from the weighted average of the
corrected factorial moments of the sub-event samples with the mean efficiency.

bivariate analyses, we found high correlations between GSV counts of cyclists

emitted from the cathode. Mechanisms discussed in literature are UV-emission
from neutral molecules, emission by positive ions reaching the cathode, and
back-scattering of excited neutrals. For a measurement up to $500\,$Td and
pressures up to $2\,$kPa we model different sources, and agree with previous
findings that the observed secondary emission is purely due to ultra-violet

sets the quality for each task independently. Moreover, in practice, the

combustion explosion limit. Then, H2 and O2 react extremely quickly to form
water together with modest amounts of hydrogen peroxide. These processes set
constraints for H2 O2 atmospheric compositions in Super Earth atmospheres. Our
initial study of the gas-phase oxidation pathways for modest conditions with
Earth insolation and about a tenth of a percent of H2 suggests that H2 is
oxidized by O2 into H2O mostly via HOx and mixed HOx NOx catalyzed cycles.
Regarding other atmospheric species-pairs we find that CO,O2 mixtures could
attain explosive combustive levels on mini gas planets for mid range for the C
to O ratio in the equilibrium chemistry regime for p more than about 1bar.
Regarding CH4,O2 mixtures, a small number of modeled rocky planets assuming
Earth like atmospheres orbiting cooler stars could have compositions at or near
the explosive combustive level although more work is required to investigate
this issue.

planar (u,v) velocity distribution depends on metallicity and on viewing
direction within the Galaxy. In nearby stars, with distance d < 1 kpc, the
Hercules stream is most strongly seen in higher metallicity stars [Fe/H] > 0.2.
The Hercules stream peak v value depends on viewed galactic longitude, which we
interpret as due to the gap between the stellar stream and more circular orbits
being associated with a specific angular momentum value of about 1640 km/s kpc.
The association of the gap with a particular angular momentum value supports a
bar resonant model for the Hercules stream.
  Moving groups previously identified in Hipparcos observations are easiest to
see in stars nearer than 250 pc, and their visibility and peak velocities in
the velocity distributions depends on both viewing direction (galactic
longitude and hemisphere) and metallicity. We infer that there is fine
structure in local velocity distributions that varies over distances of a few
hundred pc in the Galaxy.

investigations in recent years. In this work, we prove exactly that the

independent of time in symmetry preserving dynamics. We first reach this
conclusion by a direct relation between the time derivative of Berry connection
and the Hamiltonian energy based on the time dependent Hellman-Feynman theorem,
with which we show exactly that the topological indexes for systems without and
with time reversal symmetry are unchanged during evolution. In contrast, the
geometry phase without symmetry protection in a closed parameter space can
change dramtically with time, as revealed from the parameterized Landau-Zener
model. Then we interpret this result by showing that the time dependent wave
function is essentially the eigenvector of an auxiliary Hamiltonian, which has
exactly the same spectra and symmetries as the original Hamiltonian. For this
reason, the adiabatic evolution between the original and auxiliary Hamiltonian
will not lead to gap closing and reopening, thus the topological indexes are
independent of time. This result has generality and can be applied to models
with other symmetries and dimensions, and may even be applied to gapless
phases. Finally, possible ways to outreach this rigorous result are discussed.

Control (n=15), SHAM (n=9), MCAO (n=13), MCAO-D1 (n=7), MOD (n=13) and HIT
(n=13). Incremental tests were performed at day 1 (D1) and 14 (D14) to identify
the running speed associated with the lactate threshold (SLT) and the maximal

Results-HIT was more effective to improve the endurance performance than MOD
and induced a fast recovery of the impaired forelimb grip force. The Iba-1

loss function and nonconvex regularizer are widely used in machine learning and
pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a class of mini-batch stochastic
ADMMs (alternating direction method of multipliers) for solving large-scale
nonconvex nonsmooth problems. We prove that, given an appropriate mini-batch
size, the mini-batch stochastic ADMM without variance reduction (VR) technique
is convergent and reaches a convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ to obtain a stationary
point of the nonconvex optimization, where $T$ denotes the number of
iterations. Moreover, we extend the mini-batch stochastic gradient method to
both the nonconvex SVRG-ADMM and SAGA-ADMM proposed in our initial manuscript
\cite{huang2016stochastic}, and prove these mini-batch stochastic ADMMs also
reaches the convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ without condition on the mini-batch
size. In particular, we provide a specific parameter selection for step size
$\eta$ of stochastic gradients and penalty parameter $\rho$ of augmented
Lagrangian function. Finally, extensive experimental results on both simulated

to large cascades that span a substantial share of all nodes? Predicting the
final cascade size is critical to ensure the functioning of a system as a
whole. Yet, this task is hampered by uncertain or changing parameters and
missing information. In infinitely large networks, the average cascade size can
often be well estimated by established approaches building on local tree
approximations and mean field approximations. Yet, as we demonstrate, in finite
networks, this average does not even need to be a likely outcome. Instead, we
find broad and even bimodal cascade size distributions. This phenomenon
persists for system sizes up to $10^{7}$ and different cascade models, i.e. it
is relevant for most real systems. To show this, we derive explicit closed-form
solutions for the full probability distribution of the final cascade size. We
focus on two topological limit cases, the complete network representing a dense
network with a very narrow degree distribution, and the star network
representing a sparse network with a inhomogeneous degree distribution. Those
topologies are of great interest, as they either minimize or maximize the
average cascade size and are common motifs in many real world networks.

statistical detection of highly-redshifted HI emission from the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR). The chromaticity of the instrument creates a boundary in
the Fourier transform of frequency (proportional to $k_\parallel$) between
spectrally smooth emission, characteristic of the strong synchrotron foreground
(the ""wedge""), and the spectrally structured emission from HI in the EoR (the
""EoR window""). Faraday rotation can inject spectral structure into otherwise
smooth polarized foreground emission, which through instrument effects or
miscalibration could possibly pollute the EoR window. Using data from the HERA
19-element commissioning array, we investigate the polarization response of
this new instrument in the power spectrum domain. We perform a simple
image-based calibration based on the unpolarized diffuse emission of the Global
Sky Model, and show that it achieves qualitative redundancy between the
nominally-redundant baselines of the array and reasonable amplitude accuracy.
We construct power spectra of all fully polarized coherencies in all
pseudo-Stokes parameters. We compare to simulations based on an unpolarized
diffuse sky model and detailed electromagnetic simulations of the dish and
feed, confirming that in Stokes I, the calibration does not add significant
spectral structure beyond the expected level. Further, this calibration is
stable over the 8 days of observations considered. Excess power is seen in the
power spectra of the linear polarization Stokes parameters which is not easily
attributable to leakage via the primary beam, and results from some combination
of residual calibration errors and actual polarized emission. Stokes V is found
to be highly discrepant from the expectation of zero power, strongly pointing
to the need for more accurate polarized calibration.

high-dimensional models are inherently difficult, i.e. when observations are
sparse or expensive to determine. One way to address this problem is to
approximate the original model with fewer input dimensions. Our project goal
was to recover a function f that takes n inputs and returns one output, where n
is potentially large. For any given n-tuple, we assume that we can observe a
sample of the gradient and output of the function but it is computationally
expensive to do so. This project was inspired by an approach known as Active
Subspaces, which works by linearly projecting to a linear subspace where the
function changes most on average. Our research gives mathematical developments
informing a novel algorithm for this problem. Our approach, Active Manifolds,
increases accuracy by seeking nonlinear analogues that approximate the

knowledge based on domain patterns. As part of the framework, we present
ontologies for modeling goals, instructional processes and instructional

  arXiv:1708.03100",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper we obtain approximate bound state solutions of $N$-dimensional
time independent fractional Schr\""{o}dinger equation for generalised
pseudoharmonic potential which has the form
$V(r^{\alpha})=a_1r^{2\alpha}+\frac{a_2}{r^{2\alpha}}+a_3$. Here
$\alpha(0<\alpha<1)$ acts like a fractional parameter for the space variable
$r$. The entire study is composed with the Jumarie type derivative and the
elegance of Laplace transform. As a result we successfully able to express the
approximate bound state solution in terms of Mittag-Leffler function and
fractionally defined confluent hypergeometric function. Our study may be
treated as a generalization of all previous works carried out on this topic
when $\alpha=1$ and $N$ arbitrary. We provide numerical result of energy
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a typical diatomic molecule for different
$\alpha$ close to unity. Finally, we try to correlate our work with Cornell
potential model which corresponds to $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$ with $a_3=0$ and
predict the approximate mass spectra of quarkonia.

numerical methods with the orders 2.0 and 2.5 of convergence for Ito stochastic
differential equations with multidimensional non-commutative noise. We consider
the numerical methods based on the unified Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich
expansions. For the numerical modeling of iterated Ito and Stratonovich
stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 5 we apply the method of multiple
Fourier-Legendre series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space
$L_2([t, T]^k),$ $k=1,\ldots,5$. The article is addressed to engineers who use
numerical modeling in stochastic control and for solving the non-linear
filtering problem. The article will be interesting to scientists who working in
the field of numerical integration of stochastic differential equations.

briefly explore the design-space of these patterns, and report on the discovery
of an interesting fractal subdivision of space by iterative circle packings. We
devise two different ways for creating this fractal, both showing interesting
properties, some resembling properties of the dragon curve. The patterns

  Demand, and Traffic Assignment",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integrating land use, travel demand, and traffic models represents a gold
standard for regional planning, but is rarely achieved in a meaningful way,
especially at the scale of disaggregate data. In this report, we present a new
pipeline architecture for integrated modeling of urban land use, travel demand,
and traffic assignment. Our land use model, UrbanSim, is an open-source
microsimulation platform used by metropolitan planning organizations worldwide
for modeling the growth and development of cities over long (~30 year) time
horizons. UrbanSim is particularly powerful as a scenario analysis tool,
enabling planners to compare and contrast the impacts of different policy
decisions on long term land use forecasts in a statistically rigorous way. Our
travel demand model, ActivitySim, is an agent-based modeling platform that
produces synthetic origin--destination travel demand data. Finally, we use a
static user equilibrium traffic assignment model based on the Frank-Wolfe
algorithm to assign vehicles to specific network paths to make trips between
origins and destinations. This traffic assignment model runs in a
high-performance computing environment. The resulting congested travel time
data can then be fed back into UrbanSim and ActivitySim for the next model run.
This technical report introduces this research area, describes this project's
achievements so far in developing this integrated pipeline, and presents an
upcoming research agenda.

execution of allocated tasks during run-time becomes crucial. This is so
because, in a real world, there can be several physical tasks that use shared
resources that need to be executed concurrently. In this paper, we propose a
mechanism to solve this issue of ordering task executions within a CPS which
inherently handles mutual exclusion. The mechanism caters to a decentralized
and distributed CPS comprising nodes such as computers, robots and sensor
nodes, and uses mobile software agents that knit through them to aid the
execution of the various tasks while also ensuring mutual exclusion of shared
resources. The computations, communications and control, are achieved through
these mobile agents. Physical execution of the tasks is performed by the robots
in an asynchronous and pipelined manner without the use of a clock. The
mechanism also features addition and deletion of tasks and insertion and
removal of robots facilitating \textit{On-The-Fly Programming}. As an
application, a Warehouse Management System as a CPS has been implemented. The
paper concludes with the results and discussions on using the mechanism in both
emulated and real world environments.
