  Neural Network approach",,,"10.1002/nbm.4225",,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The suppression of motion artefacts from MR images is a challenging
task. The purpose of this paper is to develop a standalone novel technique to
suppress motion artefacts from MR images using a data-driven deep learning
approach. Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was
developed to remove motion artefacts in brain MR images. A CNN was trained on
simulated motion corrupted images to identify and suppress artefacts due to the
motion. The network was an encoder-decoder CNN architecture where the encoder
decomposed the motion corrupted images into a set of feature maps. The feature
maps were then combined by the decoder network to generate a motion-corrected
image. The network was tested on an unseen simulated dataset and an
experimental, motion corrupted in vivo brain dataset. Results: The trained
network was able to suppress the motion artefacts in the simulated motion
corrupted images, and the mean percentage error in the motion corrected images
was 2.69 % with a standard deviation of 0.95 %. The network was able to
effectively suppress the motion artefacts from the experimental dataset,
demonstrating the generalisation capability of the trained network. Conclusion:
A novel and generic motion correction technique has been developed that can
suppress motion artefacts from motion corrupted MR images. The proposed
technique is a standalone post-processing method that does not interfere with
data acquisition or reconstruction parameters, thus making it suitable for a
multitude of MR sequences.

biclustering high dimensional gene expression data to identify block patterns
with similar expressions. However, these models do not take into account prior
group effects upon variable selection. To this end, we first propose
group-sparse SVD models with group Lasso (GL1-SVD) and group L0-norm penalty
(GL0-SVD) for non-overlapping group structure of variables. However, such
group-sparse SVD models limit their applicability in some problems with
overlapping structure. Thus, we also propose two group-sparse SVD models with
overlapping group Lasso (OGL1-SVD) and overlapping group L0-norm penalty
(OGL0-SVD). We first adopt an alternating iterative strategy to solve GL1-SVD
based on a block coordinate descent method, and GL0-SVD based on a projection
method. The key of solving OGL1-SVD is a proximal operator with overlapping
group Lasso penalty. We employ an alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) to solve the proximal operator. Similarly, we develop an approximate
method to solve OGL0-SVD. Applications of these methods and comparison with
competing ones using simulated data demonstrate their effectiveness. Extensive
applications of them onto several real gene expression data with gene prior
group knowledge identify some biologically interpretable gene modules.

Moreover, we also significantly extend a popular video summarization dataset by
1) more egocentric videos, 2) dense user annotations, and 3) a refined

essential ingredients of an intelligent nano receiver---modulation mode
detection (to differentiate between pulse based modulation and carrier based
modulation), and modulation classification (to identify the exact modulation
scheme in use). To implement modulation mode detection, we construct a binary
hypothesis test in nano-receiver's passband, and provide closed-form
expressions for the two error probabilities. As for modulation classification,
we aim to represent the received signal of interest by a Gaussian mixture model
(GMM). This necessitates the explicit estimation of the THz channel impulse
response, and its subsequent compensation (via deconvolution). We then learn
the GMM parameters via Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We then do Gaussian
approximation of each mixture density to compute symmetric Kullback-Leibler
divergence in order to differentiate between various modulation schemes (i.e.,
$M$-ary phase shift keying, $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation). The
simulation results on mode detection indicate that there exists a unique
Pareto-optimal point (for both SNR and the decision threshold) where both error
probabilities are minimized. The main takeaway message by the simulation
results on modulation classification is that for a pre-specified probability of
correct classification, higher SNR is required to correctly identify a higher
order modulation scheme.
  On a broader note, this work should trigger the interest of the community in
the design of intelligent/cognitive nano receivers (capable of performing
various intelligent tasks, e.g., modulation prediction etc.).

settling energy contracts among prosumers in a Residential Energy Cooperative
(REC) considering heterogeneous prosumer preferences. The heterogeneity arises
from prosumers' evaluation of energy contracts through multiple societal and
environmental criteria and the prosumers' private preferences over those
criteria. The prosumers engage in bilateral negotiations with peers to mutually
agree on periodical energy contracts/loans that consist of an energy volume to
be exchanged at that period and the return time of the exchanged energy. The
prosumers keep an ordered preference profile of possible energy contracts by
evaluating the contracts from their own valuations on the entailed criteria,
and iteratively offer the peers contracts until an agreement is formed. A
prosumer embeds the valuations into a utility function that further considers
uncertainties imposed by demand and generation profiles. Empirical evaluation
on real demand, generation and storage profiles illustrates that the proposed
negotiation based strategy is able to increase the system efficiency (measured
by utilitarian social welfare) and fairness (measured by Nash social welfare)
over a baseline strategy and an individual flexibility control strategy. We
thus elicit system benefits from P2P flexibility exchange already with few
agents and without central coordination, providing a simple yet flexible and
effective paradigm that may complement existing markets.

of solar cycle 24 and a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event. The
eruption consisted of two M-class flares, with the first one being confined,
with no metric or interplanetary radio bursts. However, there was intense
microwave burst, indicating accelerated particles injected toward the Sun. The
second flare was eruptive that resulted in a halo CME. The CME was deflected
primarily by an equatorial coronal hole that resulted in the modification of
the intensity profile of the associated SEP event and the duration of the CME
at Earth. The interplanetary type II burst was particularly intense and was
visible from the corona all the way to the vicinity of the Wind spacecraft with
fundamental-harmonic structure. We computed the shock speed using the type II
drift rates at various heliocentric distances and obtained information on the
evolution of the shock that matched coronagraph observations near the Sun and

consistent with the 1-AU speed of the CME and the magnitude of the southward

the Quantum. The main point of this interpretation is that (unlike previous
interpretations) it is not actually an interpretation but rather a methodology
aimed to encourage a conceptually driven construction of a theory of Quantum
Gravity. In so doing we will, I hope, resolve the ontological problems that
come along with Quantum Theory. In the second part of this paper I offer a
particular perspective on the theory of General Relativity and set out a path
of seven steps and three elements corresponding (more-or-less) to the path that
Einstein took to this theory. In the third part I review a particular
operational approach to Quantum Field Theory I have been developing - the
operator tensor formulation. The physicality condition (this ensures that
probabilities are between 0 and 1 and that choices in the future cannot effect
the past) is discussed in some detail in this part and also in an appendix. In
the fourth part of the paper I set out one particular conceptually driven
possible road to Quantum Gravity. This approach works by establishing seven
steps and three elements for a theory of Quantum Gravity that are analogous to
those of General Relativity. The holy grail in this approach is to generalize
the physicality conditions from Quantum Field theory to the new situation we
find ourselves in in Quantum Gravity. Such conditions, in the present approach,
would be analogous to the Einstein Field Equations. In the fifth part of the
paper I propose the quantum equivalence principle whereby it is always possible
to transform to a quantum reference frame such that we have definite causal
structure in the vicinity of any given point. This equivalence principle
suggests another possible road (albeit more speculative) to Quantum Gravity in
even closer analogy to the path Einstein took to General Relativity.

formally reconcile new data and existing scientific information. However,
popular use of Bayesian methods often avoids priors that are based on exact
posterior distributions resulting from former studies. Two existing Recursive
Bayesian methods are: Prior- and Proposal-Recursive Bayes. Prior-Recursive
Bayes uses Bayesian updating, fitting models to partitions of data
sequentially, and provides a way to accommodate new data as they become
available using the posterior from the previous stage as the prior in the new
stage based on the latest data. Proposal-Recursive Bayes is intended for use
with hierarchical Bayesian models and uses a set of transient priors in first
stage independent analyses of the data partitions. The second stage of
Proposal-Recursive Bayes uses the posteriors from the first stage as proposals
in an MCMC algorithm to fit the full model. We combine Prior- and
Proposal-Recursive concepts to fit any Bayesian model, and often with
computational improvements. We demonstrate our method with two case studies.

  That advance might naturally make one wonder about a quite different
potential consequence of NP-completeness: Can the union of easy NP sets ever be
hard? In particular, can the union of two non-NP-complete NP sets ever be
NP-complete?
  Amazingly, Ladner [Lad75] resolved this more than forty years ago: If P
$\neq$ NP, then all NP-complete sets can be simply split into two
non-NP-complete NP sets. Indeed, this holds even when one requires the two
non-NP-complete NP sets to be disjoint.
  We present this result as a mini-tutorial. We give a relatively detailed
proof of this result, using the same technique and idea Ladner [Lad75] invented
and used in proving a rich collection of results that include many that are
more general than this result: delayed diagonalization. In particular, the
proof presented is based on what one can call team diagonalization (or if one
is being playful, perhaps even tag-team diagonalization): Multiple sets are
formed separately by delayed diagonalization, yet those diagonalizations are
mutually aware and delay some of their actions until their partner(s) have also
succeeded in some coordinated action.
  We relatedly note that, as a consequence of Ladner's result, if P $\neq$ NP,
there exist OptP functions f and g whose composition is NP-hard yet neither f
nor g is NP-hard.

80 spectral points in a 100-nm bandwidth centered around 810 nm. The device is
composed of three different reflective dielectric metasurfaces, all fabricated
in a single lithographic step on one side of a transparent optical substrate,
which simultaneously acts as the propagation space for light. An image sensor,
parallel to the spectrometer substrate, can be directly integrated on top of it
to achieve a compact mono- lithic device including all the active and passive
components. Multiple spectrometers, with similar or different characteristics
and operation bandwidths may also be integrated on the same chip and fabricated
in a batch process, significantly reducing their costs and increas- ing their
functionalities and integration potential. In addition, the folded metasystems
design can be applied to many optical systems, such as optical signal
processors, interferometers, hyperspectral imagers and computational optical
systems, significantly reducing their sizes and increasing their mechanical

video can be seen by the observer through head movement (HM), and an even
smaller region within the viewport can be clearly perceived through eye
movement (EM). Thus, the subjective quality of omnidirectional video may be
correlated with HM and EM of human behavior. To fill in the gap between
subjective quality and human behavior, this paper proposes a large-scale visual
quality assessment (VQA) dataset of omnidirectional video, called VQA-OV, which
collects 60 reference sequences and 540 impaired sequences. Our VQA-OV dataset
provides not only the subjective quality scores of sequences but also the HM

develop a deep learning model, which embeds HM and EM, for objective VQA on

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1807.10991",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A nonlocal response theory was developed to describe a many-electron system
within the neighborhood of a nanostructure radiating the longitudinal and
transverse electric fields, which are fundamentally reduced to the scalar and
vector potentials (SP and VP). The coexistence of the SP and VP incidences
distinguishes such a near-field optical system from the ordinary optical
system, in which only the VP (under the Coulomb gauge) incidence survives far
from the light source. This fact is the motivation for equal treatment of the
SP and VP as the cause of the response in the near-field optical system. In the
semiclassical treatment, the linear and nonlinear single susceptibilities are
derived in the form of Heisenberg operators by the functional derivatives of
the action integral of the matter with respect to the SP and VP. These single
susceptibilities relate the SP and VP (as the cause) to the induced charge and
current densities (as the result), and guarantee charge conservation and gauge
invariance; this theory is free from gauge-fixing. It is necessary to consider
the quantum many-electron effect (exchange-correlation effect) to make the
ground state bounded in the non-perturbed system. This is done by employing the
fundamental idea of density functional theory, instead of the ordinary unequal
treatment of the SP and VP, that is, remaking the SP into a Coulomb interaction
between electron charges. Applying the present linear response theory to the
non-metallic material in a limited near-field optical system reveals that the
electric field with the associated permittivity is not suitable quantity to
describe the response, instead, the SP and VP with associate single
susceptibility are essential.

thermodynamic equilibrium depends on the particular quantum stress-energy
tensor operator chosen, e.g., the canonical or symmetrized Belinfante
stress-energy tensor. We argue that the Belinfante tensor is not appropriate to
describe a relativistic fluid whose macroscopic polarization relaxes slowly to
thermodynamic equilibrium and that a spin tensor, like the canonical spin
tensor, is required. As a consequence, the description of a polarized
relativistic fluid involves an extension of relativistic hydrodynamics
including a new antisymmetric rank-two tensor as a dynamical field. We show
that the canonical and Belinfante tensors lead to different predictions for
measurable quantities such as spectrum and polarization of particles produced
in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Moreover, a second transition into a spatially modulated proper-screw magnetic

23Na NMR spin-lattice relaxation identifies a magnetically inhomogene-ous state

TN2 indicates that a spin-gap opens in the excitation spectrum. High-resolution
neutron inelastic scattering confirms that the magnetic dynamics are indeed
gapped ({\Delta}~5 meV) in the low-temperature magnetic phase, while
simulations on the basis of the single-mode approximation suggest that Mn-spins

fundamental resources in various quantum information processing tasks.
Consequently, generating more resources from a few, typically termed as
broadcasting is a task of utmost significance. One such strategy of
broadcasting is through the application of cloning machines. In this article,
broadcasting of quantum resources beyond $2 \otimes 2$ systems is investigated.
In particular, in $2\otimes3$ dimension, a class of states not useful for
broadcasting of entanglement is characterized for a choice of optimal universal
Heisenberg cloning machine. The broadcasting ranges for maximally entangled
mixed states (MEMS) and two parameter class of states (TPCS) are obtained to
exemplify our protocol. A significant derivative of the protocol is the
generation of entangled states with positive partial transpose in $3 \otimes 3$
dimension and states which are absolutely separable in $2 \otimes 2$ dimension.
Moving beyond entanglement, in $2 \otimes d$ dimension, the impossibility to
optimally broadcast quantum correlations beyond entanglement (QCsbE) (discord)
and quantum coherence ($l_{1}$-norm) is established. However, some significant
illustrations are provided to highlight that non-optimal broadcasting of QCsbE
and coherence are still possible.

(GW) signals from merging supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses below
$10^7$~M$_{\odot}$. It is thus of paramount importance to understand the
orbital dynamics of these relatively light central BHs, which typically reside
in disc-dominated galaxies, in order to produce reliable forecasts of merger
rates. To this aim, realistic simulations probing BH dynamics in unequal-mass
disc galaxy mergers, into and beyond the binary hardening stage, are performed
by combining smooth particle hydrodynamics and direct $N$-body codes. The
structural properties and orbits of the galaxies are chosen to be consistent
with the results of galaxy formation simulations. Stellar and dark matter
distributions are triaxial down to the central 100 pc of merger remnant. In all
cases, a BH binary forms and hardens on time-scales of at most 100~Myr,
coalescing on another few hundred Myr time-scale, depending on the
characteristic density and orbital eccentricity. Overall, the sinking of the BH
binary takes no more than $\sim$0.5~Gyr after the merger of the two galaxies is
completed, but can be much faster for very plunging orbits. Comparing with
previous numerical simulations following the decay of BHs in massive early-type
galaxies at $z \sim 3$, we confirm that the characteristic density is the most
crucial parameter determining the overall BH merging time-scale, despite the
structural diversity of the host galaxies. Our results lay down the basis for
robust forecasts of LISA event rates in the case of merging BHs.

  Aims:We test the effectiveness of the selection criteria defined on the 4D

description of their UV spectra in the redshift range 2<z<2.9.
  Methods:19 extreme quasar candidates were identified using 4DE1 selection
criteria applied to SDSS spectra: AlIII1860/SiIII]1892>0.5 and
CIII]1909/SiIII]1892<1. The emission line spectra was studied using
multicomponent fits of deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the

  Results:Spectra confirm that almost all of these quasars are xA sources with

be characterized as very low ionization (logU~-3), a condition that explains
the significant FeIII emission. CIV1549 shows low equivalent width (<30 A for
the most sources), and high or extreme blueshift amplitudes (-5000<c(1/2)<-1000
kms-1). Weak-lined quasars appear as extreme xA quasars and not as an
independent class. The CIV1549 high amplitude blueshifts coexists in all cases
save one with symmetric and narrower AlIII and SiIII] profiles. Estimates of
the Eddington ratio using the AlIII FWHM as a virial broadening estimator are
consistent with the ones of a previous xA sample.
  Conclusions:It is now feasible to assemble large samples of xA quasars from
the latest data releases of the SDSS. We provide evidence that AlIII1860 could
be associated with a low-ionization virialized sub-system, supporting previous
suggestions that AlIII is a reliable virial broadening estimator.

typically based on a time discretization which is projected on a fixed

restricted usages such as usages on always-on devices, battery-powered low-end
devices, etc. This paper considers the resource and accuracy trade-off for
resource-restricted usages during designing the whole object detection
framework. Based on the deeply supervised object detection (DSOD) framework, we
propose Tiny-DSOD dedicating to resource-restricted usages. Tiny-DSOD
introduces two innovative and ultra-efficient architecture blocks: depthwise
dense block (DDB) based backbone and depthwise feature-pyramid-network (D-FPN)
based front-end. We conduct extensive experiments on three famous benchmarks
(PASCAL VOC 2007, KITTI, and COCO), and compare Tiny-DSOD to the
state-of-the-art ultra-efficient object detection solutions such as Tiny-YOLO,
MobileNet-SSD (v1 & v2), SqueezeDet, Pelee, etc. Results show that Tiny-DSOD
outperforms these solutions in all the three metrics (parameter-size, FLOPs,
accuracy) in each comparison. For instance, Tiny-DSOD achieves 72.1% mAP with
only 0.95M parameters and 1.06B FLOPs, which is by far the state-of-the-arts
result with such a low resource requirement.

scores. In this paper, we are specifically interested in the recent surge in
crowdsourcing applications to predict partial but more accurate (i.e., making
less incorrect statements) orders rather than complete ones. To do so, we
propose a novel framework to learn some probabilistic models of partial orders
as a \emph{margin-based Maximum Likelihood Estimate} (MLE) method. We prove
that the induced MLE is a joint convex optimization problem with respect to all
the parameters, including the global ranking scores and margin parameter.
Moreover, three kinds of generalized linear models are studied, including the
basic uniform model, Bradley-Terry model, and Thurstone-Mosteller model,
equipped with some theoretical analysis on FDR and Power control for the
proposed methods. The validity of these models are supported by experiments
with both simulated and real-world datasets, which shows that the proposed

both theoretically and experimentally that a structured phase-change alloy
Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) can support a diverse set of multipolar Mie resonances
with active tunability and switchability. By harnessing the dramatic optical

realize continuous switching between a scattering bright state (electric dipole

switching effects are also systematically investigated, which naturally make
the structured GST serve as a multispectral optical switch with high extinction

On the other hand, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the
multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems
introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as
encryption, authentication, access control, network security and application
security, for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective.
Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to secure the IoT
system effectively. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced

from laboratory curiosity to practical machinery in several important

security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between
devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to
provide a comprehensive survey of ML /DL methods that can be used to develop
enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are
related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various
potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each
surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security
and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We

the nonlinear eigenvalues determine the global qualitative behaviour of a

this fact to construct a nonlinear dynamical system of which the trajectories

doubling cascade of periodic attractors. Chaotic attractors are presumably of

neural networks, because these networks excel at handling complex patterns in
images. In these models, second-order statistics, such as Gram matrix, are used
to describe textures. Despite the fact that these model have achieved promising
results, the structure of their parametric space is still unclear,
consequently, it is difficult to use them to mix textures. This paper addresses
the texture mixing problem by using a Gaussian scheme to interpolate deep
statistics computed from deep neural networks. More precisely, we first reveal
that the statistics used in existing deep models can be unified using a
stationary Gaussian scheme. We then present a novel algorithm to mix these
statistics by interpolating between Gaussian models using optimal transport. We
further apply our scheme to Neural Style Transfer, where we can create mixed
styles. The experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve
state-of-the-art results. Because all the computations are implemented in
closed forms, our mixing algorithm adds only negligible time to the original

theoretical approach explains human fallacies as the consequence of genuine
quantum structures in human reasoning, i.e. `contextuality', `emergence',

networks consisting of nodes and edges. For instance, in social systems
individuals can have social ties, family or financial relationships. In
settings where some units are exposed to a treatment and its effect spills over
connected units, estimating both the direct effect of the treatment and
spillover effects presents several challenges. First, assumptions on the way
and the extent to which spillover effects occur along the observed network are
required. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment is
not under the control of the investigator, confounding and homophily are
potential threats to the identification and estimation of causal effects on
networks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: i) neighborhood
interference, which assumes interference operates only through a function of
the immediate neighbors' treatments ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and
neighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding
variables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we
develop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for treatment and spillover
effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a
generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood
covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of
exposure to neighbors' treatment. Adjustment for propensity score is performed
using a penalized spline regression. Inference capitalizes on a three-step
Bayesian procedure which allows to take into account the uncertainty in the
propensity score estimation and avoiding model feedback. Finally, correlation
of interacting units is taken into account using a community detection
algorithm and incorporating random effects in the outcome model.

demarcation between dangerous and unusual weapons that are not permissible to
own and weapons protected by the Second Amendment. Cyber weapons take the form
of dual-use software, often shared and globally distributed that in most cases
can be weaponized for harmful purposes. In recent years, major corporations
have sought to hack back, and if the hack back is authorized, the question
becomes whether corporations have digital gun rights. Even if corporations are

on the space of spinor variables, which combine helicity amplitudes in any
four-dimensional gauge theory as a single object. In this note we focus on such
differential forms in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM, which can also be thought of as
""bosonizing"" superamplitudes in non-chiral superspace. Remarkably all
tree-level amplitudes in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM combine to a $d\log$ form in spinor
variables, which is given by pushforward of canonical forms of Grassmannian
cells, the tree forms can also be obtained using BCFW or inverse-soft
construction, and we present all-multiplicity expression for MHV and NMHV forms
to illustrate their simplicity. Similarly all-loop planar integrands can be
naturally written as $d\log$ forms in the Grassmannian/on-shell-diagram
picture, and we expect the same to hold beyond the planar limit. Just as the
form in momentum twistor space reveals underlying positive geometry of the
amplituhedron, the form in terms of spinor variables strongly suggests an
""amplituhedron in momentum space"". We initiate the study of its geometry by
connecting it to the moduli space of Witten's twistor-string theory, which
provides a pushforward formula for tree forms in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM.

application. In modern day, OAuth 2.0 framework and OpenID Connect protocol are
widely adopted standards fulfilling these requirements. These protocols are
implemented into authorization servers. It is common to call these
authorization servers as identity servers or identity providers since they hold
user identity information. Applications registered to an identity provider can
use OpenID Connect to retrieve ID token for authentication. Access token
obtained along with ID token allows the application to consume OAuth 2.0
protected resources. In this approach, the client application is bound to a
single identity provider. If the client needs to consume a protected resource
from a different domain, which only accepts tokens of a defined identity
provider, then the client must again follow OpenID Connect protocol to obtain
new tokens. This requires user identity details to be stored in the second
identity provider as well. This paper proposes an extension to OpenID Connect
protocol to overcome this issue. It proposes a client-centric mechanism to
exchange identity information as token grants against a trusted identity
provider. Once a grant is accepted, resulting token response contains an access
token, which is good enough to access protected resources from token issuing
identity provider's domain.

regarded as a promising way to achieve interactivity in big data analytics. To
build such an AQP system, finding the minimal sample size for a query regarding
given error constraints in general, called Sample Size Optimization (SSO), is
an essential yet unsolved problem. Ideally, the goal of solving the SSO problem
is to achieve statistical accuracy, computational efficiency and broad
applicability all at the same time. Existing approaches either make idealistic
assumptions on the statistical properties of the query, or completely disregard
them. This may result in overemphasizing only one of the three goals while
neglect the others.
  To overcome these limitations, we first examine carefully the statistical
properties shared by common analytical queries. Then, based on the properties,
we propose a linear model describing the relationship between sample sizes and
the approximation errors of a query, which is called the error model. Then, we
propose a Model-guided Iterative Sample Selection (MISS) framework to solve the
SSO problem generally. Afterwards, based on the MISS framework, we propose a
concrete algorithm, called $L^2$Miss, to find optimal sample sizes under the
$L^2$ norm error metric. Moreover, we extend the $L^2$Miss algorithm to handle
other error metrics. Finally, we show theoretically and empirically that the
$L^2$Miss algorithm and its extensions achieve satisfactory accuracy and
efficiency for a considerably wide range of analytical queries.

of dynamics to achieve a desired planar formation. Our approach is based on the
barycentric-coordinate-based (BCB) control, which is fully distributed, does
not require inter-agent communication or a common sense of orientation, and can
be implemented using relative position measurements acquired by agents in their
local coordinate frames. This removes the need for global positioning or
alignment of local coordinate frames, which are required across several
existing strategies. We show how the BCB control for agents with the simplest
dynamical model, i.e., the single-integrator dynamics, can be extended to
agents with higher-order dynamics such as quadrotors, and nonholonomic agents
such as unicycles and cars. Specifically, our extension preserves the desired
convergence and robustness guarantees of the BCB approach and is provably
robust to saturations in the input and unmodeled linear actuator dynamics for
unicycle and car agents. We further show that under our proposed BCB control
design, the agents can move along a rotated and scaled control direction
without affecting the convergence to the desired formation. This observation is
used to design a fully distributed collision avoidance strategy, which is often
not considered in the formation control literature. We demonstrate the proposed
approach in simulations and further present a distributed robotic platform to
test the strategy experimentally. Our experimental platform consists of
off-the-shelf equipment that can be used to test and validate other multi-agent

performance enhancement under diverse network conditions. However, with respect
to losses, little can be achieved with legacy TCP detection and recovery
mechanisms. Both fast retransmission and retransmission timeout take at least
one extra round trip time to perform, and this might significantly impact
performance of latency-sensitive applications, especially in lossy or high
delay networks. While forward error correction (FEC) is not a new initiative in
this direction, the majority of the approaches consider FEC inside the
application. In this paper, we design and implement a framework, where FEC is
integrated within TCP. Our main goal with this design choice is to enable
latency sensitive applications over TCP in high delay and lossy networks, but
remaining application agnostic. We further incorporate this design into
multipath TCP (MPTCP), where we focus particularly on heterogeneous settings,
considering the fact that TCP recovery mechanisms further escalate head-of-line
blocking in multipath. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework
and show that such a framework can bring significant benefits compared to
legacy TCP and MPTCP for latency-sensitive real application traffic, such as
video streaming and web services.

to the zero net magnetization, the reading of information from the SAF

the other had an anisotropic DMI. This difference of DMIs resulted in the
opposite tilting directions of the DW planes in the two layers. This tilting
was inhibited by a strong interlayer FM coupling, resulting in an increase in
the DW velocity and the reduction of the minimum allowed spacing between two
adjacent DWs. In addition, the FM coupling enhanced the stray field, and the
stored information could be read conveniently using a conventional reading
head. Therefore, our proposal paves a way for the fabrication of a racetrack

  Electromagnetic Emission Mechanisms of TXS~0506+056","Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The association of the high-energy neutrino event IceCube-170922A with the
flaring blazar TXS~0506+056 indicates that hadronic processes may operate in a
blazar jet. We perform semi-analytical spectral fitting of the multi-wavelength
emission to obtain estimates of the jet physical parameters, and find that the
multi-wavelength emission can be explained by either a proton synchrotron
scenario or an electron inverse Compton scattering scenario. In the proton
synchrotron scenario, a strong magnetic field of $10-100$~G is required,
implying that the particle acceleration is likely driven by magnetic energy
dissipation such as magnetic reconnection events. The inverse Compton scenario
implies a magnetic field of $0.1-1$~G. Thus the particle acceleration is likely
driven by the kinetic energy dissipation such as shocks. We also discuss the
neutrino production in the context of single-zone and multi-zone models based
on the above two scenarios. We demonstrate that the variability and optical
polarization signatures can be used to distinguish the two scenarios due to
their drastically different magnetic field. Specifically, the proton
synchrotron scenario may show orphan fast variability in the low-energy
spectral component on top of the active state, with an optical polarization
degree $\lesssim 10\%$ throughout the active state. The inverse Compton
scattering scenario instead predicts co-variability of the low- and high-energy
components on both short and long time scales, as well as a strongly variable
optical polarization degree that can reach $\gtrsim 20\%$. Our results suggest
that optical polarization measurements and well-resolved multi-wavelength light
curves can be used to understand the electromagnetic and high-energy neutrino
emissions by TXS~0506+056 and similar events in the future.

abandoned or has closed-form solution to make it feasible to learn deep

the advances in CF models, and cannot achieve competitive accuracy in

the joint learning of deep representation and model adaptation, where an
updater network is introduced for better tracking on future frame by taking
current frame representation, tracking result, and last CF tracker as input. By
modeling the representor as convolutional neural network (CNN), we truncate the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and interpret it as a deep
network of updater, resulting in our model for learning representation and
truncated inference (RTINet). Experiments demonstrate that our RTINet tracker

navigation and visualisation of image-guided procedures. The technology
provides high tracking accuracy in non-line-of-sight environments, allowing
instrument navigation in locations where optical tracking is not feasible.
Integration of EMT in complex procedures, often coupled with multi-modal
imaging, is on the rise, yet the lack of exibility in the available hardware
platforms has been noted by many researchers and system designers. Advances in
the field of EMT include novel methods of improving tracking system accuracy,
precision and error compensation capabilities, though such system-level
improvements cannot be readily incorporated in current therapy applications due
to the `blackbox' nature of commercial tracking solving algorithms. This paper
defines a software framework to allow novel EMT designs and improvements become
part of the global design process for image-guided interventions. In an effort
to standardise EMT development, we define a generalised cross-platform software
framework in terms of the four system functions common to all EMT systems;
acquisition, filtering, modelling and solving. The interfaces between each
software component are defined in terms of their input and output data
structures. An exemplary framework is implemented in the Python programming
language and demonstrated with the open-source Anser EMT system. Performance
metrics are gathered from both Matlab and Python implementations of Anser EMT
considering the host operating system, hardware configuration and acquisition
settings used. Results show indicative system latencies of 5 ms can be achieved
using the framework on a Windows operating system, with decreased system
performance observed on UNIX-like platforms.

poor governance in many societies. Thus, understanding its causes has become a
priority of scholars across many disciplines. Here we demonstrate that shifts
in socialization strategies analogous to political polarization and identity
politics can arise as a locally-beneficial response to both rising wealth
inequality and economic decline. Adopting a perspective of cultural evolution,
we develop a framework to study the emergence of polarization under shifting
economic environments. In many contexts, interacting with diverse out-groups
confers benefits from innovation and exploration greater than those that arise
from interacting exclusively with a homogeneous in-group. However, when the
economic environment favors risk-aversion, a strategy of seeking low-risk
interactions can be important to maintaining individual solvency. To capture
this dynamic, we assume that in-group interactions have a lower expected
outcome, but a more certain one. Thus in-group interactions are less risky than
out-group interactions. Our model shows that under conditions of economic
decline or increasing wealth inequality, some members of the population benefit
from adopting a risk-averse, in-group favoring strategy. Moreover, we show that
such in-group polarization can spread rapidly to the whole population and
persist even when the conditions that produced it have reversed. Finally we
offer empirical support for the role of income inequality as a driver of
affective polarization in the United States, mirroring findings on a panel of
developed democracies. Our work provides a framework for studying how disparate
forces interplay, via cultural evolution, to shape patterns of identity, and
unifies what are often seen as conflicting explanations for political
polarization: identity threat versus economic anxiety.

history. In the last decades, there are photos with a similar configuration of
the earth observed from the moon and from space, as well as of all the planets
and their moons. The photos are all nearly uniform. Such images are considered
non-Lambertian since they do not comply with Lambert Cosine Law of light
scattering. Theories of the uniformity deal only with the moon. Apart from
being not persuasive for the moon case, they are not applicable to most other
cases. There are thousands of thousands of similar photos, but there is not a
single true photo that does comply with Lambert cosine Law. Photos that do
comply with the law are all ""rendered"", that is, at least partly simulated. A
calculation based on fundamental principles is presented to clarify the
uniformity in all cases regardless of the observed object and its surface
properties. The uniformity is a direct outcome of a single sunlight scattering
from the observed object, and there is no need of further assumptions or models
to justify it.

  Accurate results and applications","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1808.00372",,,,"math.CO cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph operations or products, such as triangulation and Kronecker product
have been extensively applied to model complex networks with striking
properties observed in real-world complex systems. In this paper, we study
hitting times and resistance distances of $q$-triangulation graphs. For a
simple connected graph $G$, its $q$-triangulation graph $R_q(G)$ is obtained
from $G$ by performing the $q$-triangulation operation on $G$. That is, for
every edge $uv$ in $G$, we add $q$ disjoint paths of length $2$, each having
$u$ and $v$ as its ends. We first derive the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
normalized adjacency matrix of $R_q(G)$, expressing them in terms of those
associated with $G$. Based on these results, we further obtain some interesting
quantities about random walks and resistance distances for $R_q(G)$, including
two-node hitting time, Kemeny's constant, two-node resistance distance,
Kirchhoff index, additive degree-Kirchhoff index, and multiplicative
degree-Kirchhoff index. Finally, we provide exact formulas for the
aforementioned quantities of iterated $q$-triangulation graphs, using which we
provide closed-form expressions for those quantities corresponding to a class
of scale-free small-world graphs, which has been applied to mimic complex
networks.

Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that jointly segments the Optic

structural features obtained from the OD-OC segmentation to obtain a robust
prediction. The use of fewer network parameters and the sharing of the CNN
features for multiple related tasks ensures the good generalizability of the
architecture, allowing it to be trained on small training sets. The
cross-testing performance of the proposed method on an independent validation
set acquired using a different camera and image resolution was found to be good
with an average dice score of 0.92 for OD, 0.84 for OC and AUC of 0.95 on the
task of glaucoma classification illustrating its potential as a mass screening
tool for the early detection of glaucoma.

  arXiv:1807.07967",,,,"cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Syntactic search relies on keywords contained in a query to find suitable
documents. So, documents that do not contain the keywords but contain
information related to the query are not retrieved. Spreading activation is an
algorithm for finding latent information in a query by exploiting relations
between nodes in an associative network or semantic network. However, the
classical spreading activation algorithm uses all relations of a node in the
network that will add unsuitable information into the query. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for semantic text search, called
query-oriented-constrained spreading activation that only uses relations
relating to the content of the query to find really related information.
Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that, in terms of the MAP measure, our
search engine is 18.9% and 43.8% respectively better than the syntactic search
and the search using the classical constrained spreading activation.

noncommutativity of coordinates and noncommutativity of momenta are considered
in general case when coordinates and momenta of different particles satisfy
noncommutative algebra with different parameters of noncommutativity. Influence
of noncommutativity on the motion of three-body Sun-Earth-Moon system is
examined. We show that because of noncommutativity the free fall accelerations
of the Moon and the Earth toward the Sun in the case when the Moon and the
Earth are at the same distance to the source of gravity are not the same even
if gravitational and inertial masses of the bodies are equal. Therefore, the
Eotvos-parameter is not equal to zero and the weak equivalence principle is
violated in noncommutative phase space. We estimate the corrections to the
Eotvos-parameter caused by noncommutativity on the basis of Lunar laser ranging
experiment results. We obtain that with high precision the ratio of parameter
of momentum noncommutativity to mass is the same for different particles.

spray to easily introduce pseudo-random scatterers on the surface of a
traditional reflector antenna (TRA). The CRA performs a pseudo random coding of
the incident wavefront, thus adding spatial diversity in the imaging region and
enabling the effective use of compressive sensing (CS) and imaging techniques.
The CRA is fed with a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar, which
consists of four transmitting and four receiving ports. Consequently, the
mechanical scanning parts and phase shifters, which are necessary in
conventional physical or synthetic aperture arrays, are not needed in this
system. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the prototype to perform
a successful 3D reconstruction of a T-shaped metallic target.

possible to parallelize sequential computation by building a model of
whole-program execution, using that model to predict future computations, and
then speculatively executing those future computations. Although that prior
work demonstrated scaling, it did not demonstrate speedup, because it ran
entirely in emulation. We took this as a challenge to construct a hardware
prototype that embodies the ideas of ASC, but works on a broader range of
programs and runs natively on hardware. The resulting system is similar in
spirit to the original work, but differs in practically every respect.
  We present an implementation of the ASC architecture that runs natively on
x86 hardware and achieves near-linear speedup up to 44-cores (the size of our
test platform) for several classes of programs, such as computational kernels,
map-style programs, and matrix operations. We observe that programs are either
completely predictable, achieving near-perfect predictive accuracy, or totally
unpredictable, and therefore not amenable to scaling via ASC-like techniques.
We also find that in most cases, speedup is limited only by implementation
details: the overhead of our dependency tracking infrastructure and the
manipulation of large state spaces. We are able to automatically parallelize
programs with linked data structures that are not amenable to other forms of
automatic parallelization.
