magnetization profile in the vicinity of an interface between magnets with
dissimilar properties. Boundary twists in the vicinity of an edge due to
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions have been first discussed in [Wilson et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 88, 214420 (2013)] and in [Rohart and Thiaville, Phys. Rev. B 88,
184422 (2013)]. We show that in general case the boundary conditions lead to
the magnetization profile corresponding to the N\'eel, Bloch, or intermediate
twist. We explore how such twists can be utilized for creation of skyrmions and
antiskyrmions, e.g., in a view of magnetic memory applications. To this end, we
study various scenarios how skyrmions and antiskyrmions can be created from
interface magnetization twists due to local instabilities. We also show that a
judicious choice of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya tensor (hence a carefully designed
material) can lead to local instabilities generating certain types of skyrmions
or antiskyrmions. The local instabilities are shown to appear in solutions of
the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations describing ellipticity of magnon modes bound
to interfaces. In one considered scenario, a skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair can be
created due to instabilities at an interface between materials with properly
engineered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We use micromagnetics
simulations to confirm our analytical predictions.

result, estimating the amount of resources that need to be preloaded during a
surfer's browsing becomes an important task. In this regard, prefetching can be
modeled as a two-player combinatorial game [Fomin et al., Theoretical Computer
Science 2014], where a surfer and a marker alternately play on a given graph
(representing the Web graph). During its turn, the marker chooses a set of $k$
nodes to mark (prefetch), whereas the surfer, represented as a token resting on
graph nodes, moves to a neighboring node (Web resource). The surfer's objective
is to reach an unmarked node before all nodes become marked and the marker
wins. Intuitively, since the surfer is step-by-step traversing a subset of
nodes in the Web graph, a satisfactory prefetching procedure would load in
cache all resources lying in the neighborhood of this growing subset.
  Motivated by the above, we consider the following problem to which we refer
to as the Maximum Rooted Connected Expansion (MRCE) problem. Given a graph $G$
and a root node $v_0$, we wish to find a subset of vertices $S$ such that $S$
is connected, $S$ contains $v_0$ and the ratio $|N[S]|/|S|$ is maximized, where
$N[S]$ denotes the closed neighborhood of $S$, that is, $N[S]$ contains all
nodes in $S$ and all nodes with at least one neighbor in $S$.
  We prove that the problem is NP-hard even when the input graph $G$ is
restricted to be a split graph. On the positive side, we demonstrate a
polynomial time approximation scheme for split graphs. Furthermore, we present
a $\frac{1}{6}(1-\frac{1}{e})$-approximation algorithm for general graphs based
on techniques for the Budgeted Connected Domination problem [Khuller et al.,
SODA 2014]. Finally, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for the special
case of interval graphs.

these partitions in an online manner. This enables ITs to not only identify
regions of high posterior mass, but also maintain uncertainty estimates to
track regions where significant posterior mass may have been missed. ITs can be
based on any inference method that provides a consistent estimate of the
marginal likelihood. They are particularly effective when combined with
sequential Monte Carlo, where they capture long-range dependencies and yield
improvements beyond proposal adaptation alone.

the observed dark matter abundance. Interestingly, we find that the ALP decay
constant can be much smaller than the ordinary case in which the ALP is

rolling down a convex potential with $M_{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Pl}}}

approaching a flat inflection point, ultra-slow roll is always stable and a
large number of $e$-folds may be realised in this regime. However, in
ultra-slow roll, $\dot{\phi}$ is not a unique function of $\phi$ as it is in

introduces transformations whose input and output are transformations, thus
generalizing the notion of channels and quantum operations. The generalization
then goes recursively, with the construction of a full hierarchy of maps of
increasingly higher order. The analysis of special cases already showed that
higher-order quantum functions exhibit features that cannot be tracked down to
the usual circuits, such as indefinite causal structures, providing provable
advantages over circuital maps. The present treatment provides a general
framework where this kind of analysis can be carried out in full generality.
The hierarchy of higher-order quantum maps is introduced axiomatically with a
formulation based on the language of types of transformations. Complete
positivity of higher-order maps is derived from the general admissibility
conditions instead of being postulated as in previous approaches. The recursive
characterization of convex sets of maps of a given type is used to prove
equivalence relations between different types. The axioms of the framework do
not refer to the specific mathematical structure of quantum theory, and can
therefore be exported in the context of any operational probabilistic theory.

accelerated and irregular heart rate (HR), leading to both heart failure and
stroke and being responsible for an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. In spite of its importance, the direct effects of AF on the arterial
hemodynamic patterns are not completely known to date. Based on a multiscale
modelling approach, the proposed work investigates the effects of AF on the
local arterial fluid dynamics. AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) conditions are
simulated extracting 2000 $\mathrm{RR}$ heartbeats and comparing the most
relevant cardiac and vascular parameters at the same HR (75 bpm). Present
outcomes evidence that the arterial system is not able to completely absorb the
AF-induced variability, which can be even amplified towards the peripheral
circulation. AF is also able to locally alter the wave dynamics, by modifying
the interplay between forward and backward signals. The sole heart rhythm
variation (i.e., from NSR to AF) promotes an alteration of the regular dynamics
at the arterial level which, in terms of pressure and peripheral perfusion,
suggests a modification of the physiological phenomena ruled by periodicity
(e.g., regular organ perfusion)and a possible vascular dysfunction due to the
prolonged exposure to irregular and extreme values. The present study
represents a first modeling approach to characterize the variability of
arterial hemodynamics in presence of AF, which surely deserves further clinical
investigation.

paper, we present the infrared-to-visual (IR2VI) algorithm, a novel
unsupervised thermal-to-visible image translation framework based on generative
adversarial networks (GANs). IR2VI is able to learn the intrinsic
characteristics from VI images and integrate them into IR images. Since the
existing unsupervised GAN-based image translation approaches face several
challenges, such as incorrect mapping and lack of fine details, we propose a
structure connection module and a region-of-interest (ROI) focal loss method to
address the current limitations. Experimental results show the superiority of
the IR2VI algorithm over baseline methods.

bringing improving the inter-domain routing ecosystem through SDN deployment.
Yet, the naive deployment of SDN on the Internet raises concerns about the
correctness of the inter-domain data-plane. By allowing operators to deflect
traffic from the default BGP route, SDN policies are susceptible of creating
permanent forwarding loops invisible to the control-plane.
  In this paper, we propose a system, called Prelude, for detecting SDN-induced
forwarding loops between SDXes with high accuracy without leaking the private
routing information of network operators. To achieve this, we leverage Secure
Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) techniques to build a novel and general
privacy-preserving primitive that detects whether any subset of SDN rules might
affect the same portion of traffic without learning anything about those rules.
We then leverage that primitive as the main building block of a distributed
system tailored to detect forwarding loops among any set of SDXes. We leverage
the particular nature of SDXes to further improve the efficiency of our SMPC
solution.
  The number of valid SDN rules, i.e., not creating loops, rejected by our
solution is 100x lower than previous privacy-preserving solutions, and also
provides better privacy guarantees. Furthermore, our solution naturally
provides network operators with some hindsight on the cost of the deflected
paths.

economically unfeasible for single-mode addressing and also extremely
challenging for processing correlation events with hardware. Here we present a
general and large-scale measurement approach of Correlation on Spatially-mapped
Photon-Level Image (COSPLI). The quantum correlations in other spaces are
mapped into the position space and are captured by single-photon-sensitive
imaging system. Synthetic methods are developed to suppress noises so that
single-photon registrations can be faithfully identified in images. We
eventually succeed in retrieving all the correlations with big-data technique
from tens of millions of images. We demonstrate our COSPLI by measuring the
joint spectrum of parametric down-conversion photons. Our approach provides an

understanding energy transport across the solar atmosphere. The chromosphere is
optically thick at many wavelengths and described by non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE), making it difficult to interpret observations. Furthermore,
there is considerable evidence that the atmosphere is filamented, and that
current instruments do not sufficiently resolve small scale features. In
flares, it is likely that multithreaded models are required to describe the
heating. The combination of NLTE effects and multithreaded modeling requires
computationally demanding calculations, which has motivated the development of
a model that can efficiently treat both. We describe the implementation of a
solver in a hydrodynamic code for the hydrogen level populations that
approximates the NLTE solutions. We derive an accurate electron density across
the atmosphere, that includes the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for
helium and metals. We show the effects on hydrodynamic simulations, which are
used to synthesize light curves using a post-processing radiative transfer
code. We demonstrate the utility of this model on IRIS observations of a small
flare. We show that the Doppler shifts in Mg II, C II, and O I can be explained
with a multithreaded model of loops subjected to electron beam heating, so long
as NLTE effects are treated. The intensities, however, do not match observed
values very well, which is due to assumptions about the initial atmosphere. We
briefly show how altering the initial atmosphere can drastically alter line
profiles, and therefore derived quantities, and suggest that it should be tuned
to pre-flare observations.

curvature and a pseudo-magnetic field. Semiclassical trajectories offer then an
additional insight into the balance of forces acting on the electrons and
provide a convenient tool for predicting the behavior of the current flow

show that the superfluid response --- the difference between responses to
longitudinal and transverse forces --- is zero for coherently driven
polaritons. This is a consequence of the gapped excitation spectrum caused by
external phase locking. Furthermore, while a normal component exists at finite
pump momentum, the remainder forms a rigid state that is unresponsive to either
longitudinal or transverse perturbations. Interestingly, the total response
almost vanishes when the real part of the excitation spectrum has a linear
dispersion, which was the regime investigated experimentally. This suggests
that the observed suppression of scattering should be interpreted as a sign of

five globular clusters orbiting in a dense background of dark matter.
Observational analyses suggest that globular clusters were initially much more
massive and lost most of their stars to the Fornax field. We re-investigate the
Fornax cusp-core problem, to clarify tensions between simulations and
observations concerning the dark matter halo density profile. N-body
simulations predict a centrally steep power-law density profile, while
observations of the globular clusters seem to prefer that the dark matter halo
density is constant at the center. For the first time, we ran pure N-body
simulations with entirely live systems, i.e. self-gravitating systems composed
of particles (including stars and dark matter). Only this numerical approach
accounts correctly for dynamical friction and tidal effects between Fornax and
the globular clusters. We show that a weak cusp ($r_{s}=$ 1.5 kpc) or a large
core ($r_{c}=$ 848 pc) are not compatible with the current observed positions
and masses of Fornax clusters. In contrast, a small dark matter core ($r_{c}=$
282 pc) for Fornax naturally reproduces the cluster spatial and mass
distributions over a wide range of initial globular cluster masses. We derive
an upper limit of $r_{c}\lesssim$ 282 pc. This core size range favors only warm
dark datter (WDM). It is also possible to obtain a compatible core size range
from cold dark matter (CDM) theories, if the initial halo's central cusp is
heated by gas to form a small core.

fermion flavors, which has an $SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry. The infrared behavior
of this theory is not firmly established. We explore candidate infrared phases
by embedding adjoint QCD into $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
deformed by a supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M that preserves all global
symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. This includes 't Hooft anomalies that are
only visible when the theory is placed on manifolds that do not admit a spin
structure. The consistency of this procedure is guaranteed by a nonabelian
spin-charge relation involving the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry that is familiar from
topologically twisted $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. Since every vacuum on the
Coulomb branch of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory necessarily matches all 't Hooft
anomalies, we can generate candidate phases for adjoint QCD by deforming the
theories in these vacua while preserving all symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies.
One such deformation is the supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M itself, which
can be reliably analyzed when M is small. In this regime it gives rise to an
exotic Coulomb phase without chiral symmetry breaking. By contrast, the theory
near the monopole and dyon points can be deformed to realize a candidate phase
with monopole-induced confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The low-energy
theory consists of two copies of a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model, which we
analyze in detail. Certain topological couplings that are likely to be present
in this $\mathbb{CP}^1$ model turn the confining solitonic string of the model
into a topological insulator. We also examine the behavior of various candidate
phases under fermion mass deformations. We speculate on the possible large-M
behavior of the deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory and conjecture that the
$\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase eventually becomes dominant.

where the dependent type $B$, (and therefore the resulting construct) is a
linear type. These can be seen as internalizing universal and existential
quantification of linear predicates. We also consider two modalities, $M$ and
$L$, transforming linear types into cartesian types and vice versa. The theory
is interpreted in a split comprehension category
$\pi:\mathcal{T}\to\mathcal{C}^\to$ accompanied by a split symmetric monoidal
fibration, $\pi: \mathcal{L}\to\mathcal{C}$. This structure determines, for any

category of cartesian types and the monoidal category of linear types over

the Diagram model, which extends the groupoid model of dependent type theory to
accommodate linear types. Here, cartesian types are interpreted as a family of
groupoids, while linear types are interpreted as diagrams
$A:\Gamma\to\mathcal{V}$ in any symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{V}$. We

analogue of the univalence axiom, and provide some discussion on the
higher-dimensional nature of linear dependent types.

originating from scanner hardware, signal processing or induced by the patient
may reduce the image quality and complicate the diagnosis or any image

approaches are not applicable. Model observers mimicking the human observers

period of approximately 300 days which may be decreasing further. It may belong
to a class of Mira variables with a sudden change in period as observed in some
Galactic objects. It would be the first example of an OH/IR star in this class
and deserves further follow-up observations.

1990 to 2008 is undertaken. It is shown that the evolution of V with
heliocentric distance r depends substantially on both the heliolatitude and the
solar activity cycle. Deviations from the predicted Parker's profile of V(r)
are so considerable that cannot be explained by a scarcity of measurements or
other technical effects. In particular, the expected smooth growth of the solar
wind speed with r is typical only for the solar activity maximum and for low
heliolatitudes (lower than +/-40deg), while at high latitudes, there are two
V(r) branches: growing and falling. In the solar activity maximum, V increases
toward the solar pole in the North hemisphere only; however, in the South
hemisphere, it decreases with heliolatitude. In the minimum of solar activity,
the profile of V(r) at low heliolatitudes has a local minimum between 2 and 5
AU. This result is confirmed by the corresponding data from other spacecraft
(Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10). Unexpected spatial variations in V at low
heliolatitudes can be explained by the impact of coronal hole flows on the V(r)
profile since the flows incline to the ecliptic plane. To reproduce the impact
of spatial variations of V in the polar corona on the behavior of V at low
heliolatitudes, a stationary one-fluid ideal MHD-model is developed with
account of recent results on imagery of the solar wind speed in the corona up
to 5.5 solar radii obtained on the basis of combined observations from
SOHO/UVCS, LASCO, and Mauna Loa.

Examples include theories of magnetogenesis, inflation on a steep potential,
chiral gravitational waves, and chromonatural inflation. Such theories require
a mismatch between the axion field range and the mass scale appearing in the $a
F \widetilde{F}$ coupling. This mismatch suggests an underlying monodromy, with
the axion winding around its fundamental period a large number of times. We
investigate the extent to which this integer can be explained as a product of
smaller integers in a UV completion: in the parlance of our times, can the
theory be ""clockworked""? We argue that a clockwork construction producing a
potential $\mu^4 \cos(\frac{a}{j F_a})$ for an axion of fundamental period
$F_a$ will obey the constraint $\mu < F_a$. For some applications, including
chromonatural inflation with sub-Planckian field range, this constraint
obstructs a clockwork UV completion. Alternative routes to a large coupling
include fields of large charge (an approach limited by strong coupling) or
kinetic mixing (requiring a lighter axion). Our results suggest that
completions of axion cosmologies that explain the large parameter in the theory
potentially alter the phenomenological predictions of the model.

the subregion-subregion mapping to be local for both subregions and for states

an upper bound of this quantity, a bound which is saturated when the

formation and evolution within the large scale environment are precisely
understood. Therefore studies with simulated galaxy clusters have flourished.
However detailed comparisons between simulated and observed clusters and their
population - the galaxies - are complicated by the diversity of clusters and
their surrounding environment. An original way initiated by Bertschinger as
early as 1987, to legitimize the one-to-one comparison exercise down to the
details, is to produce simulations constrained to resemble the cluster under
study within its large scale environment. Subsequently several methods have
emerged to produce simulations that look like the local Universe. This paper
highlights one of these methods and its essential steps to get simulations that
not only resemble the local Large Scale Structure but also that host the local
clusters. It includes a new modeling of the radial peculiar velocity
uncertainties to remove the observed correlation between the decreases of the
simulated cluster masses and of the amount of data used as constraints with the
distance from us. This method has the particularity to use solely radial
peculiar velocities as constraints: no additional density constraints are
required to get local cluster simulacra. The new resulting simulations host
dark matter halos that match the most prominent local clusters such as Coma.
Zoom-in simulations of the latter and of a volume larger than the 30 Mpc/h
radius inner sphere become now possible to study local clusters and their
effects. Mapping the local Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and Sachs-Wolfe effects can
follow.

measure the azimuthally averaged kinematics of the inner stellar halo between
1.5 kpc and 20 kpc from the Galactic centre. We find that their kinematics are
strongly radially anisotropic, and their velocity ellipsoid nearly spherically
aligned over this volume. Only in the inner regions $\lesssim$ 5 kpc does the
anisotropy significantly fall (but still with $\beta >$ 0.25) and the velocity
ellipsoid tilt towards cylindrical alignment. In the inner regions, our sample
of halo stars rotates at up to 50 km s$^{-1}$, which may reflect the early
history of the Milky Way, although there is also significant angular momentum
exchange with the Galactic bar at these radii. We subsequently apply the Jeans
equations to these kinematic measurements in order to non-parametrically infer
the azimuthally averaged gravitational acceleration field over this volume, and
by removing the contribution from baryonic matter, measure the contribution
from dark matter. We find that the gravitational potential of the dark matter
is nearly spherical with average flattening $q_\Phi=$ 1.01 $\pm$ 0.06 between 5
kpc and 20 kpc, and by fitting parametric ellipsoidal density profiles to the
acceleration field, we measure the flattening of the dark matter halo over
these radii to be $q_\rho=$ 1.00 $\pm$ 0.09.

deformations of a single 5d SCFT are described by different gauge theories, or
equivalently that the SCFT points in parameter space of two gauge theories
coincide. The pairs of dual theories that we study are realized by brane webs
in type IIB string theory that are S-dual to each other. We focus on $SU(2)$
SQCD theories with $N_f \le 4$ flavors, which are self-dual, and on $SU(3)$
SQCD theories, which are dual to $SU(2)^2$ quiver theories. From string theory
engineering we predict that Wilson loops are mapped to dual Wilson loops under
S-duality. We confirm the predictions with exact computations of Wilson loop
VEVs, which we extract from the 5d half-index in the presence of auxiliary loop
operators (also known as higher qq-characters) sourced by D3 branes placed in
the brane webs. A special role is played by Wilson loops in tensor products of
the (anti)fundamental representation, which provide a natural basis to express
the S-duality action. The exact computations also reveal the presence of
additional multiplicative factors in the duality map, in the form of background
Wilson loops.

the neutrino mass spectrum. It has been recently shown that, by insisting in
the absence of these vacua, as suggested by {\it Weak Gravity Conjecture} (WGC)
arguments, intriguing constraints on the value of the lightest neutrino mass
and the 4D cosmological constant are obtained. For fixed Yukawa coupling one
also obtains an upper bound on the EW scale $\left\langle
H\right\rangle\lesssim {\Lambda_4^{1/4}} /{Y_{\nu_{i}}}$,where $\Lambda_4$ is
the 4D cosmological constant and $Y_{\nu_{i}}$ the Yukawa coupling of the
lightest (Dirac) neutrino. This bound may lead to a reassessment of the gauge
hierarchy problem. In this letter, following the same line of arguments, we
point out that the SM without a Higgs field would give rise to new AdS lower
dimensional vacua. Absence of latter would require the very existence of the SM
Higgs. Furthermore one can derive a lower bound on the Higgs vev $\left\langle
H\right\rangle\gtrsim \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ which is required by the absence of
AdS vacua in lower dimensions. The lowest number of quark/lepton generations in
which this need for a Higgs applies is three, giving a justification for family
replication. We also reassess the connection between the EW scale, neutrino
masses and the c.c. in this approach. The EW fine-tuning is here related to the
proximity between the c.c. scale $\Lambda_4^{1/4}$ and the lightest neutrino
mass $m_{\nu_i}$ by the expression $ \frac {\Delta H}{H} \lesssim \frac

simply by observing them act. Such representations help agents quickly learn to
predict the effects of their own actions on the environment and to plan complex
action sequences. In this work, we address the problem of learning an agent's
action space purely from visual observation. We use stochastic video prediction
to learn a latent variable that captures the scene's dynamics while being
minimally sensitive to the scene's static content. We introduce a loss term
that encourages the network to capture the composability of visual sequences
and show that it leads to representations that disentangle the structure of
actions. We call the full model with composable action representations
Composable Learned Action Space Predictor (CLASP). We show the applicability of
our method to synthetic settings and its potential to capture action spaces in
complex, realistic visual settings. When used in a semi-supervised setting, our
learned representations perform comparably to existing fully supervised methods
on tasks such as action-conditioned video prediction and planning in the
learned action space, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer action labels.

exchangeable random partitions of the numbers $\{1,\dots,n\}$. This process is
related to the Ewens sampling model in Genetics and to Bayesian nonparametric
methods such as topic models. In this paper, we study the GCRP in a regime
where the number of parts grows like $n^\alpha$ with $\alpha>0$. We prove a
non-asymptotic concentration result for the number of parts of size
$k=o(n^{\alpha/(2\alpha+4)}/(\log n)^{1/(2+\alpha)})$. In particular, we show
that these random variables concentrate around $c_{k}\,V_*\,n^\alpha$ where
$V_*\,n^\alpha$ is the asymptotic number of parts and $c_k\approx
k^{-(1+\alpha)}$ is a positive value depending on $k$. We also obtain
finite-$n$ bounds for the total number of parts. Our theorems complement
asymptotic statements by Pitman and more recent results on large and moderate

combinations of hydrogen level/state in the sample and of pressure transmitting

pressure resulted in the dissolution of d hydrides and that interstitial
hydrogen retards the formation of w Zr. A pressure of around 9 GPa was required
to halve the hydride fraction. These results imply that the effect of pressure
is thermodynamically analogous to that of increasing temperature, but that the
effect is small. The results are consistent with the volume per Zr atom of the
a, d and w phases, with the bulk moduli of a and d, and with previous
measurements of the hydrogen site molar volumes in the a and d phases. The

In contrast to solidification processes controlled by a temperature field that

temperature gradient) precipitation/dissolution is controlled by a solute
concentration field that is discontinuous at the solid/liquid interface. The
sharp-interface asymptotic analysis of the phase-field equations for

two distinct features of galaxies, namely the disk and the bulge. This process

on three other galaxies with different morphologies. On the galactic scale we
find that $f(T)$ gravity departs from standard Newtonian theory in an important

how the human brain grows during the early period of life when the rate of
brain growth is at its peak. The development of MRI techniques has enabled the
quantification of brain development. A key quantity that can be extracted from
MRI measurements is the level of myelination, where myelin acts as an insulator
around nerve fibers and its deployment makes nerve pulse propagation more
efficient. The co-variation of myelin deployment across different brain regions
provides insights into the co-development of brain regions and can be assessed
as a correlation matrix that varies with age. Typically, available data for
each child are very sparse, due to the cost and logistic difficulties of
arranging MRI brain scans for infants. We showcase here a method where data per
subject are limited to measurements taken at only one random age, while aiming
at the time-varying dynamics. This situation is encountered more generally in
cross-sectional studies where one observes $p$-dimensional vectors at one
random time point per subject and is interested in the $p \times p$ correlation
matrix function over the time domain. The challenge is that at each observation
time one observes only a $p$-vector of measurements but not a covariance or
correlation matrix. For such very sparse data, we develop a Fr\'echet
estimation method. Given a metric on the space of covariance matrices, the
proposed method generates a matrix function where at each time the matrix is a
non-negative definite covariance matrix, for which we demonstrate consistency
properties. We discuss how this approach can be applied to myelin data in the
developing brain and what insights can be gained.

onset, a gradual rise in the emission with time as t^0.8, a peak at about 150
days post-merger, followed by a relatively rapid decline. To date, various
models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a
choked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However,
the observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817
launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long
Baseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817
exhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger.
This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that,
while the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow
(cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and
narrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of <5 degrees, and observed from
a viewing angle of about 20 degrees. The imaging of a collimated relativistic
outflow emerging from GW170817 adds substantial weight to the growing evidence
linking binary neutron star mergers and short gamma-ray bursts.

contains a mixture of ultra-red and blue objects. In contrast, Jovian and
Neptunian Trojans are observed to be blue. While the absence of ultra-red
Jovian Trojans can be readily explained by the sublimation of volatile material
from their surfaces due to the high flux of solar radiation at 5AU, the lack of
ultra-red Neptunian Trojans presents both a puzzle and a challenge to formation
models. In this work we report the discovery by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of
two new dynamically stable L4 Neptunian Trojans,2013 VX30 and 2014 UU240, both
with inclinations i >30 degrees, making them the highest-inclination known
stable Neptunian Trojans. We have measured the colors of these and three other
dynamically stable Neptunian Trojans previously observed by DES, and find that
2013 VX30 is ultra-red, the first such Neptunian Trojan in its class. As such,
2013 VX30 may be a ""missing link"" between the Trojan and TNO populations. Using
a simulation of the DES TNO detection efficiency, we find that there are 162
+/- 73 Trojans with Hr < 10 at the L4 Lagrange point of Neptune. Moreover, the
blue-to-red Neptunian Trojan population ratio should be higher than 17:1. Based
on this result, we discuss the possible origin of the ultra-red Neptunian
Trojan population and its implications for the formation history of Neptunian
Trojans.

this model generically creates either stable stripes, or a never-settling

minimal model which displays the same instability as the full model, and

school or undergraduate laboratory. The key components are a laser pointer to
actuate the material, a force sensor from an inexpensive jeweler's balance to
measure the response, an Arduino for data acquisition and a means for
mechanically mounting the components. The apparatus described here was used by
high school students and teachers in a summer program to characterize liquid
crystal elastomers. The theory of the photomechanical response is used to
interpret the data, from which the material parameters are determined.

circum-stellar medium (CSM) of the stellar progenitor. Cosmic rays (CRs) if
accelerated at these shocks can induce the growth of electromagnetic
fluctuations in the foreshock medium. In this study, using a self-similar
description of the shock evolution, we calculate the growth timescales of
CR-driven instabilities. We select a sample of nearby core collapse radio
supernova of type II and Ib/Ic. From radio data we infer the parameters which
enter in the calculation of the instability growth times. We find that extended
IIb SNe shocks can trigger fast intra day instabilities, strong magnetic field
amplification and CR acceleration. In particular, the non-resonant streaming
instability can contribute to about 50\% of the magnetic field intensity
deduced from radio data. This results in the acceleration of CRs in the range
1-10 PeV within a few days after the shock breakout. In order to produce strong
magnetic field amplification and CR acceleration a fast shocks pervading a
dense CSM is necessary. In that aspect IIn supernov\ae~are also good
candidates. But a detailed modeling of the blast wave dynamics coupled with
particle acceleration is mandatory for this class of object before providing
any firm conclusions. Finally, we find that the trans-relativistic object SN
2009bb even if it produces more modest magnetic field amplification can
accelerate CRs up to 2-3 PeV within 20 days after the outburst.

atmospheric transmission due to precipitable water vapor (PWV) at user
specified sites. Using the package, ground-based photometric observations taken
between $3,000$ and $12,000$ $\AA$ can be corrected for atmospheric effects due
to PWV. Atmospheric transmission in the optical and near-infrared is highly
dependent on the PWV column density along the line of sight. By measuring the
delay of dual-band GPS signals through the atmosphere, the SuomiNet project
provides accurate PWV measurements for hundreds of locations around the world.
The pwv_kpno package uses published SuomiNet data in conjunction with MODTRAN
models to determine the modeled, time-dependent atmospheric transmission. A
dual-band GPS system was installed at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in
the spring of 2015. Using measurements from this receiver we demonstrate that
we can successfully predict the PWV at KPNO from nearby dual-band GPS stations
on the surrounding desert floor. The pwv_kpno package can thus provide
atmospheric transmission functions for observations taken before the KPNO
receiver was installed. Using PWV measurements from the desert floor, we
correctly model PWV absorption features present in spectra taken at KPNO. We
also demonstrate how to configure the package for use at other observatories.

under the purview of the proposed, provable meta-algorithm, ""Mimic and
Classify"", which is realized in two-steps: (a) Mimic the CI distribution close
enough to recover the support, and (b) Classify to distinguish the joint and
the CI distribution. Thus, as long as we have a good generative model and a
good classifier, we potentially have a sound CI Tester. With this modular
paradigm, CI Testing becomes amiable to be handled by state-of-the-art, both
generative and classification methods from the modern advances in Deep
Learning, which in general can handle issues related to curse of dimensionality
and operation in small sample regime. We show intensive numerical experiments
on synthetic and real datasets where new mimic methods such conditional GANs,
Regression with Neural Nets, outperform the current best CI Testing performance
in the literature. Our theoretical results provide analysis on the estimation
of null distribution as well as allow for general measures, i.e., when either
some of the random variables are discrete and some are continuous or when one

types with unknown proportions, how do we estimate the probability of
discovering a new type at the $(n+1)$-th draw? This is a classical problem in
statistics, commonly referred to as the missing mass estimation problem. Recent
results by Ohannessian and Dahleh \citet{Oha12} and Mossel and Ohannessian
\citet{Mos15} showed: i) the impossibility of estimating (learning) the missing
mass without imposing further structural assumptions on the type proportions;
ii) the consistency of the Good-Turing estimator for the missing mass under the
assumption that the tail of the type proportions decays to zero as a regularly
varying function with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1)$. In this paper we rely on
tools from Bayesian nonparametrics to provide an alternative, and simpler,
proof of the impossibility of a distribution-free estimation of the missing
mass. Up to our knowledge, the use of Bayesian ideas to study large sample
asymptotics for the missing mass is new, and it could be of independent
interest. Still relying on Bayesian nonparametric tools, we then show that
under regularly varying type proportions the convergence rate of the
Good-Turing estimator is the best rate that any estimator can achieve, up to a
slowly varying function, and that minimax rate must be at least
$n^{-\alpha/2}$. We conclude with a discussion of our results, and by
conjecturing that the Good-Turing estimator is an rate optimal minimax
estimator under regularly varying type proportions.

limitations including the stochastic nature of the STT-switching and a high
critical switching current, which makes it unsuitable for ultrafast operation
at nanosecond and sub-nanosecond regimes. Spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching,
which relies on the torque generated by an in-plane current, has the potential
to overcome these limitations. However, SOT-MRAM cells studied so far use a
three-terminal structure in order to apply the in-plane current, which
increases the size of the cells. Here we report a two-terminal SOT-MRAM cell
based on a CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junction pillar on an ultrathin and narrow

time evolution of wavevector-dependent quantities allows for the spectroscopic
reconstruction of the flat bands. Our results pave the way for future
experiments with Rydberg quantum simulators, which can extend our linear
spin-wave study to the fully nonlinear regime, characterized by the appearance

principle, a central theme upon which we construct multiple universal
optimization heuristics for training both parametrized quantum circuits and
classical deep neural networks on a quantum computer. Baqprop encodes error
information in relative phases of a quantum wavefunction defined over the space
of network parameters; it can be thought of as the unification of the phase
kickback principle of quantum computation and of the backpropagation algorithm
from classical deep learning. We propose two core heuristics which leverage
Baqprop for quantum-enhanced optimization of network parameters: Quantum
Dynamical Descent (QDD) and Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent (MoMGrad).
QDD uses simulated quantum coherent dynamics for parameter optimization,
allowing for quantum tunneling through the hypothesis space landscape. MoMGrad
leverages Baqprop to estimate gradients and thereby perform gradient descent on
the parameter landscape; it can be thought of as the quantum-classical analogue
of QDD. In addition to these core optimization strategies, we propose various
methods for parallelization, regularization, and meta-learning as augmentations
to MoMGrad and QDD. We introduce several quantum-coherent adaptations of
canonical classical feedforward neural networks, and study how Baqprop can be
used to optimize such networks. We develop multiple applications of parametric
circuit learning for quantum data, and show how to perform Baqprop in each
case. One such application allows for the training of hybrid quantum-classical
neural-circuit networks, via the seamless integration of Baqprop with classical
backpropagation. Finally, for a representative subset of these proposed
applications, we demonstrate the training of these networks via numerical
simulations of implementations of QDD and MoMGrad.

production continues to contaminate sixteen sites around the United States.
Although many challenges and obstacles exist in decontaminating these sites,
two particularly difficult tasks associated with cleanup of this waste are
extracting and separating actinide elements from the remainder of the solution,
containing other actinide elements and non actinide elements. Developing
effective methods for performing these separations is possible by designing new
chelating agents that form stable complexes with actinide elements, and by
investigating the interactions between the chelating agents and the actinide
elements. In this work, new chelating agents (or ligands) with potential to
facilitate the separation of radioactive waste are designed for Th, Pa, and U
using relativistic Density Functional Theory (DFT) inconjunction with a
high-throughput algorithm. We show that both methodologies can be combined
efficiently to accelerate discovery and design of new ligands for separation of
the radioactive actinides. The main hypothesis that we test with this approach
is that the strength of secondary coordination sphere (SCS) can be tuned to
increase the selectivity of binding with different actinides. More
specifically, we show that links that connect two of the catecholamide ligands
via covalent interactions are then added to increase the overall stability of
the complex. The effect of increase in the selectivity is also observed when
non-covalent interaction is used between ligands. We apply this approach for
Th, Pa, and U, and discover linkers that can be used with other ligands.

Swagger specification describes how to access a cloud service through its REST
API (e.g., what requests the service can handle and what responses may be
expected).
  This paper introduces REST-ler, the first automatic intelligent REST API
security-testing tool. REST-ler analyzes a Swagger specification and generates
tests that exercise the corresponding cloud service through its REST API. Each
test is defined as a sequence of requests and responses. REST-ler generates
tests intelligently by (1) inferring dependencies among request types declared
in the Swagger specification (e.g., inferring that ""a request B should not be
executed before a request A"" because B takes as an input argument a resource-id
x returned by A) and by (2) analyzing dynamic feedback from responses observed
during prior test executions in order to generate new tests (e.g., learning
that ""a request C after a request sequence A;B is refused by the service"" and
therefore avoiding this combination in the future). We show that these two
techniques are necessary to thoroughly exercise a service under test while
pruning the large search space of possible request sequences. We also discuss

Galactic supernova remnant (SNR). It has non-thermal emission, an optical
emission line spectrum displaying shock excitation and standard SNR line
ratios, fine filamentary structures in HAlpha typical of optical remnants and
closely overlapping radio and optical footprints. An X-ray ROSAT source 1RXS
J175752.1-231105 was also found that matches the radio and optical emission
though a definite association is not proven. Nevertheless, taken together, all
these observed properties point to a clear SNR identification for this source.
We provide a rough estimate for the kinematic distance to G6.31+0.54 of
~4.5kpc. The detected optical filaments are some ~10arcminutes in extent (or
about 13 pc at the assumed distance). However, as only a partial arcuate
structure of the SNR can be seen (and not a full shell) the full angular extent
of the SNR is unclear. Hence the physical extent of the observed partial shell
is also difficult to estimate. If we assume an approximately circular shell
then a conservative fit to the optical arc shaped filaments gives an angular
diameter of ~20 arcminutes corresponding to a physical diameter of ~26 pc that
shows this to be an evolved remnant.

the debris disk is in steady state, this result is consistent with the dust
production rates predicted by Kenyon & Bromley (2008) from theoretical models
of icy planet formation. We find a dust luminosity of $(7.9 \pm 0.8) \times

porosity, with $\sim 1$ lunar mass in grains with radius 1 $\mu$m -- 1 mm. If

explain the far-IR, submm, and mm emission. If the grains are composed of

strategies to reduce the impact forces in a human-robot collaboration
environment. A proposed strategy is using a compliant flooring for an
environment because it can reduce the stiffness of the ground. In this study,
we proposed that if a rigid layer is mounted on a compliant flooring
(double-layer flooring), the impact force is further reduced. In order to
investigate this goal, we designed two subjective laboratory experiments. In
experiment 1, the subjects were instructed falling to the ground where was
covered by a single layer of compliant material (a foam pad). In experiment 2,
the subjects fell on double-layer flooring when one rigid layer (a wood
surface) was mounted on the compliant layer. The impact forces were measured
for two short forward fall heights onto the outstretched hand. The results
showed that the profile of the impact forces consists of two peaks. The first
peak has a higher magnitude, and it is followed by the second peak with a lower
magnitude. Comparing the magnitude of the first peak between two experiments
shows a reduction of the impact force in experiment 2. In contrast, the
magnitudes of second peaks are identical for both experiments. Therefore, we
concluded that using a double-layer flooring, i.e.one rigid layer and one
compliant layer can be an effective strategy for considerably reducing the
impact force, and preventing the wrist fractures during the forward fall.

samples, multiplied by a fast-decaying window and perturbed by an additive
noise, over an interval which is potentially larger than the essential support
of the window. A core theoretical question is to provide bounds on the possible
amount of extrapolation, depending on the sample perturbation level and the
function prior. In this paper we consider soft extrapolation of entire
functions of finite order and type (containing the class of bandlimited
functions as a special case), multiplied by a super-exponentially decaying
window (such as a Gaussian). We consider a weighted least-squares polynomial
approximation with judiciously chosen number of terms and a number of samples
which scales linearly with the degree of approximation. It is shown that this
simple procedure provides stable recovery with an extrapolation factor which
scales logarithmically with the perturbation level and is inversely
proportional to the characteristic lengthscale of the function. The pointwise
extrapolation error exhibits a H\""{o}lder-type continuity with an exponent
derived from weighted potential theory, which changes from 1 near the available
samples, to 0 when the extrapolation distance reaches the characteristic
smoothness length scale of the function. The algorithm is asymptotically
minimax, in the sense that there is essentially no better algorithm yielding
meaningfully lower error over the same smoothness class. When viewed in the
dual domain, the above problem corresponds to (stable) simultaneous
de-convolution and super-resolution for objects of small space/time extent. Our
results then show that the amount of achievable super-resolution is inversely
proportional to the object size, and therefore can be significant for small
objects.

in contexts where one may adopt multilevel (ML) Monte Carlo. The underlying
problem is to approximate expectations w.r.t. an underlying probability measure
that is associated to a continuum problem, such as a continuous-time stochastic
process. It is then assumed that the associated probability measure can only be
used (e.g. sampled) under a discretized approximation. In such scenarios, it is
known that to achieve a target error, the computational effort can be reduced
when using MLMC relative to exact sampling from the most accurate discretized
probability. The ideas rely upon introducing hierarchies of the discretizations
where less accurate approximations cost less to compute, and using an
appropriate collapsing sum expression for the target expectation. If a suitable
coupling of the probability measures in the hierarchy is achieved, then a
reduction in cost is possible. This article focused on the case where exact
sampling from such coupling is not possible. We show that one can construct
suitably coupled MCMC kernels when given only access to MCMC kernels which are
invariant with respect to each discretized probability measure. We prove, under
assumptions, that this coupled MCMC approach in a ML context can reduce the
cost to achieve a given error, relative to exact sampling. Our approach is
illustrated on a numerical example.

Android static analysis tools to discover, document, and fix, flaws, by
leveraging the well-founded practice of mutation analysis. We implement $\mu$SE
as a semi-automated framework, and apply it to a set of prominent Android
static analysis tools that detect private data leaks in apps. As the result of
an in-depth analysis of one of the major tools, we discover 13 undocumented
flaws. More importantly, we discover that all 13 flaws propagate to tools that
inherit the flawed tool. We successfully fix one of the flaws in cooperation
with the tool developers. Our results motivate the urgent need for systematic
discovery and documentation of unsound choices in soundy tools, and demonstrate
the opportunities in leveraging mutation testing in achieving this goal.

respectively. Since the baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF) and Faber-Jackson (BFJ)
relations are observed facts, this relation implies that $G\, a = {\rm
constant}$. This result cannot be obtained in Newtonian dynamics which cannot
explain the origin of the BTF and BFJ relations. An alternative, modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) assumes that $G=G_0$ is constant in space and derives
naturally a characteristic constant acceleration $a=a_0$, as well as the BTF
and BFJ relations. This is overkill and it comes with a penalty: MOND cannot
explain the origin of $a_0$. A solid physical resolution of this issue is that
$G \propto a^{-1}$, which implies that in lower-acceleration environments the
gravitational force is boosted relative to its Newtonian value because $G$
increases. This eliminates all problems related to MOND's empirical cutoff
$a_0$ and yields a quantitative method for mapping the detailed variations of
$G(a)$ across each individual galaxy as well as on larger and smaller scales.
On the opposite end, the large accelerations produced by $G(a)$ appear to be
linked to the weak-field limit of the fourth-order theory of conformal Weyl

neutron star (NS) is governed by the Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation, which is a
second-order differential equation but degrades to first-order on the light
surface (LS). The key to numerically solving the GS equation is to enable
magnetic field lines smoothly cross the LS, and crossing a straight LS in flat
spacetime has been a well-studied problem. But the numerical algorithm
implementation becomes complicate in the presence of a bent LS, e.g. in curved
spacetime, since there is no suitable computation grid adapted to it. We
propose to circumvent this grid-LS mismatch problem by introducing a new
coordinate frame designed such that the LS in it is a straight line. As an
application, we investigate the general relativistic (GR) effect in
magnetosphere structure of rapidly rotating pulsars in detail, where the LS is
bent towards the central NS. We split the GR effect into two parts, curvature
and frame-dragging; measure each of them and examine their dependence on the NS
mass and the angular velocity for pulsars embedded in aligned dipole and
multipole magnetic fields. Qualitatively speaking, we find that the curvature
effect compactifies the magnetic field lines near the NS, therefore reduces the
open magnetic flux and the Poynting luminosity, while the frame-dragging effect
contributes a minor part in shaping the magnetosphere structure but plays a
role in enhancing the spacelike current generation.

especially a problem for high-dimensional targets when the standard random-walk

quasi-Newton (qN) methods can be employed to form proposals which utilize
gradient information to guide the Markov chain to areas of high probability and
to construct approximations of the local curvature to scale step sizes. The

the luminosity distance, which enables us to probe cosmology. In this paper, we
continue to expand the application of GW standard sirens in cosmology, and
propose that the spatial curvature can be estimated in a model-independent way
by comparing the distances from future GW sources and current
cosmic-chronometer observations. We expect an electromagnetic counterpart of
the GW event to give the source redshift, and simulate hundreds of GW data from
the coalescence of double neutron stars and black hole--neutron star binaries
using the Einstein Telescope as reference. Our simulations show that, from 100
simulated GW events and 31 current cosmic-chronometer measurements, the error
of the curvature parameter $\Omega_{K}$ is expected to be constrained at the
level of $\sim0.125$. If 1000 GW events are observed, the uncertainty of
$\Omega_{K}$ would be further reduced to $\sim0.040$. We also find that adding
50 mock $H(z)$ data (consisting of 81 cosmic-chronometer data and 1000
simulated GW events) could result in much tighter constraint on the zero cosmic
curvature, for which, $\Omega_{K}=-0.002\pm0.028$. Compared to some actual
model-independent curvature tests involving the distances from other cosmic
probes, this method with GW data achieves constraints with much higher
precision.

applied to regularize large models to avoid overfitting, and the improvement in
performance by dropout has been explained as avoiding co-adaptation between
nodes. However, when correlations between nodes are compared after training the
networks with or without dropout, one question arises if co-adaptation
avoidance explains the dropout effect completely. In this paper, we propose an
additional explanation of why dropout works and propose a new technique to
design better activation functions. First, we show that dropout can be
explained as an optimization technique to push the input towards the saturation
area of nonlinear activation function by accelerating gradient information
flowing even in the saturation area in backpropagation. Based on this
explanation, we propose a new technique for activation functions, {\em gradient
acceleration in activation function (GAAF)}, that accelerates gradients to flow
even in the saturation area. Then, input to the activation function can climb
onto the saturation area which makes the network more robust because the model
converges on a flat region. Experiment results support our explanation of
dropout and confirm that the proposed GAAF technique improves image
classification performance with expected properties.

the tasks are complex for a single controller to learn. Behaviour-decomposition
techniques have been used to divide a task into multiple subtasks and evolve
separate subcontrollers for each subtask. However, these subcontrollers and the

are used to construct them. However, such software metrics are often correlated
to defect models. Prior work often uses feature selection techniques to remove
correlated metrics in order to improve the performance of defect models. Yet,
the interpretation of defect models may be misleading if feature selection
techniques produce subsets of inconsistent and correlated metrics. In this
paper, we investigate the consistency and correlation of the subsets of metrics
that are produced by nine commonly-used feature selection techniques. Through a
case study of 13 publicly-available defect datasets, we find that feature
selection techniques produce inconsistent subsets of metrics and do not
mitigate correlated metrics, suggesting that feature selection techniques
should not be used and correlation analyses must be applied when the goal is
model interpretation. Since correlation analyses often involve manual selection
of metrics by a domain expert, we introduce AutoSpearman, an automated metric
selection approach based on correlation analyses. Our evaluation indicates that
AutoSpearman yields the highest consistency of subsets of metrics among
training samples and mitigates correlated metrics, while impacting model
performance by 1-2%pts. Thus, to automatically mitigate correlated metrics when
interpreting defect models, we recommend future studies use AutoSpearman in
lieu of commonly-used feature selection techniques.

variants of MIRL are considered: uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, and
uNE-MIRL, each distinguished by its solution concept. Problem uCS-MIRL is a
cooperative game in which the agents employ cooperative strategies that aim to
maximize the total game value. In problem uCE-MIRL, agents are assumed to
follow strategies that constitute a correlated equilibrium while maximizing
total game value. Problem uNE-MIRL is similar to uCE-MIRL in total game value
maximization, but it is assumed that the agents are playing a Nash equilibrium.
Problems advE-MIRL and cooE-MIRL assume agents are playing an adversarial
equilibrium and a coordination equilibrium, respectively. We propose novel
approaches to address these five problems under the assumption that the game
observer either knows or is able to accurate estimate the policies and solution
concepts for players. For uCS-MIRL, we first develop a characteristic set of
solutions ensuring that the observed bi-policy is a uCS and then apply a
Bayesian inverse learning method. For uCE-MIRL, we develop a linear programming
problem subject to constraints that define necessary and sufficient conditions
for the observed policies to be correlated equilibria. The objective is to
choose a solution that not only minimizes the total game value difference
between the observed bi-policy and a local uCS, but also maximizes the scale of
the solution. We apply a similar treatment to the problem of uNE-MIRL. The
remaining two problems can be solved efficiently by taking advantage of
solution uniqueness and setting up a convex optimization problem. Results are
validated on various benchmark grid-world games.

the paper, we carry out the rigorous mathematical analysis of the compressible
Navier-Stokes approximation for the Boltzmann equation regarding the
initial-boundary value problems in general bounded domains. The main goal is to
measure the uniform-in-time deviation of the Boltzmann solution with diffusive
reflection boundary condition from a local Maxwellian with its fluid quantities
given by the solutions to the corresponding compressible Navier-Stokes
equations with consistent non-slip boundary conditions whenever $\epsilon>0$ is
small enough. Specifically, it is shown that for well chosen initial data
around constant equilibrium states, the deviation weighted by a velocity
function is $O(\epsilon^{1/2})$ in $L^\infty_{x,v}$ and $O(\epsilon^{3/2})$ in
$L^2_{x,v}$ globally in time. The proof is based on the uniform estimates for
the remainder in different functional spaces without any spatial regularity.
One key step is to obtain the global-in-time existence as well as
uniform-in-$\epsilon$ estimates for regular solutions to the full compressible
Navier-Stokes equations in bounded domains when the parameter $\epsilon>0$ is

Euler equations with moving physical vacuum boundary condition. The physical
vacuum singularity requires the sound speed to be scaled as the square root of
the distance to the vacuum boundary. The main difficulty lies in the fact that
the system of hyperbolic conservation laws becomes characteristic and
degenerate at the vacuum boundary. Our proof is based on an approximation of
the Euler equations by a degenerate parabolic regularization obtained from a
specific choice of a degenerate artificial viscosity term. Then we construct
the solutions to this degenerate parabolic problem and establish the estimates
that are uniform with respect to the artificial viscosity parameter. Solutions
to the compressible Euler equations are obtained as the limit of the vanishing

question of paramount societal and technological importance: ""can we seamlessly
and systematically influence routing decisions in pedestrian crowds?""
Establishing effective crowd steering methods is extremely relevant in the
context of crowd management, e.g. when it comes to keeping floor usage within
safety limits (e.g. during public events with high attendance) or at designated
comfort levels (e.g. in leisure areas). In the Moving Light setup, visitors
walking in a corridor face a choice between two symmetric exits defined by a
large central obstacle. Stimuli, such as arrows, alternate at random and
perturb the symmetry of the environment to bias choices. While visitors move in
the experiment, they are tracked with high space and time resolution, such that
the efficiency of each stimulus at steering individual routing decisions can be
accurately evaluated a posteriori. In this contribution, we first describe the
measurement concept in the Moving Light experiment and then we investigate
quantitatively the steering capability of arrow indications.

of an article and produce a single number for scientific assessment of
scholars. Although this concept is very simple to compute, it fails to show the
scientific productivity and impact of scholars during a time-span or in a year.
To overcome this, several time series indicators have been proposed that
consider the citations from the entire research career of a scholar. However,
these indicators fail to give a comparative assessment of two scholars having
same or very similar index value. To overcome this shortcoming, h-index
sequence was proposed to assess the impact of scholars during a particular
time-span and to compare multiple scholars at a similar stage in their careers.
The h-index sequence is based on the h-index formulation. One of the main
issues related to the h-index is that it completely ignores the excess citation
in scientific assessment; h-index sequence also exhibits a similar behaviour.
To overcome these limitations, in this article, we have discussed the EM and
$EM^{'}$-index sequence, and performed an empirical study based on yearly
citation count earned from all publications of 89 scholars' publication data.
The element of the EM and $EM^{'}$-index sequence for a given year shows the
impact of a scholar for that year. We conclude that the EM and $EM^{'}$-index

analysis (PCA) has been widely considered as an efficient and effective
preprocessing step for hyperspectral image (HSI) processing and analysis tasks.
It takes each band as a whole and globally extracts the most representative
bands. However, different homogeneous regions correspond to different objects,
whose spectral features are diverse. It is obviously inappropriate to carry out
dimensionality reduction through a unified projection for an entire HSI. In
this paper, a simple but very effective superpixelwise PCA approach, called
SuperPCA, is proposed to learn the intrinsic low-dimensional features of HSIs.
In contrast to classical PCA models, SuperPCA has four main properties. (1)
Unlike the traditional PCA method based on a whole image, SuperPCA takes into
account the diversity in different homogeneous regions, that is, different
regions should have different projections. (2) Most of the conventional feature
extraction models cannot directly use the spatial information of HSIs, while
SuperPCA is able to incorporate the spatial context information into the
unsupervised dimensionality reduction by superpixel segmentation. (3) Since the
regions obtained by superpixel segmentation have homogeneity, SuperPCA can
extract potential low-dimensional features even under noise. (4) Although
SuperPCA is an unsupervised method, it can achieve competitive performance when
compared with supervised approaches. The resulting features are discriminative,
compact, and noise resistant, leading to improved HSI classification
performance. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the SuperPCA
model significantly outperforms the conventional PCA based dimensionality
reduction baselines for HSI classification. The Matlab source code is available

parts. Here we propose and analyse a specific light transfer solution for
Kalpana One type settlements. Our proposed solution is technically reliable
because it avoids large moving parts that could be single failure points. The
scheme has an array of cylindrical paraboloid concentrators in the outer wall
and semi-toroidal reflectors at the equator which distribute the concentrated
sunlight onto the living surface. The living cylinder is divided into a number
of $\varphi$-sections (valleys) that are in different phases of the diurnal and
seasonal cycles. To reduce the mass of nitrogen needed, a shallow atmosphere is
used which is contained by a pressure-tight transparent roof. The only moving
parts needed are local blinders installed below the roof of each valley. We
also find that settlements of this class have a natural location at the equator
where one can build multi-storey urban blocks. The location is optimal from the
mass distribution (rotational stability) point of view. If maximally built, the
amount of urban floorspace per person becomes large, up to 25,000 m$^2$, which
is an order of magnitude larger than the food-producing rural biosphere area
per person. Large urban floorspace area per person may increase the material
standard of living much beyond Earth while increasing the total mass per person
relatively little.

vacancy (NV) centers in diamond - a paramagnetic point defect whose spin can be
optically polarized at room temperature - has attracted widespread attention,
but applications have been hampered by the need to align the NV axis with the
external magnetic field. Here we overcome this hurdle through the combined use
of continuous optical illumination and a microwave sweep over a broad frequency

diamond where we attain bulk 13C spin polarization in excess of 0.25 percent
under ambient conditions. Remarkably, our technique acts efficiently on diamond
crystals of all orientations, and polarizes nuclear spins with a sign that
depends exclusively on the direction of the microwave sweep. Our work paves the
way towards the use of hyperpolarized diamond particles as imaging contrast
agents for biosensing and, ultimately, for the hyperpolarization of nuclear
spins in arbitrary liquids brought in contact with their surface.

simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is adopted in the
downlink. Two scenarios with space division multiple access (SDMA) and time
division multiple access (TDMA) in the uplink are considered. For both the

Funke, August Johansson, Stephan Schmidt","Shape Optimization using the Finite Element Method on Multiple Meshes",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important step in shape optimization with partial differential equation
constraints is to adapt the geometry during each optimization iteration. Common
strategies are to employ mesh-deformation or re-meshing, where one or the other
typically lacks robustness or is computationally expensive. This paper proposes
a different approach, in which the computational domain is represented by
multiple, independent meshes. A Nitsche based finite element method is used to
weakly enforce continuity over the non-matching mesh interfaces. The
optimization is preformed using an iterative gradient method, in which the
shape-sensitivities are obtained by employing the Hadamard formulas and the
adjoint approach. An optimize-then-discretize approach is chosen due to its
independence of the FEM framework. Since the individual meshes may be moved
freely, re-meshing or mesh deformations can be entirely avoided in cases where
the geometry changes consists of rigid motions or scaling. By this free
movement, we obtain robust and computational cheap mesh adaptation for
optimization problems even for large domain changes. For general geometry
changes, the method can be combined with mesh-deformation or re-meshing
techniques to reduce the amount of deformation required. We demonstrate the
capabilities of the method on several examples, including the optimal placement
of heat emitting wires in a cable to minimize the chance of overheating, the
drag minimization in Stokes flow, and the orientation of 25 objects in a Stokes
flow.

within a distance of 11 Mpc. Their majority have precise distances, estimates
of hydrogen mass fraction and star-formation rate derived from far-ultraviolet
or Halpha fluxes. To describe an environment, we attribute two dimensionless
values: the density contrast created by the most significant neighbour and the
local density contrast produced by all neighbours within a separation of 1 Mpc.
The hydrogen mass fraction exhibits a weak effect of HI deficiency being the
most pronounced for dwarf irregular galaxies. The specific star-formation rate
(sSFR) is more sensitive to the environment than the hydrogen mass fraction.
Almost all (99 per cent) LV galaxies have their sSFR below -9.4 dex (1/yr). We
notice that irregular dwarfs as well as late-type bulgeless galaxies are
capable to reproduce their stellar mass with the observed sSFR over the cosmic
time. Thus, the transformation of gas into stars in dIrs and spiral disks is
rather sluggish unlike that in E, S0, dSph galaxies, whose star-formation
history has been stormy and short. Scatter of SFR(Halpha)-to-SFR(FUV) ratio
increases from Sc, Sd, Sm galaxies towards BCD, Im, Ir types that favours the
idea of bursty star formations in low-mass galaxies. However, this bursty
activity is caused rather by internal processes than by an external tidal
action. A fraction of quenched E, S0, dSph galaxies increases from ~5 per cent
in the field up to ~50 per cent in the densest regions.

superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium cavities, leading to
unprecedented accelerating fields of 49 MV/m in TESLA-shaped cavities, in
continuous wave (CW); the corresponding peak magnetic fields are the highest
ever measured in CW, about 210 mT. For TESLA-shape cavities the maximum quench
field ever achieved was ~45 MV/m - reached very rarely- with most typical
values being below 40 MV/m. These values are reached for niobium surfaces
treated with electropolishing followed by the so called mild bake, a 120C
vacuum bake (for 48 hours for fine grain and 24 hours for large grain
surfaces). We discover that the addition during the mild bake of a step at 75C
for few hours, before the 120C, increases systematically the quench fields up
to unprecedented values of 49 MV/m. The significance of the result lays not
only in the relative improvement, but in the proof that niobium surfaces can
sustain and exceed CW radio frequency magnetic fields much larger than Hc1,
pointing to an extrinsic nature of the current field limitations, and therefore
to the potential to reach accelerating fields well beyond the current state of

temperature (a few hundred kelvin). How cooling evolves in less active comets
has not been studied before. Aims. We aim to investigate how electron cooling
varied as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko changed its activity by three orders
of magnitude during the Rosetta mission. We used in situ data from the Rosetta
plasma and neutral gas sensors. By combining Langmuir probe bias voltage sweeps
and mutual impedance probe measurements, we determined at which time cold
electrons formed at least 25\% of the total electron density. We compared the
results to what is expected from simple models of electron cooling, using the
observed neutral gas density as input. We demonstrate that the slope of the
Langmuir probe sweep can be used as a proxy for the presence of cold electrons.
We show statistics of cold electron observations over the two-year mission
period. We find cold electrons at lower activity than expected by a simple
model based on free radial expansion and continuous loss of electron energy.
Cold electrons are seen mainly when the gas density indicates that an exobase
may have formed. Collisional cooling of electrons following a radial outward
path is not sufficient to explain the observations. We suggest that the
ambipolar electric field keeps electrons in the inner coma for a much longer
time, giving them time to dissipate energy by collisions with the neutrals. We
conclude that better models are required to describe the plasma environment of
comets. They need to include at least two populations of electrons and the
ambipolar field.

exploiting wireless spatial resources of uplink channels occupied by assigned

scheme, RA UEs are able to exploit the spatial resources that are approximately
orthogonal to those of assigned UEs, thus sharing the uplink channel resource
with assigned UEs without causing significant interference to them.
Specifically, to ensure RA UEs avoid serious interference with assigned UEs,
base station (BS) sends tailored virtual carriers to RA UEs on behalf of
assigned UEs. RA UEs then conduct VCS to determine whether or not the uplink
channel resource is available for RA. Closed-form approximations for

spreading (a.k.a gossip or token dissemination) in adversarial dynamic
networks, where the goal is to spread $k$ tokens of information to every node
on an $n$-node network. We consider the amortized (average) message complexity
of spreading a token, assuming that the number of tokens is large. Our focus is
on token-forwarding algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any way other
than storing, copying, and forwarding them.
  We consider two types of adversaries that arbitrarily rewire the network
while keeping it connected: the adaptive adversary that is aware of the status
of all the nodes and the algorithm (including the current random choices), and
the oblivious adversary that is oblivious to the random choices made by the
algorithm. The central question that motivates our work is whether one can
achieve subquadratic amortized message complexity for information spreading.
  We present two sets of results depending on how nodes send messages to their
neighbors: (1) Local broadcast: We show a tight lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ on
the number of amortized local broadcasts, which is matched by the naive
flooding algorithm, (2) Unicast: We study the message complexity as a function
of the number of dynamic changes in the network. To facilitate this, we
introduce a natural complexity measure for analyzing dynamic networks called
adversary-competitive message complexity where the adversary pays a unit cost
for every topological change. Under this model, it is shown that if $k$ is
sufficiently large, we can obtain an optimal amortized message complexity of
$O(n)$. We also present a randomized algorithm that achieves subquadratic
amortized message complexity when the number of tokens is not large under an
oblivious adversary.

changes the frequencies but also the brightness of the source, the latter of
which is called the `beaming effect'. Here we investigate such an effect for
GWs and find that the observed amplitude of a GW signal, unlike the behavior of
light, is not a monotonic function of the relative velocity and responds
differently to the two GW polarizations. We attribute the difference to a
rotation of the wave-vector, as well as a reorientation of the GW
polarizations. We find that even for velocities as small as $0.25\%$ of the
speed of light, ignoring the aforementioned beaming effect could induce a
systematic error that is larger than the designated calibration accuracy of
LIGO. This error could lead to an incorrect estimation of the distance and
orbital inclination of a GW source, or result in a spurious signal that appears

requires expertise, while current computer-aided methods focus on the
segmentation of the entire aorta, are unable to concurrently segment true-false
lumen, and some require human interaction. We here report a fully automated
approach based on a 3-D multi-task deep convolutional neural network that
segments the entire aorta and true-false lumen from CTA images in a unified

preoperative and 44 postoperative) obtained using various systems from 254
unique patients with type B aortic dissection. Slice-wise manual segmentation
of the entire aorta and the true-false lumen for each 3-D CTA image was
provided. Upon evaluation of another 16 CTA images (11 preoperative and 5
postoperative) with ground truth segmentation provided by experienced vascular
surgeons, our method achieves a mean dice similarity score(DSC) of 0.910,0.849
and 0.821 for the entire aorta,true lumen and false lumen respectively.

distributed burning in lean methane and hydrogen flames. Dilatation across the
flame means that extremely large Karlovitz numbers are required; even at the
extreme levels of turbulence studied (up to a Karlovitz number of 8767)
distributed burning was only achieved in the hydrogen case. In this case,
turbulence was found to broaden the reaction zone visually by around an order
of magnitude, and thermodiffusive effects (typically present for lean hydrogen
flames) were not observed. In the preheat zone, the species compositions differ
considerably from those of one-dimensional flames based a number of different
transport models (mixture-averaged, unity Lewis number, and a turbulent eddy
viscosity model). The behaviour is a characteristic of turbulence dominating
non-unity Lewis number species transport, and the distinct limit is again
attributed to dilatation and its effect on the turbulence. Peak local reaction
rates are found to be lower in the distributed case than in the lower Karlovitz
cases but higher than in the laminar flame, which is attributed to effects that
arise from the modified fuel-temperature distribution that results from
turbulent mixing dominating low Lewis number thermodiffusive effects. Finally,
approaches to achieve distributed burning at realisable conditions are
discussed; factors that increase the likelihood of realising distributed
burning are higher pressure, lower equivalence ratio, higher Lewis number, and
lower reactant temperature.

invariance under redundant encodings of the two-torus shape in the path

of the spacetime geometry implies (i) that 2d CFTs are both modular and

the inaccuracy of the adiabatic approximation we have developed a leading-order
local- equivalent continuum-discretized coupled-channel model that accounts for
non-adiabatic effects in the presence of nonlocality of nucleon optical
potentials. We have applied our model to the astro- physically relevant

associated with the lowest and the highest n-p kinetic energy in the

a significant reduction of the sensitivity to the high n-p momenta thus
confirming that it is mostly associated with theoretical uncertainties of the

Dirac-Maxwell correspondence. We start by exploring vacuum where the reciprocal
momentum space of both Maxwell's equations and the massless Dirac equation
(Weyl equation) possess a magnetic monopole. The critical distinction is the
nature of magnetic monopole charges, which are integer valued for photons but
half-integer for electrons. This inherent difference is directly tied to the
spin and ultimately connects to the bosonic or fermionic behavior. We also show
the presence of photonic Dirac strings, which are line singularities in the
underlying Berry gauge potential. While the results in vacuum are intuitively
expected, our central result is the application of this topological
Dirac-Maxwell correspondence to 2D photonic (bosonic) materials, as opposed to
conventional electronic (fermionic) materials. Intriguingly, within dispersive
matter, the presence of photonic Dirac monopoles is captured by nonlocal
quantum Hall conductivity - i.e. a spatiotemporally dispersive gyroelectric
constant. For both 2D photonic and electronic media, the nontrivial topological
phases emerge in the context of massive particles with broken time-reversal
symmetry. However, the bulk dynamics of these bosonic and fermionic Chern
insulators are characterized by spin-1 and spin-1/2 skyrmions in momentum
space, which have fundamentally different interpretations. This is exemplified
by their contrasting spin-1 and spin-1/2 helically quantized edge states. Our

susceptibility measurements on single crystalline C$_6$(CH$_3$)$_6$ in the
cases where the applied magnetic field is parallel and perpendicular to the
molecular basal planes. In the former case, metastable behavior near the onset
temperature T$_{C-H}$=118 K is identified while in the latter, no anomalous
behavior is observed. Similar anomalies are observed in deuterated
hexamethylbenzene C$_6$(CD$_3$)$_6$ (where D is deuterium), however, T$_{C-D}$
occurs 14 K higher at 132 K. In addition, a peak anomaly identified near 42 K
is suggested to be due to the onset of coherent quantum tunneling of deuterons.
The near cubic ground state is proposed to be the result of a more radical form
of the Jahn-Teller effect occurring in a molecular solid where the lattice
distorts to remove the orbital degeneracies of the protons to lower its energy.
The apparent magnetic anisotropy and isotope effect provide evidence that apart
from electrons, not only protons, but also deuterons establish strongly

on the mean area of a passive self-propagating front and, hence, on the rate of
fluid consumption by the front is analysed in the case of asymptotically high
turbulent Reynolds number $Re_L$ and asymptotically high ratio of the
Kolmogorov velocity to a constant speed $u_0$ of the front. By considering an
early stage of the front evolution, the mean (over the studied early stage)
front area and consumption velocity $\bar{u}_T$ are analytically determined.
The analysis shows that the mean $\bar{u}_T$ is proportional to the rms
turbulent velocity, which characterizes large-scale turbulent eddies, even if
the instantaneous rate of an increase in the front area is mainly controlled by
the smallest Kolmogorov eddies. A straightforward dependence of the mean area
or $\bar{u}_T$ on the Kolmogorov velocity, length, and time scales vanishes due
to the following physical mechanism. At high $Re_L$, turbulent stretching
created by small-scale eddies increases the front area exponentially with time,
whereas a volume bounded by the leading and trailing edges of the front grows
significantly slower. Therefore, after a short time, the volume is tightly
filled by the front and the mean distance between opposed front elements
becomes small with respect to Kolmogorov length scale. Subsequently, such front
elements collide, thus, reducing the front area and limiting the mean
$\bar{u}_T$.

hybrid units with a single accelerating gap called Hybrid Photo Diodes (HPD).
Scintillating light was transmitted to the HPDs by means of optical fibers.
During data taking at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the signal strength of
scintillator tiles of detector units in the forward region degraded
significantly due to the damage related to the amount of radiation to which the
scintillator was exposed to. Scintillators suffer damage when exposed to
radiation, however, the amount of damage observed was more than originally
estimated. Several HPDs were removed during a detector shut down period.
Microscopic scans of relative quantum efficiencies for few of these HPDs were
made. The damage of the photocathode was determined to vary with the amount of
optical signal transmitted by optical fibers to the HPD. Imprints of each fiber

observed. Most of the observed reduction of the calorimeter signal can be

function and its ability to recover activation paths through the layers.
Papyan, Romano, and Elad conducted an analysis of such an architecture,
demonstrated the relationship with DCNNs and proved conditions under which the
D-CSC is guaranteed to recover specific activation paths. A technical
innovation of their work highlights that one can view the efficacy of the ReLU
nonlinear activation function of a DCNN through a new variant of the tensor's
sparsity, referred to as stripe-sparsity. Using this they proved that
representations with an activation density proportional to the ambient
dimension of the data are recoverable. We extend their uniform guarantees to a
modified model and prove that with high probability the true activation is
typically possible to recover for a greater density of activations per layer.
Our extension follows from incorporating the prior work on one step

significance of links against null hypotheses of random interaction. Yet, it is
well known that the growth of most real-world networks is highly non-random, as
past interactions between nodes typically increase the likelihood of further

We design such family of null hypotheses by adapting the P\'olya urn, a simple
one-parameter combinatorial model driven by a self-reinforcement mechanism, to
a network setting. We provide a full analytical description of our filter, and
show that it retains or discards links based on a non-trivial interplay between
their own local importance and the importance of the nodes they belong to. We
prove that the widely used disparity filter can be recovered as a
large-strength approximation for a specific value of the P\'olya filter's
parameter, and illustrate our findings by applying the filter to two large

literature, it is assumed that each file can be delivered to different users at
different rates, which may correspond to different quality representations of
the underlying content, e.g., scalable coded video segments. Accordingly,
instead of a single achievable rate, the system performance is characterized by
a rate tuple, which corresponds to the vector of rates users' requests can be

achievable rate regions are characterized, and compared with a novel outer

typically not investigated. Our investigation shows that the balance of false

numerical approximation, a very promising alternative based on the Koopman
operator has recently emerged. In this chapter, we present two control
strategies for model predictive control of nonlinear PDEs using data-efficient
approximations of the Koopman operator. In the first one, the dynamic control
system is replaced by a small number of autonomous systems with different yet
constant inputs. The control problem is consequently transformed into a
switching problem. In the second approach, a bilinear surrogate model, is
obtained via linear interpolation between two of these autonomous systems.
Using a recent convergence result for Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(EDMD), convergence to the true optimum can be proved. We study the properties
of these two strategies with respect to solution quality, data requirements,

have exploded in popularity in recent years and are increasingly applicable to
biology due to the rise in available data. We attempt to link protein design
and deep learning by using variational autoencoders to generate protein
sequences conditioned on desired properties. Potential copper and calcium
binding sites are added to non-metal binding proteins without human
intervention and compared to a hidden Markov model. In another use case, a
grammar of protein structures is developed and used to produce sequences for a
novel protein topology. One candidate structure is found to be stable by
molecular dynamics simulation. The ability of our model to confine the vast
search space of protein sequences and to scale easily has the potential to
assist in a variety of protein design tasks.

Symbolic models, which train and generate at the note level, are currently the

melodic structure, but fail to grasp the nuances and richness of raw audio
generations. Raw audio models, such as DeepMind's WaveNet, train directly on
sampled audio waveforms, allowing them to produce realistic-sounding, albeit
unstructured music. In this paper, we propose an automatic music generation
methodology combining both of these approaches to create structured,
realistic-sounding compositions. We consider a Long Short Term Memory network
to learn the melodic structure of different styles of music, and then use the
unique symbolic generations from this model as a conditioning input to a
WaveNet-based raw audio generator, creating a model for automatic, novel music.
We then evaluate this approach by showcasing results of this work.

many medical image analysis tasks. Although image registration is a rather
general concept specialized methods are usually required to target a specific
registration problem. The development and implementation of such methods has
been tough so far as the gradient of the objective has to be computed. Also,
its evaluation has to be performed preferably on a GPU for larger images and
for more complex transformation models and regularization terms. This hinders
researchers from rapid prototyping and poses hurdles to reproduce research
results. There is a clear need for an environment which hides this complexity
to put the modeling and the experimental exploration of registration methods
into the foreground. With the ""Autograd Image Registration Laboratory""

the analytic gradients of the objective function are computed automatically and
the device where the computations are performed, on a CPU or a GPU, is
transparent. It is meant as a laboratory for researchers and developers
enabling them to rapidly try out new ideas for registering images and to
reproduce registration results which have already been published. AIRLab is
implemented in Python using PyTorch as tensor and optimization library and
SimpleITK for basic image IO. Therefore, it profits from recent advances made

mags in the B-band) with three superposed dips with duration 120-180 days. This
demonstrates that there is a continuum of dip durations from a day to a
century, so that the secular fading is seen to be by the same physical
mechanism as the short-duration Kepler dips. The BVRI light curves all have the
same shape, with the slopes and amplitudes for VRI being systematically smaller

We rule out any hypothesis involving occultation of the primary star by any

same as that expected for ordinary extinction by dust clouds. This chromatic
extinction implies dust particle sizes going down to ~0.1 micron, suggesting
that this dust will be rapidly blown away by stellar radiation pressure, so the
dust clouds must have formed within months. The modern infrared observations
were taken at a time when there was at least 12.4% +- 1.3% dust coverage (as
part of the secular dimming), and this is consistent with dimming originating
in circumstellar dust.

discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, we present a particle-mesh scheme which
allows for diffusion-free advection, satisfies mass and momentum conservation
principles in a local sense, and allows the extension to high-order spatial
accuracy. To achieve this, we propose a novel particle-mesh projection operator
required for the exchange of information between the particles and the mesh.
Key is to cast these projections as a PDE-constrained $\ell^2$-optimization
problem to allow the advective field naturally located on Lagrangian particles
to be expressed as a mesh quantity. By expressing the control variable in terms
of single-valued functions at cell interfaces, this optimization problem
seamlessly fits in a HDG framework. Owing to this framework, the resulting
scheme can be implemented efficiently via static condensation. The performance
of the scheme is demonstrated by means of various numerical examples for the
linear advection-diffusion equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations. The results show that optimal spatial accuracy can be achieved, and
given the particular time-stepping strategy, second-order time accuracy is
confirmed. The robustness of the scheme is illustrated by considering
benchmarks for advection of discontinuous fields and the Taylor-Green vortex
instability in the high Reynolds number regime.

by either core-like or mantle-like material. The approximately even spread in
the core mass fraction of the pollutants and the lack of crust-rich pollutants

fragments produced by the collision of larger differentiated bodies. The
compositions of many pollutants exhibit trends related to elemental volatility,
which we link to the temperatures and, thus, the locations at which these
bodies formed. Our analysis found that the abundances observed in 11 of the 17
systems considered are consistent with the compositions of nearby stars in
combination with a trend related to elemental volatility. The even spread and
large range in the predicted formation location of the pollutants suggests that
pollutants arrive in white dwarf atmospheres with a roughly equal efficiency

modeled here as an overlap between two distributions that represent the state

characterize the area of overlap between two Gaussian distributions, and
compare it with the method of Bhattacharyya distance. We provide closed form
expressions that can characterize the overlap as a function of control. Our
proposed algorithm can avoid overlapping uncertainty distributions in two
possible ways. Firstly when a prescribed overlapping area that needs to be
avoided is posed as a confidence contour lower bound, control commands are
accordingly realized through a MPC framework such that these bounds are
respected. Secondly in tight spaces control commands are computed such that the
overlapping distribution respects a prescribed range of overlap characterized
by lower and upper bounds of the confidence contours. We test our proposal with
extensive set of simulations carried out under various constrained

three stages: coupled dictionary learning, coupled sparse denoising, and
$k$-space consistency enforcing. The first stage learns a group of dictionaries
that capture correlations among multiple contrasts. By capitalizing on the
learned adaptive dictionaries, the second stage performs joint sparse coding to
denoise the corrupted target image with the aid of a guidance contrast. The
third stage enforces consistency between the denoised image and the

incorporating additional guidance contrast via our design improves MRI
reconstruction, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

systems since their dynamic effects are usually negligible. However, for
thermofluid systems this assumption does not hold because time-dependency is an

a highly non-additive symmetric mixture at selective walls is discussed. We
have concentrated on the interplay between the surface induced demixing in the
adsorbed films and the properties of the bulk mixture, which exhibits a closed
immiscibility loop. It has been shown that the wetting behaviour depends on the
absolute values of the parameters determining the strengths of interaction
between the mixture components and the surface, as well as on their difference.
In general, an increase of the difference between the adsorption energies of
the components leads to a decrease of the wetting temperature. In the cases
when the wetting of non-selective walls occurs at the temperatures above the
onset of demixing transition in the bulk, an increasing wall selectivity leads
to a gradual decrease of the wetting temperature towards the triple point, in
which the vapour coexists with the mixed and demixed liquid phases. When the
wetting temperature at the non-selective wall is located below the onset of the
demixing transition in the bulk mixture, an increase of the adsorption energy
of the selected component causes the developing adsorbed films to demix and to
show the reentrant mixing upon approaching the bulk coexistence. At the
temperatures above the onset of the demixing transition in the bulk, the
adsorbed films remain demixed up to the bulk coexistence and undergo the
first-order wetting transition. A rather unexpected finding has been the
observation of a gradual increase of the wetting temperature at highly
selective walls.

described and analyzed with the help of Biggins' martingales, parametrized by

is a rather recent topic. Assuming that certain sufficient conditions for the
convergence of the martingales to non-degenerate limits hold, we investigate
the fluctuations of the martingales around their limits. We discover three
different regimes. First, we show that for parameters with small absolute
values, the fluctuations are Gaussian and the limit laws are scale mixtures of
the real or complex standard normal laws. We also cover the boundary of this
phase. Second, we find a region in the parameter space in which the martingale
fluctuations are determined by the extremal positions in the branching random
walk. Finally, there is a critical region (typically on the boundary of the set
of parameters for which the martingales converge to a non-degenerate limit)
where the fluctuations are stable-like and the limit laws are the laws of
randomly stopped L\'evy processes satisfying invariance properties similar to
stability.

modifies the intermolecular structure comprising four carbonate molecules in

coupled oscillators have been examined prominently in the last decades.
Nevertheless, little attention has been paid on the emergence of this
imperative collective phenomenon in networks displaying temporal changes in the
connectivity patterns. However there are numerous practical examples where
interactions are present only at certain points of time owing to physical
proximity. In this work, we concentrate on exploring the emergence of
interlayer and intralayer synchronization states in a multiplex dynamical
network comprising of layers having mobile nodes performing a random walk. We
thoroughly illustrate the impacts of the network parameters, in particular the
vision range $\phi$ and the step size $u$ together with the inter- and
intralayer coupling strengths $\epsilon$ and $k$ on these synchronous states
arising in coupled R\""{o}ssler systems. The presented numerical results are
very well validated by analytically derived necessary conditions for the
emergence and stability of the synchronous states. Furthermore, the robustness
of the states of synchrony is studied under both structural and dynamical
perturbations. We find interesting results on interlayer synchronization for a
continuous removal of the interlayer links as well as for progressively created
static nodes. We demonstrate that the mobility parameters responsible for
intralayer movement of the nodes, can retrieve interlayer synchrony under such
structural perturbations. For further analysis of survivability of interlayer
synchrony against dynamical perturbations, we proceed through the investigation
of single-node basin stability, where again the intralayer mobility properties
have noticeable impacts. We also discuss the scenarios related mainly to
effects of the mobility parameters in terms of percolation of the whole

planning. Task planning is characterized by causal relationships expressed as
conditions and effects of optional actions. Possible actions are typically
represented by templates, where each template can be instantiated into a number
of primitive actions. While most previous work for domain-independent task
planning has focused on primitive actions in a state-oriented view, our
encoding uses a fully lifted representation at the level of action templates.
It follows a time-oriented view in the spirit of previous work in
constraint-based scheduling. As a result, the proposed encoding is simple and
compact as it grows with the number of actions in a solution plan rather than
the number of possible primitive actions. When solved with an SMT solver, we
show that the proposed encoding is slightly more efficient than
state-of-the-art methods on temporally constrained planning benchmarks while
clearly outperforming other fully constraint-based approaches.

nematic phase, defect structures not present in the uniaxial nematic are
observed, which indicates that the new phase has lower symmetry than the
ordinary nematic phase. The phase transition is weakly first order with a
significant pretransitional behavior, which manifests as strong splay
fluctuations. When approaching the phase transition, the splay nematic constant
is unusually low and goes towards zero. Analogously to the transition from the
uniaxial nematic to the twist-bend nematic phase, this transition is driven by
instability towards splay orientational deformation, resulting in a
periodically splayed structure. And, similarly, a Landau-de Gennes type of
phenomenological theory can be used to describe the phase transition. The
modulated splay phase is biaxial and antiferroelectric.

perturbation theory (ChPT) to calculate the equation of state (EOS) of
$\beta$-stable neutron star matter using the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock many-body
approach. We use the recent optimized chiral two-body nuclear interaction at
N2LO derived by \cite{ekstrom1} and two different parametrizations of the
three-body N2LO interaction: the first one is fixed to reproduce the saturation
point of symmetric nuclear matter while the second one is fixed to reproduce
the binding energies of light atomic nuclei. We show that in the second case
the properties of nuclear matter are not well determined whereas in the first
case various empirical nuclear matter properties around the saturation density
are well reproduced. We also calculate the nuclear symmetry energy $E_{sym}$ as
a function of the nucleonic density and compare our results with the empirical
constraints obtained using the excitation energies of isobaric analog states in
nuclei and the experimental data on the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei.
We next calculate various neutron star properties and in particular the
mass-radius and mass-central density relations. We find that the adopted
interactions based on a fully microscopic framework, are able to provide an EOS
which is consistent with the present data of measured neutron star masses and
in particular with the mass $M=2.01\pm0.04 M_\odot$ of the neutron star in PSR

a measure providing the distance of a given matrix to the nearest singular one.
Despite its possible application strength this measure is still far from being
handled in an efficient way also due to findings of Poljak and Rohn providing
proof that checking this property is NP-hard for a general matrix. To handle
this we can either find approximation algorithms or making known bounds for
radius of regularity tighter. Improvements of both have been recently shown by
Hartman and Hladik (doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31769-4\_9) utilizing relaxation to
semidefinite programming. These approaches consider general matrices without or
with just mild assumptions about the original matrix. This work explores a
process of regularity radius analysis and identifies useful properties enabling
easier estimation of the corresponding radius values based on utilization of
properties of special class of considered matrices. At first, checking
finiteness of regularity radius is shown to be a polynomial problem along with
determining a maximal bound on number of nonzero elements of the matrix to
obtain infinite radius. Further, relationship between maximum (Chebyshev) norm
and spectral norm is used to construct new bounds for the radius of regularity.
A new method based on Jansson-Rohn algorithm for testing regularity of an
interval matrix is presented which is not a priory exponential along with
numerical experiments. For a situation where an input matrix has a special
form, several results are provided such as exact formulas for several special
classes of matrices, e.g., for totally positive and inverse non-negative, or
approximation algorithms, e.g., rank-one radius matrices. For tridiagonal
matrices, an algorithm by Bar-On, Codenotti and Leoncini is utilized to design
a polynomial algorithm to compute the regularity radius.

However, within organic optoelectronic devices, it is often the 'dark' spin-1

ignored in treatments of polariton physics. Here we demonstrate polariton
population from the triplet manifold via triplet-triplet annihilation, leading
to polariton emission that is longer-lived (>microseconds) even than exciton
emission in bare films. This enhancement arises from spin-2 triplet-pair
states, formed by singlet fission or triplet-triplet annihilation, feeding the
polariton. This is possible due to state mixing, which -in the strong coupling

non-emissive. Such 'photonic sharing' offers the enticing possibility of
harvesting or manipulating even states that are formally dark.

dependency of the surface tension on the surfactant concentration. Subsequently
a double asymptotic perturbation method is used in terms of small electric
Reynolds number and capillary number in the limit of a diffusion-dominated
surfactant transport mechanism. Also going beyond the widely employed
axisymmetric framework, the coupled system of governing differential equations
in three dimensions are then solved by adopting the `generalized Lamb solution
technique'. The expressions of key variables suggest that the flow curvature of
the external flow, the electric field effects and the surfactant effects are
coupled in a non-trivial manner, well beyond a linear superposition. A careful
investigation shows that surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses interacts with
the electrohydrodynamic stresses in a highly coupled fashion. Owing to this,
under different combinations of electrical conductivity and permittivity
ratios, the Mason number and the applied electric field direction, the
surfactants affect differently on the longitudinal as well as cross-stream
migration velocity of the drop. The present results may be of utmost importance
in providing a deep insight to the underlying complex physical mechanisms. Most
importantly the ability of surfactants in selectively controlling the drop
motion in different directions, makes them suitable for achieving a new degree
of freedom in the electrical actuation of droplets in the microfluidic devices.

covariates is larger than the number of observations and the interest is in
estimating the conditional variance of the response variable given the
covariates. A conditional and unconditioned framework are considered, where
conditioning is with respect to the covariates, which are ancillary to the

in the unconditional framework when the marginal distribution of the covariates
is normal with known mean and variance. In the present work, a certain Bayesian
hypothesis test is formulated under the conditional framework, and it is shown
that the Bayes risk is a constant. This implies that no consistent estimator
exists in the conditional framework. However, when the marginal distribution of
the covariates is normal, the conditional error of the above consistent
estimator converges to zero, with probability converging to one. It follows
that even in the conditional setting, information about the marginal
distribution of an ancillary statistic may have a significant impact on
statistical inference. The practical implication in the context of
high-dimensional regression models is that additional observations, where only
the covariates are given, are potentially very useful and should not be
ignored. This finding is most relevant to semi-supervised learning problems

psychometric models, the utility of the testlet model relies heavily on
accurate estimation of its model parameters. The two-parameter logistic (2PL)
testlet model has only been systematically investigated in the psychometric

estimation methods, namely Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, although
there are other estimation methods available such as marginal maximum

  In the current study, a comprehensive simulation study was conducted to
investigate how MCMC, MMLE, and one limited information estimation method
(WLSMV), all implemented in Mplus, recovered the item parameters and the
testlet variance parameter of the 2PL testlet model. The manipulated factors
were sample size and testlet effect magnitude, and parameter recovery were
evaluated with bias, standard error, and root mean square error. We found that
there were no statistically significant differences regarding parameter
recovery between the three methods. When both sample size and magnitude of
testlet variance were small, both WLSMV and MCMC had convergence issues, which
did not occur to MCMC regardless of sample size and testlet variance. A real

dynamics (MD) simulations are performed on oil/water and oil/brine systems. The
oil phase is composed of asphaltenes (10 wt%) and o.xylene in which asphaltenes
are entirely soluble. Seven different model-asphaltenes with diverse molecular
weights, architectures, and heteroatom contents are employed. Interestingly, MD
results indicate that asphaltenes become less soluble in oil when water is
partially misciblized in the oil phase. All model-asphaltenes containing
nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms in their structures are prone to association. The
driving force behind asphaltene aggregation is shown to be an asphaltene-water
hydrogen bond. The utilization of the brine (3.5 wt% NaCl) instead of pure
water induces a slight decrease in asphaltene propensity for aggregation due to
salt-in effect. MD results suggest that face-to-face contact is the prominent
stacking of asphaltene molecules in their aggregates.

on this topic which advocate utilizing relays either between PLC links or
between wireless links, the authors of this paper focus on using AF relaying
for in-home PLC and wireless systems where one PLC user wants to share data
with one wireless user which has no access to the PLC network. We refer to this
system as the Hybrid approach. A mathematical method is developed for this
network to formulate the capacity of the system by exploiting the statistical
properties of both PLC and wireless channels. Monte Carlo simulations are used
throughout this paper to validate the analytical results. The impact of several
system parameters is investigated in this paper. For the sake of comparison, we
also provide the performance analysis and results for a PLC only network. The
results showed that the performance of the hybrid system enhances as we
increase the relay gain and deteriorates as the end-to-end distance increases.
It is also found that the PLC only scheme may outperform the hybrid one if the
relay gain is relatively small; however, the user mobility offered by the
hybrid system remains the main advantage over the PLC only system.

flames is presented considering the relative effects of turbulence and LES
filtering, along with a potential modelling approach for LES with finite-rate
chemistry. The leading-order effect was found to be due to the filter
operation; flame response to turbulence was a secondary effect, and manifested
primarily as an increase in standard deviations about conditional means. It was
found that the radicals O, H and OH were less impacted by the filter than other
high-temperature radicals, which were significantly reduced in magnitude by the
filter. By considering reaction path diagrams, key reactions have been
identified that are responsible for disparities between the desired filtered
reaction rates and the reaction rates evaluated using quantities available in
LES calculations (i.e. the filtered species and temperature). More
specifically, the hydrogen abstraction reactions that take CH4 to CH3 (by O, H
and OH) were found to have particularly enhanced reaction rates, and dominate
the reaction path. Under the conditions presented, reaction paths were found to
be independent of turbulence intensity. In general, the filtered reaction rates
from the DNS were found to align more closely with the filtered laminar profile
than the reaction rate of filtered species and temperature, (but disparities
were found to decrease with increasing Karlovitz number). A simple model for
scaling reaction rates is considered based on filtered laminar flame profiles,
and the resulting reaction paths demonstrate proof-of-concept of a simple
approach for formulating a reaction rate model for LES with finite-rate
chemistry.

patient alignment on the image quality by a C-arm flat-panel detector computer
tomography (CACT).
  Materials and Methods: An ACR phantom placed in two opposite directions along
the z-Axis was imaged using a CACT. Image acquisition was performed by three
different image acquisition protocols using fixed X-ray tube voltages of 81,
102 and 125 kVp. The images were reconstructed with four different convolution
kernels, i.e. normal, sharp, soft and very soft. Image quality was assessed in
terms of high contrast image quality using the modulation transfer function
(MTF) and low contrast image quality by assessing the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) as well as reliability of density
measurements. Furthermore, the dose intensity profiles parallel and
perpendicular to the patient support were measured free-in-air.
  Results: The intensity profile of the CACT measured by the detector system
free-in-air showed that the anode heel effect is not in the longitudinal
direction to the z-axis. The image noises measured in Setup A for the air and
bone inserts were systematically higher compared to those measured in Setup B,
in average about 3% and 4% for the air and bone inserts, respectively. An
opposite behavior has been observed for the polyethylene, water-equivalent and
acrylic inserts. The corresponding image noises were in average about 4%, 6%
and 2% lower measured in Setup A compared to those measured in Setup B. SNR for
all inserts behaves inversely to the image noise.
  Conclusion: The patient alignment has a minor influence on the image quality
of CACT. This effect is not based on the X-ray anode heel effect. It is caused
mainly. This effect is caused mainly by the non-symmetrical rotation of the
CACT.

exponential nature of these preferences, compact representations are needed and
($m$)CP-nets are among the most studied ones. Sequential and global voting are
two ways to aggregate preferences over CP-nets. In the former, preferences are
aggregated feature-by-feature. Hence, when preferences have specific feature
dependencies, sequential voting may exhibit voting paradoxes, i.e., it might
select sub-optimal outcomes. To avoid paradoxes in sequential voting, one has
often assumed the $\mathcal{O}$-legality restriction, which imposes a shared
topological order among all the CP-nets. On the contrary, in global voting,
CP-nets are considered as a whole during preference aggregation. For this
reason, global voting is immune from paradoxes, and there is no need to impose
restrictions over the CP-nets' topological structure. Sequential voting over
$\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has extensively been investigated. On the other
hand, global voting over non-$\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has not carefully been
analyzed, despite it was stated in the literature that a theoretical comparison
between global and sequential voting was promising and a precise complexity
analysis for global voting has been asked for multiple times. In quite few
works, very partial results on the complexity of global voting over CP-nets
have been given. We start to fill this gap by carrying out a thorough
complexity analysis of Pareto and majority global voting over not necessarily
$\mathcal{O}$-legal acyclic binary polynomially connected (m)CP-nets. We settle
these problems in the polynomial hierarchy, and some of them in PTIME or
LOGSPACE, whereas EXPTIME was the previously known upper bound for most of
them. We show various tight lower bounds and matching upper bounds for problems

  heavy ions: key role of interplay between material microstructure and
  irradiation temperature","This version has been communicated (for publication)",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Yttria stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) pellets with different crystallite sizes
were irradiated with 80 MeV Ag$^{6+}$ ions at room temperature and 1000 K to
understand the role of crystallite size/material microstructure and irradiation
temperature on the radiation tolerance against high electronic energy loss
(S$_e$). X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that,
irrespective of the irradiation temperature, the nano-crystalline samples
suffered more damage as compared to the bulk-like sample. A reduction in the
irradiation damage i.e. improvement in the radiation tolerance, was observed
for all the samples irradiated at 1000 K. The reduction in the damage, however,
was remarkably higher for the two nano-crystalline samples compared to the
bulk-like sample, and hence the difference in the damage between the bulk-like
and nano-crystalline samples was also significantly lower at 1000 K than that
at room temperature. The irradiation damage, against S$_e$, was thus found to
be critically dependent on the interplay between the irradiation temperature
and crystallite size. These results are explained with the help of detailed
theoretical calculations/simulations based on the 'in-elastic thermal spike'
model by taking into consideration the combined effect of crystallite size and
environmental (irradiation) temperature on the electron-phonon coupling factor
and lattice thermal conductivity (and hence on the resulting thermal spike).
Our results are crucial from the fundamental perspective of comprehending the
size and temperature dependent radiation damage against S$_e$ ; and also for a
number of applications, in various radiation environments, where nano-materials
are being envisioned for use.

report theoretical prediction and experimental observation of acoustic
second-order topological insulators (SOTI) in two-dimensional (2D) sonic

and degenerate in-gap corner states which manifest bulk-edge correspondence in
a hierarchy of dimensions. Moreover, topological transitions in both the bulk

unit-cell, leading to various conversion among bulk, edge and corner states.
The emergent properties of the acoustic SOTIs open up a new route for
topological designs of robust localized acoustic modes as well as topological

making approximations to the full transport equation. In this work, we compare
CCSN simulations in one- and two-dimensions with three approximate neutrino
transport schemes, each implemented in the {\tt FLASH} simulation framework. We
compare a two moment M1 scheme with an analytic closure (M1), the Isotropic

PNS mass, and the mass accretion rate. The neutrino luminosities, mean

promising approach to quantum information processing [1, 2], complementary to
superconducting qubits [3]. Typically, semiconductor qubit-qubit coupling is
short range [1, 2, 4, 5], effectively limiting qubit distance to the spatial
extent of the wavefunction of the confined particle, which represents a
significant constraint towards scaling to reach dense 1D or 2D arrays of QD

coupling regime between the charge [7, 8] and spin [9, 10, 11] degrees of
freedom of electrons confined in semiconducting QDs interacting with individual
photons stored in a microwave resonator has recently been achieved. In this
letter, we demonstrate coherent coupling between a superconducting transmon
qubit and a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit mediated by
virtual microwave photon excitations in a tunable high-impedance SQUID array
resonator acting as a quantum bus [12, 13, 14]. The transmon-charge qubit
coherent coupling rate ($ \sim$ 21 MHz) exceeds the linewidth of both the
transmon ($ \sim$ 0.8 MHz) and the DQD charge ($ \sim$ 3 MHz) qubit. By tuning
the qubits into resonance for a controlled amount of time, we observe coherent
oscillations between the constituents of this hybrid quantum system. These
results enable a new class of experiments exploring the use of the two-qubit
interactions mediated by microwave photons to create entangled states between
semiconductor and superconducting qubits. The methods and techniques presented

semi-classical phase noise using a spin interacting with a continuous-wave (CW)
resonant excitation field has recently gained attention. CW noise spectroscopy
protocols have been based on the generalized Bloch equations (GBE) or the
filter function formalism, assuming weak coupling to a Markovian bath. However,
this standard protocol can substantially underestimate $S(\omega)$ at low
frequencies when the CW pulse amplitude becomes comparable to $S(\omega)$.
Here, we derive the coherence decay function more generally by extending it to
higher orders in the noise strength and discarding the Markov approximation.
Numerical simulations show that this provides a more accurate description of
the spin dynamics compared to a simple exponential decay, especially on short
timescales. Exploiting these results, we devise a protocol that uses an

to changes in the position and orientation of objects in the world. For
example, consider a peg-in-hole insertion task. If the agent learns to insert a
peg into one hole, we would like that policy to generalize to holes presented
in different poses. Unfortunately, this is a challenge using conventional
methods. This paper proposes a novel state and action abstraction that is
invariant to pose shifts called \textit{deictic image maps} that can be used
with deep reinforcement learning. We provide broad conditions under which
optimal abstract policies are optimal for the underlying system. Finally, we
show that the method can help solve challenging robotic manipulation problems.

  Recovery and its Impact on Travel Time Estimation","Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Connected vehicles (CVs) can capture and transmit detailed data such as
vehicle position and speed through vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. The wealth of CV data provides new
opportunities to improve safety and mobility of transportation systems.
However, it is likely to overburden storage and communication systems. To
mitigate this issue, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) approach that allows
CVs to capture and compress data in real-time and later recover the original
data accurately and efficiently. The approach is evaluated using two case
studies. In the first study, we use this approach to recapture 10 million CV
Basic Safety Message (BSM) speed samples. It can recover the original speed
data with root-mean-squared error as low as 0.05. We also explore recovery
performance for other BSM variables. In the second study, a freeway traffic
simulation model is built to evaluate the impact of this approach on travel
time estimation. Multiple scenarios with various CV market penetration rates,
On-board Unit (OBU) capacities, compression ratios, arrival rate patterns, and
data capture rates are simulated. The results show that the approach provides
more accurate estimation than conventional data collection methods, through up
to 65% relative reduction in travel time estimation error. Even when the
compression ratio is low, the approach can provide accurate estimation, thereby
reducing OBU hardware costs. Further, it can improve accuracy of travel time
estimation when CVs are in traffic congestion as it provides a broader
spatial-temporal coverage of traffic conditions and can accurately and
efficiently recover the original CV data.

the CH. As such, the evolutionary pattern in the magnetic field clearly follows
the three-phase evolution (growing, maximum and decaying phase) as found from
EUV data (Part I). This evolutionary process is most likely driven by strong
FTs with a mean magnetic field strength exceeding 50 G. During the maximum
phase they entail up to 72% of the total signed magnetic flux of the CH, but
only cover up to 3.9% of the total CH area, whereas during the growing and

the companion by comparing our observed spectra with BT-Settl models and

used a joint radial velocity and astrometric fit to simulate the companion's
orbit. The companion was found to be 4.14 mag fainter than the primary in the
H2 band, residing at a physical separation of $\sim$ 25 AU, with a
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ and spectral type of 3321 $\pm$ 111 K and M 4.1 $\pm$ 1.1,
respectively. We note that the age derived from BT-Settl models for such a star
is too low by over two orders of magnitude, similar to other known field mid-M
stars. We searched for the radial velocity companion to HD 90520 without any
clear detection, however we reached a low contrast level of $\Delta$H2 = 10.3
mag (or $1.3 * 10^{-4}$) at 0.2$''$ and 12.6 mag (or $10^{-5}$) at 0.5$''$,
allowing us to rule out any low-mass companions with masses of 0.07 and 0.05

opportunity to better constrain the mass-luminosity relation for low-mass stars

must act consistently with existing conventions (e.g. how to navigate in

group's conventions can be viewed as a choice of equilibrium in a coordination
game. We consider the problem of an agent learning a policy for a coordination
game in a simulated environment and then using this policy when it enters an
existing group. When there are multiple possible conventions we show that
learning a policy via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is likely to
find policies which achieve high payoffs at training time but fail to
coordinate with the real group into which the agent enters. We assume access to
a small number of samples of behavior from the true convention and show that we
can augment the MARL objective to help it find policies consistent with the
real group's convention. In three environments from the literature - traffic,
communication, and team coordination - we observe that augmenting MARL with a
small amount of imitation learning greatly increases the probability that the
strategy found by MARL fits well with the existing social convention. We show
that this works even in an environment where standard training methods very
rarely find the true convention of the agent's partners.

Specifically, we prove that under strong convexity and second-order smoothness,

general a dependence on n is unavoidable without further changes to the

research rely heavily on subjective bias. Clear decision structure of the
medical diagnostics lets us approximate the decision process of a radiologist
as a model - removed from subjective bias. We define the process of
interpretation as a finite communication between a known model and a black-box
model to optimally map the black box's decision process in the known model.
Consequently, we define interpretability as maximal information gain over the
initial uncertainty about the black-box's decision within finite communication.
We relax this definition based on the observation that diagnostic
interpretation is typically achieved by a process of minimal querying. We
derive an algorithm to calculate diagnostic interpretability. The usual
question of accuracy-interpretability tradeoff, i.e. whether a black-box

reproduce the results of Grimm et al., 2018 of planets b, d and g having small

if the cores for these planets are roughly Earth-sized (33 wt%), significant
water fractions up to 40 wt% are possible. We show planets c, e, f, and h can
have volatile envelopes between 0-35 wt% that are also consistent with being
totally oxidized and lacking an Fe-core entirely. We note here that a pure
MgSiO$_3$ planet (Fe/Mg = 0) is not the true lowest density end-member
mass-radius curve for determining the probability of a planet containing
volatiles. All planets that are rocky likely contain some Fe, either within the
core or oxidized in the mantle. We argue the true low density end-member for
oxidizing systems is instead a planet with the lowest reasonable Fe/Mg and
completely core-less. Using this logic, we assert that planets b, d and g
likely must have significant volatile layers because the end-member planet

applying the path integral approach to quantize the magnetic flux. Here, we
show how this result can be generalized to higher dimensions, considering a
special type of inhomogeneous geometries. Our results apply to a vast range of
theories and situations in which topological charges are present. For
concreteness, we focus here on Lovelock--Maxwell solutions and show that the
magnetic flux corresponds to a topological excitation and the electric flux
becomes discrete.

  (IJRR) 2019. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1710.08577",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on vision-based pose estimation for multiple rigid objects
placed in clutter, especially in cases involving occlusions and objects resting
on each other. Progress has been achieved recently in object recognition given
advancements in deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a
large amount of training data and significant manual effort to label objects.
This limits their applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a
large number of objects and variety of conditions. Moreover, the combinatorial
nature of the scenes that could arise from the placement of multiple objects is
hard to capture in the training dataset. Thus, the learned models might not
produce the desired level of precision required for tasks, such as robotic
manipulation. This work proposes an autonomous process for pose estimation that
spans from data generation to scene-level reasoning and self-learning. In
particular, the proposed framework first generates a labeled dataset for
training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection in clutter.
These detections are used to guide a scene-level optimization process, which
considers the interactions between the different objects present in the clutter
to output pose estimates of high precision. Furthermore, confident estimates
are used to label online real images from multiple views and re-train the
process in a self-learning pipeline. Experimental results indicate that this
process is quickly able to identify in cluttered scenes physically-consistent
object poses that are more precise than the ones found by reasoning over
individual instances of objects. Furthermore, the quality of pose estimates
increases over time given the self-learning process.

is considered for a single-level vibrating quantum dot coupled to two

new non-trivial formula for the effective transmission coefficient and
differential conductance for resonant magnetopolaron-assisted tunneling is
obtained under the assumption about a fermion-boson factorization of
corresponding averages. This approach is valid for the case of weak
magnetopolaronic coupling in a system. Surprisingly, it is found that despite a
supposed weakness of interaction between fermionic and bosonic subsystems in
that case, a strongly correlated electron transport in the system reveals
features of strong (and, hence, anomalous) magnetopolaronic blockade at zero

nonzero) energy parameter in the system. Such an effect should be referred to
as magnetic phase-coherent magnetopolaron-assisted resonant tunneling of
Andreev type, that originates from a special, Majorana-like, symmetry of
magnetopolaron-coupled tunnel Hamiltonian. The effect predicted in this paper

${\mathcal Jor}(L)$, which is a Jordan superalgebra. This notion was introduced
by the second author before. Now we study further applications of this
construction. First, we show that the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of a Jordan
superalgebra can be an arbitrary number $\{0\}\cup [1,+\infty]$. Thus, unlike
associative and Jordan algebras, one hasn't an analogue of Bergman's gap
$(1,2)$ for the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of Jordan superalgebras. Second,
using the Lie superalgebra $\mathbf R$ constructed before, we construct a
Jordan superalgebra $\mathbf J={\mathcal Jor}({\mathbf R})$ that is nil finely
$\mathbb Z^3$-graded, in contrast with non-existence of such examples (roughly
speaking, analogues of the Grigorchuk and Gupta-Sidki groups) of Lie algebras
in characteristic zero and Jordan algebras in characteristic not 2. Also,
$\mathbf J$ is just infinite but not hereditary just infinite. A similar Jordan
superalgebra of slow polynomial growth was constructed before. The virtue of
the present example is that it is of linear growth, of finite width 4, namely,
its $\mathbb N$-gradation by degree in the generators has components of
dimensions $\{0,2,3,4\}$, and the sequence of these dimensions is non-periodic.
Third, we review constructions of Poisson and Jordan superalgebras starting
with another example of a Lie superalgebra. We discuss the notion of
self-similarity for Lie, associative, Poisson, and Jordan superalgebras. We
also discuss the notion of a wreath product in case of Jordan superalgebras.

discuss the design of a bi-directional serial link running at 6.25 Gbps based
on a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA. The link is protected against single event upsets by
means of all the above-mentioned methods. A self-synchronizing scrambler is
used for DC-balance and data randomization, while the subsequent Reed-Solomon
encoder/decoder detects and corrects bursts of errors in the transmitted data.
The error correction capability of the line code is further increased by
adopting the interleaving technique. Besides, in order to completely take
advantage of available bandwidth and to cope with different rates of
radiation-induced faults, the link can modulate the protection level of the
Reed-Solomon code. The reliability of the link is also improved by means of
modular redundancy on the frame alignment block. Besides, on the same FPGA, a
scrubber repairs corrupted configuration frames in real-time. We present the
test results carried out using the fault injection method. We show the
performance of the link in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF) and fault

attenuate white Gaussian additive noise in a given image modality under the aid

consists of two stages: coupled sparse coding and reconstruction. The first
stage performs joint sparse transform for multimodal images with respect to a
group of learned coupled dictionaries, followed by a shrinkage operation on the
sparse representations. Then, in the second stage, the shrunken
representations, together with coupled dictionaries, contribute to the
reconstruction of the denoised image via an inverse transform. The proposed
denoising scheme demonstrates the capability to capture both the common and
distinct features of different data modalities. This capability makes our
approach more robust to inconsistencies between the guidance and the target
images, thereby overcoming drawbacks such as the texture copying artifacts.
Experiments on real multimodal images demonstrate that the proposed approach is
able to better employ guidance information to bring notable benefits in the
image denoising task with respect to the state-of-the-art.

based on the utilisation of generic beam shape functions to approximate
distributed kinematic properties of the deformed structure. The proposed
nonlinear beam shapes approach is in contrast to the majority of geometrically
nonlinear treatments in the literature in which element based --- and hence
high order --- discretisations are adopted. The kinematic quantities
approximated specifically pertain to shear and extensional gradients as well as
local orientation parameters based on an arbitrary set of globally referenced
attitude parameters. In developing the dynamic equations of motion, an Euler
angle parameterisation is selected as it is found to yield fast computational
performance. The resulting dynamic formulation is closed using an example shape
function set satisfying the single generic kinematic constraint. The
formulation is demonstrated via its application to the modelling of a series of
static and dynamic test cases of both simple and non-prismatic structures; the

such as automated irrigation systems, precision planting, variable rate
applications of nutrients and pesticides, and agricultural decision support
systems. In the latter, crop management data analysis, based on machine
learning and data mining, focuses mainly on how to efficiently forecast and
improve crop yield. In recent years, raw and semi-processed agricultural data
are usually collected using sensors, robots, satellites, weather stations, farm
equipment, farmers and agribusinesses while the Internet of Things (IoT) should
deliver the promise of wirelessly connecting objects and devices in the
agricultural ecosystem. Agricultural data typically captures information about
farming entities and operations. Every farming entity encapsulates an
individual farming concept, such as field, crop, seed, soil, temperature,
humidity, pest, and weed. Agricultural datasets are spatial, temporal, complex,
heterogeneous, non-standardized, and very large. In particular, agricultural
data is considered as Big Data in terms of volume, variety, velocity and
veracity. Designing and developing a data warehouse for precision agriculture
is a key foundation for establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will
enable resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. Some of
the requirements for such an agricultural data warehouse are privacy, security,
and real-time access among its stakeholders (e.g., farmers, farm equipment
manufacturers, agribusinesses, co-operative societies, customers and possibly
Government agencies). However, currently there are very few reports in the
literature that focus on the design of efficient data warehouses with the view
of enabling Agricultural Big Data analysis and data mining. In this paper ...

critical to establish the appropriate protocols to maintain the same data

realistic context while maintaining the scientific rigour, and it is structured
in a modular and scalable way so it can also be easily adapted for online or
brick-and-mortar experimental laboratories. Following citizen science
guidelines, the platform is designed to motivate a more general population into
participation, but also to promote engaging and learning of the scientific
research process. We also review the main results of the experiments performed
using the platform up to now, and the set of games that each experiment

heterogeneity of the samples of the experiments and their satisfaction level,
and the parameters that demonstrate the robustness of the platform and the

be shared, resulting in laborious human efforts to manually collect,
de-identify, and summarize patient information for use in clinical studies.
  Purpose: Conduct feasibility study for a Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) clinical
trial in an Accountable Care Organization. Measure prevalence of RA and related
conditions matching study criteria. Evaluate automation of patient
de-identification and summarization to support patient cohort development for
clinical studies.
  Methods: Collect original clinical documentation directly from the provider
EHR system and extract clinical concepts necessary for matching study criteria.
Automatically de-identify Protected Health Information (PHI) protect patient
privacy and promote sharing. Leverage existing physician expert knowledge
sources to enable analysis of patient populations.
  Results: Prevalence of RA was four percent (4%) in the study population (mean

high prevalence of diabetes and diseases of the circulatory system, as
expected. De-identification accurately removed 99% of PHI identifiers with 99%

to unknown numerical attributes. The semantic labels could be numerical
properties in ontologies, instances in knowledge bases, or labeled data that
are manually annotated by domain experts. In this paper, we refer to semantic
labeling as a retrieval setting where the label of an unknown attribute is
assigned by the label of the most relevant attribute in labeled data. One of
the greatest challenges is that an unknown attribute rarely has the same set of
values with the similar one in the labeled data. To overcome the issue,
statistical interpretation of value distribution is taken into account.
However, the existing studies assume a specific form of distribution. It is not
appropriate in particular to apply open data where there is no knowledge of
data in advance. To address these problems, we propose a neural numerical
embedding model (EmbNum) to learn useful representation vectors for numerical
attributes without prior assumptions on the distribution of data. Then, the
""semantic similarities"" between the attributes are measured on these
representation vectors by the Euclidean distance. Our empirical experiments on

tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in multicenter water-fat MRI

  Methods: The two fully convolutional network architectures U-Net and V-Net
were trained, evaluated and compared on the water-fat MRI data. Data of the
study Tellus with 90 scans from a single center was used for a 10-fold
cross-validation in which the most successful configuration for both networks
was determined. These configurations were then tested on 20 scans of the
multicenter study beta-cell function in JUvenile Diabetes and Obesity

  Results: The U-Net outperformed the used implementation of the V-Net in both
cross-validation and testing. In cross-validation, the U-Net reached average
dice scores of 0.988 (VAT) and 0.992 (SAT). The average of the absolute
quantification errors amount to 0.67% (VAT) and 0.39% (SAT). On the

  Conclusion: The segmentations generated by the U-Net allow for reliable
quantification and could therefore be viable for high-quality automated
measurements of VAT and SAT in large-scale studies with minimal need for human
intervention. The high performance on the multicenter test data furthermore
shows the robustness of this approach for data of different patient

pose a significant performance and power challenge for modern compute

weight and feature map buffering requirements as well as energy consumption.
While a small reduction in accuracy is encountered, these Quantized Neural
Networks have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on standard
benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and even ImageNet, and thus
provide highly attractive design trade-offs. Current research has focused
mainly on the implementation of extreme variants with full binarization of
weights and or activations, as well typically smaller input images. Within this
paper, we investigate the scalability of dataflow architectures with respect to
supporting various precisions for both weights and activations, larger image
dimensions, and increasing numbers of feature map channels. Key contributions
are a formalized approach to understanding the scalability of the existing

conditions of a given quantum mechanical problem, is far-reaching in the sense
that they play a crucial role in the dynamics of solar absorption and the
corresponding optical transitions that follow. Processes like optical
transitions in localized and delocalized states and probabilities of
intermolecular transitions can be investigated through this generalized
off-diagonal Ehrenfest theorem, employed in the present work for the first

the extended Ehrenfest theorem can be separated into bulk and surface

collaborating to give the correct time-derivative of the desired optical

optical transitions in topologically nontrivial quantum systems. It is also
demonstrated through two examples in the literature as well as through a new

Australians discovered the variability of the red star Betelgeuse in the modern

Antares. This result has excited the usual healthy skepticism, with questions
about whether any untrained peoples can discover the variability and whether
such a discovery is likely to be placed into lore and transmitted for long
periods of time. Here, I am offering an independent evaluation, based on broad
experience with naked-eye sky viewing and astro-history. I find that it is easy
for inexperienced observers to detect the variability of Betelgeuse over its
range in brightness from V = 0.0 to V = 1.3, for example in noticing from
season-to-season that the star varies from significantly brighter than Procyon
to being greatly fainter than Procyon. Further, indigenous peoples in the
Southern Hemisphere inevitably kept watch on the prominent red star, so it is
inevitable that the variability of Betelgeuse was discovered many times over
during the last 65 millennia. The processes of placing this discovery into a
cultural context (in this case, put into morality stories) and the faithful
transmission for many millennia is confidently known for the Aboriginal
Australians in particular. So this shows that the whole claim for a changing
Betelgeuse in the Aboriginal Australian lore is both plausible and likely.
Given that the discovery and transmission is easily possible, the real proof is
that the Aboriginal lore gives an unambiguous statement that these stars do
indeed vary in brightness, as collected by many ethnographers over a century
ago from many Aboriginal groups. So I strongly conclude that the Aboriginal
Australians could and did discover the variability of Betelgeuse, Aldebaran,
and Antares.
