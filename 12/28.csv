tests can be very low for strongly correlated errors. This counterintuitive
phenomenon has become known as the ""zero-power trap"". Despite a considerable
amount of literature devoted to this problem, mainly focusing on its detection,
a convincing solution has not yet been found. In this article we first discuss
theoretical results concerning the occurrence of the zero-power trap

initial test that suffers from the zero-power trap, the method we recommend for
practice leads to a modified test whose power converges to one as the
correlation gets very strong. Furthermore, the modified test has approximately
the same power function as the initial test, and thus approximately preserves
all of its optimality properties. We also provide some numerical illustrations
in the context of testing for network generated correlation.

support qualitative as well as quantitative analysis. The quantitative approach
is based on values associated to each node in the tree, expressing, for
instance, the minimal cost or probability of an attack. Current quantitative
methods for attack trees allow the analyst to, based on an initial assignment
of values to the leaf nodes, derive the values of the higher nodes in the tree.
In practice, however, it shows to be very difficult to obtain reliable values
for all leaf nodes. The main reasons are that data is only available for some
of the nodes, that data is available for intermediate nodes rather than for the
leaf nodes, or even that the available data is inconsistent. We address these
problems by developing a generalisation of the standard bottom-up calculation
method in three ways. First, we allow initial attributions of non-leaf nodes.
Second, we admit additional relations between attack steps beyond those
provided by the underlying attack tree semantics. Third, we support the
calculation of an approximative solution in case of inconsistencies. We
illustrate our method, which is based on constraint programming, by a
comprehensive case study.

competition in 2018, university teams advanced the state of the art by using
context in dialog models, leveraging knowledge graphs for language
understanding, handling complex utterances, building statistical and
hierarchical dialog managers, and leveraging model-driven signals from user
responses. The 2018 competition also included the provision of a suite of tools
and models to the competitors including the CoBot (conversational bot) toolkit,
topic and dialog act detection models, conversation evaluators, and a sensitive
content detection model so that the competing teams could focus on building
knowledge-rich, coherent and engaging multi-turn dialog systems. This paper
outlines the advances developed by the university teams as well as the Alexa
Prize team to achieve the common goal of advancing the science of
Conversational AI. We address several key open-ended problems such as
conversational speech recognition, open domain natural language understanding,
commonsense reasoning, statistical dialog management, and dialog evaluation.
These collaborative efforts have driven improved experiences by Alexa users to
an average rating of 3.61, the median duration of 2 mins 18 seconds, and
average turns to 14.6, increases of 14%, 92%, 54% respectively since the launch

length-biased sampling has received extensive interest. Many inference methods
have been developed for various survival models. These methods, however, break
down when survival data are typically error-contaminated. Although error-prone
survival data commonly arise in practice, little work has been available in the
literature for handling length-biased data with measurement error. In survival
analysis, the transformation model is one of the frequently used models.
However, methods of analyzing the transformation model with those complex
features have not been fully explored. In this paper, we study this important
problem and develop a valid inference method under the transformation model. We
establish asymptotic results for the proposed estimators. The proposed method
enjoys appealing features in that there is no need to specify the distribution
of the covariates and the increasing function in the transformation model.
Numerical studies are reported to assess the performance of the proposed
method.

  Hertzsprung-Russell diagram","Accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sty3527",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive protostars grow and evolve under the effect of rapid accretion of
circumstellar gas and dust, falling at high rates ($\ge 10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}\, \rm
M_{\odot}\, \rm yr^{-1}$). This mass infall has been shown, both numerically
and observationally, to be episodically interspersed by accretion of dense
gaseous clumps migrating through the circumstellar disc to the protostellar
surface, causing sudden accretion and luminous bursts. Using numerical
gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics and stellar evolution calculations, we
demonstrate that, in addition to the known bloating of massive protostars,
variable episodic accretion further influences their evolutionary tracks of
massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). For each accretion-driven flare, they
experience rapid excursions toward more luminous, but colder regions of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. During these excursions, which can occur up to the
end of the pre-main-sequence evolution, the photosphere of massive protostars
can episodically release much less energetic photons and MYSOs surreptitiously
adopt the same spectral type as evolved massive (supergiants) stars. Each of
these evolutionary loop brings the young high-mass stars close to the forbidden
Hayashi region and might make their surrounding H II regions occasionally
fainter, before they recover their quiescent, pre-burst surface properties. We
interpret such cold, intermittent pre-main-sequence stellar evolutionary
excursions and the dipping variability of HII regions as the signature of the
presence of a fragmenting circumstellar accretion disc surrounding the MYSOs.
We conjecture that this mechanism might equivalently affect young stars in the
intermediate-mass regime.

CHYMERA, a radiative 3D hydrodynamics code. The onset of GIs in the
circumbinary disc is much more violent due to the stimulation of a strong
one-armed density wave by the brown dwarf. Despite this early difference,
detailed analyses show that both discs relax to a very similar quasi-steady
phase by 2,500 years after the beginning of the simulations. Similarities
include the thermodynamics of the quasi-steady phase, the final surface density
distribution, radial mass influx, and nonaxisymmetric power and torques for
spiral arm multiplicities of two or more. Effects of binarity in the disc are
evident in gravitational torque profiles, temperature profiles in the inner
discs, and radial mass transport. After 3,800 years, the semimajor axis of the
binary decreases by about one percentage and the eccentricity roughly doubles.

neural networks and statistical morphable body models, such as the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL). However, regardless of the advantages of
having both body pose and shape, SMPL-based solutions have shown difficulties
to predict 3D bodies accurately. This is mainly due to the unconstrained nature
of SMPL, which may generate unrealistic body meshes. Because of this,
regression of SMPL parameters is a difficult task, often addressed with complex
regularization terms. In this paper we propose to embed SMPL within a deep
model to accurately estimate 3D pose and shape from a still RGB image. We use
CNN-based 3D joint predictions as an intermediate representation to regress
SMPL pose and shape parameters. Later, 3D joints are reconstructed again in the
SMPL output. This module can be seen as an autoencoder where the encoder is a
deep neural network and the decoder is SMPL model. We refer to this as SMPL
reverse (SMPLR). By implementing SMPLR as an encoder-decoder we avoid the need
of complex constraints on pose and shape. Furthermore, given that in-the-wild
datasets usually lack accurate 3D annotations, it is desirable to lift 2D
joints to 3D without pairing 3D annotations with RGB images. Therefore, we also
propose a denoising autoencoder (DAE) module between CNN and SMPLR, able to
lift 2D joints to 3D and partially recover from structured error. We evaluate
our method on SURREAL and Human3.6M datasets, showing improvement over
SMPL-based state-of-the-art alternatives by about 4 and 25 millimeters,

graph partitioning problems, Goemans and Williamson showed how to formulate and
round a complex semidefinite program to give what is to date still the
best-known approximation guarantee of .836008 for Max-$3$-Cut. (This
approximation ratio was also achieved independently by De Klerk et al.) Goemans
and Williamson left open the problem of how to apply their techniques to
Max-$k$-Cut for general $k$. They point out that it does not seem
straightforward or even possible to formulate a good quality complex
semidefinite program for the general Max-$k$-Cut problem, which presents a
barrier for the further application of their techniques.
  We present a simple rounding algorithm for the standard semidefinite
programmming relaxation of Max-$k$-Cut and show that it is equivalent to the
rounding of Goemans and Williamson in the case of Max-$3$-Cut. This allows us
to transfer the elegant analysis of Goemans and Williamson for Max-3-Cut to
Max-$k$-Cut. For $k \geq 4$, the resulting approximation ratios are about $.01$
worse than the best known guarantees. Finally, we present a generalization of
our rounding algorithm and conjecture (based on computational observations)
that it matches the best-known guarantees of De Klerk et al.

  As CPLS is provably total in the theory $T^2_2$, this shows that
$\mathrm{APC}_2$ does not prove every $\forall \Sigma^b_1$ sentence which is
provable in bounded arithmetic. This answers the question posed in [Buss,

separating the levels of the bounded arithmetic hierarchy by low-complexity

partial oracle from a certain distribution will, with high probability,
determine an entire computation of a $\textrm{P}^{\textrm{NP}}$ oracle machine.

adding formally infinite forces acting on either side of each plate, while in

pivotal tool for intelligent video-based systems aiming to solve tasks such as
pedestrian tracking, social distancing monitoring or pedestrian mass counting.
Pedestrian detection methods, even the top performing ones, are highly
sensitive to occlusions among pedestrians, which dramatically degrades their
performance in crowded scenarios. The generalization of multi-camera set-ups
permits to better confront occlusions by combining information from different
viewpoints. In this paper, we present a multi-camera approach to globally
combine pedestrian detections leveraging automatically extracted scene context.
Contrarily to the majority of the methods of the state-of-the-art, the proposed
approach is scene-agnostic, not requiring a tailored adaptation to the target
scenario\textemdash e.g., via fine-tunning. This noteworthy attribute does not
require \textit{ad hoc} training with labelled data, expediting the deployment
of the proposed method in real-world situations. Context information, obtained
via semantic segmentation, is used 1) to automatically generate a common Area
of Interest for the scene and all the cameras, avoiding the usual need of
manually defining it; and 2) to obtain detections for each camera by solving a
global optimization problem that maximizes coherence of detections both in each
2D image and in the 3D scene. This process yields tightly-fitted bounding boxes
that circumvent occlusions or miss-detections. Experimental results on five
publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-camera pedestrian detectors, even some specifically
trained on the target scenario, signifying the versatility and robustness of
the proposed method without requiring ad-hoc annotations nor human-guided
configuration.

stability and perturbativity condition as also with the LHC constraints. They
are finally constrained by the PLANCK results for dark matter relic densities.
The direct detection limits are then ensured to have satisfied by the model. We
then explore within the framework of the model, the possible signatures of
synchrotron radiation from the annihilations of dark matter in the Galactic
Centre region when the end product is $e^+e^-$. We consider the observational
data from the radio telescopes namely SKA, GMRT and Jodrell Bank telescopes and

advantage of quantum devices. Here we develop a deep-reinforcement-learning
based approach for quantum adiabatic algorithm design. Our approach is
generically applicable to a class of problems with solution hard-to-find but
easy-to-verify, e.g., searching and NP-complete problems. We benchmark this
approach in Grover-search and 3-SAT problems, and find that the
adiabatic-algorithm obtained by our RL approach leads to significant
improvement in the resultant success probability. In application to Grover
search, our RL-design automatically produces an adiabatic quantum algorithm
that has the quadratic speedup. We find for all our studied cases that
quantitatively the RL-designed algorithm has a better performance compared to
the analytically constructed non-linear Hamiltonian path when the encoding
Hamiltonian is solvable, and that this RL-design approach remains applicable
even when the non-linear Hamiltonian path is not analytically available. In
3-SAT, we find RL-design has fascinating transferability---the adiabatic
algorithm obtained by training on a specific choice of clause number leads to
better performance consistently over the linear algorithm on different clause
numbers. These findings suggest the applicability of reinforcement learning for
automated quantum adiabatic algorithm design. Further considering the
established complexity-equivalence of circuit and adiabatic quantum algorithms,
we expect the RL-designed adiabatic algorithm to inspire novel circuit
algorithms as well. Our approach is potentially applicable to different quantum
hardwares from trapped-ions and optical-lattices to superconducting-qubit

films in the creep regime, alter the distribution of currents and magnetic
fields near and far from the indentation. One of such disturbances are the
discontinuity lines, or \textit{d}-lines, a parabolic-like line originating
from the indentation where the current density direction changes abruptly.
Hodograph series results are obtained for the currents around a triangular
indentation and its corresponding $d$-lines in a conducting stripe of finite
width and in an infinite half plane, considering two cases: uniform creep
exponent and mixed infinite and ohmic exponents. The mixed creep exponent case
presents currents distributions resembling the purely ohmic case, with
significant current disturbances only near the indentation. For uniform creep
exponent, results similar to a planar indentation are obtained, with far ranged
currents features and parabolic-like $d$-lines with shapes depending on the
creep exponent. In particular, the same $d$-line asymptotic behaviour is
obtained for the triangle indentation as that of the planar defect in the
critical state, a result obtained here just on continuity considerations of the
hodograph expansions. This equivalence is due to identical contributions to the
Fourier series of the current stream-function in the hodograph space, obtained
from an images method expansion.

  Model","41 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental diagram of pedestrian dynamics gives the relation between the
density and the flow within a specific enclosure. It is characterized by two
distinctive behaviors: the free-flow regime (for low densities) and the
congested regime (for high densities). In the former, the flow is an increasing
function of the density, while in the latter, the flow remains on hold or
decreases. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of the pilgrimage at
the entrance of the Jamaraat bridge (pedestrians walking along a straight
corridor) and compare flow-density measurements with empirical measurements
made by Helbing[1]. We show that under high density conditions, the basic
Social Force Model (SFM) does not completely handle the fundamental diagram
reported in empirical measurements. We use analytical techniques and numerical
simulations to prove that with an appropriate modification of the friction
coefficient (but sustaining the SFM) it is possible to attain behaviors which
are in qualitative agreement with the empirical data. Other authors have
already proposed a modification of the relaxation time in order to address this
problem. In this work, we unveil the fact that our approach is analogous to
theirs since both affect the same term of the reduced-in-units equation of
motion. We show how the friction modification affects the pedestrian clustering
structures throughout the transition from the free-flow regime to the congested
regime. We also show that the speed profile, normalized by width and maximum
velocity yields a universal behavior regardless of the corridor dimensions.

systems such as autonomous driving. Recently, DNN testing has been intensively
studied to automatically generate adversarial examples, which inject
small-magnitude perturbations into inputs to test DNNs under extreme
situations. While existing testing techniques prove to be effective, they
mostly focus on generating digital adversarial perturbations (particularly for
autonomous driving), e.g., changing image pixels, which may never happen in
physical world. There is a critical missing piece in the literature on
autonomous driving testing: understanding and exploiting both digital and
physical adversarial perturbation generation for impacting steering decisions.
In this paper, we present DeepBillboard, a systematic physical-world testing
approach targeting at a common and practical driving scenario: drive-by
billboards. DeepBillboard is capable of generating a robust and resilient
printable adversarial billboard, which works under dynamic changing driving
conditions including viewing angle, distance, and lighting. The objective is to
maximize the possibility, degree, and duration of the steering-angle errors of
an autonomous vehicle driving by the generated adversarial billboard. We have
extensively evaluated the efficacy and robustness of DeepBillboard through
conducting both digital and physical-world experiments. Results show that
DeepBillboard is effective for various steering models and scenes. Furthermore,
DeepBillboard is sufficiently robust and resilient for generating
physical-world adversarial billboard tests for real-world driving under various
weather conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating the possibility of generating realistic and continuous
physical-world tests for practical autonomous driving systems.

diffeomorphism and Weyl invariant 3D theory containing first, second, and third

with a boundary additional surface terms are required for the boundary Weyl

conformal Galileon plus a boundary term. On the other hand, it reduces to a
generalization of ""New Massive Gravity"" by A. Sinha, if the Weyl symmetry is
gauge-fixed in a particular way. Last but not least, there exists a parameter

theory of particles at a given string level, or as a particle model for Born
geometries. The first additional feature of the model is the presence of an
additional local symmetry, which from the string point of view corresponds to
the completion of worldsheet diffeomorphism invariance. From the particle
world-line point of view, this symmetry is associated with an additional local
constraint. The second feature is the presence of a non-trivial symplectic form
on the metaparticle phase space, also motivated by string theory [1, 2].
Because of its interpretation as a particle model on Born geometry, the
space-time on which the metaparticle propagates is ambiguous, with different
choices related by what in string theory we would call T-duality. In this
paper, we define the model, and explore some of its principle classical and
quantum properties, including causality and unitarity.

acceleration (ASA), which arises from fundamental dynamics of MHD turbulence.
The ASA acts to flatten the injected energy spectrum of electrons at low
energies, while synchrotron cooling results in a steep spectrum of electrons at
high energies. Their dominance in different energy ranges leads to a flat radio
spectrum ($F_\nu$) and a steep X-ray spectrum. Our analytical spectral shapes
generally agree well with the observed synchrotron spectra of radio- and

  In this paper, for each triple of positive integers $(c,h,f)$ satisfying
\[c^{2}-f\,h^{2}=1, \] where $(c,h)$ are the smallest pair of integers
satisfying this equation, several sets of polynomials $(c(t),h(t),f(t))$ which
satisfy \[c(t)^{2}-f(t)\,h(t)^{2}=1 \text{ and } (c(0),h(0),f(0)) = (c,h,f) \]

fundamental polynomial solution to the Pell's equation above. The continued
fraction expansion of $\sqrt{f(t)}$ is given in certain general cases (for
example, when the continued fraction expansion of $\sqrt{f}$ has odd period
length, or even period length or has period length $\equiv 2 \mod{4}$ and the
middle quotient has a particular form etc). Some applications to determining
the fundamental unit in real quadratic fields is also discussed.

that design is a high impedance, as seen by a beam, because of the magnet
laminations. More recent RCS designs (e.g. J-PARC) employ large and complex
ceramic vacuum chambers in order to mitigate the eddy current effects and to
shield the beam from the magnet laminations. Such a design, albeit very
successful, is quite costly because it requires large-bore magnets and
large-bore RF cavities. In this article, we will consider an RCS concept with a

maintaining the possibility to reconstruct a high quality XRF image. The
proposed adaptive image sampling algorithm is applied to the RGB image of the
scanning target to generate the sampling mask. The XRF scanner is then driven
according to the sampling mask to scan a subset of the total image pixels.
Finally, we inpaint the scanned XRF image by fusing the RGB image to

(TDW), which has applications in collision-free routing of discrete objects
(e.g., autonomous vehicles) over a network. This problem takes as input a
digraph $G$ with positive integer arc lengths, and $k$ pairs of vertices that
each represent a trip demand from a source to a destination. The goal is to
find a walk and delay for each demand so that no two trips occupy the same
vertex at the same time, and so that a min-max or min-sum objective over the
trip durations is realized.
  We focus here on the min-sum variant of Time Disjoint Walks, although most of
our results carry over to the min-max case. We restrict our study to various
subclasses of DAGs, and observe that there is a sharp complexity boundary
between Time Disjoint Walks on oriented stars and on oriented stars with the
central vertex replaced by a path. In particular, we present a poly-time
algorithm for min-sum and min-max TDW on the former, but show that min-sum TDW
on the latter is NP-hard.
  Our main hardness result is that for DAGs with max degree $\Delta\leq3$,
min-sum Time Disjoint Walks is APX-hard. We present a natural approximation
algorithm for the same class, and provide a tight analysis. In particular, we
prove that it achieves an approximation ratio of $\Theta(k/\log k)$ on
bounded-degree DAGs, and $\Theta(k)$ on DAGs and bounded-degree digraphs.

nanopore selectively binds the analyte ions with which the local concentrations
of the ions of the background electrolyte (KCl), and, thus, the ionic current
flowing through the pore is changed. Analyte concentration can be determined
from calibration curves. In our previous study (M\'{a}dai et al. J. Chem.
Phys., 147(24):244702, 2017.), we proposed a symmetric model (surface charge is
negative all along the pore). The mechanism of sensing was a competition
between K$^{+}$ and positive analyte ions, so increasing analyte concentration
decreased K$^{+}$ current. Here we allow asymmetric charge patterns on the pore
wall (positive/negative/neutral along the pore), thus, gaining an additional
device function, rectification, resulting in a dual responsive device. We find
that a bipolar nanopore is an efficient geometry with Cl$^{-}$ ions being the
main charge carriers. The mechanism of sensing is that more positive analyte
ions attract more Cl$^{-}$ ions into the pore thus increasing the current. Also
they make the pore less asymmetric and, thus, decrease rectification. We use a
hybrid computer simulation method, where a generalization of the grand
canonical Monte Carlo method to non-equilibrium (Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo)
is coupled to the Nernst-Planck equation with which the flux is computed.

for the Morris and Thorne wormhole metric, with constant redshift function,
yields $R(r) = 2b^{\prime}(r)/r^{2}$. Exact wormhole solutions are obtained for
three particular cases: $\rho(r) = \alpha R(r) + \beta R^{\prime}(r)$, $\rho(r)

first ones, traversable wormhole models are obtained. When the matter energy
density is of the 3rd type, only solutions with constant shape may correspond

form of the shape function is taken to be $b(r) = \sqrt{\hat{r}_{0} r}$ and
possible existence of appropriate static traversable wormhole configurations is
proven. These results can be viewed as an initial step towards using specific

asset transfer (or exchange) system. As clearly stated in the original paper by
Nakamoto, the crux of this problem lies in prohibiting any participant from
engaging in double-spending. There seems to be a common belief that consensus
is necessary for solving the double-spending problem. Indeed, whether it is for
a permissionless or a permissioned environment, the typical solution uses
consensus to build a totally ordered ledger of submitted transfers. In this
paper we show that this common belief is false: consensus is not needed to
implement of a decentralized asset transfer system. We do so by introducing AT2
(Asynchronous Trustworthy Transfers), a class of consensusless algorithms. To
show formally that consensus is unnecessary for asset transfers, we consider
this problem first in the shared-memory context. We introduce AT2$_{SM}$, a
wait-free algorithm that asynchronously implements asset transfer in the
read-write shared-memory model. In other words, we show that the consensus
number of an asset-transfer object is one. In the message passing model with
Byzantine faults, we introduce a generic asynchronous algorithm called
AT2$_{MP}$ and discuss two instantiations of this solution. First, AT2$_{D}$
ensures deterministic guarantees and consequently targets a small scale
deployment (tens to hundreds of nodes), typically for a permissioned
environment. Second, AT2$_{P}$ provides probabilistic guarantees and scales
well to a very large system size (tens of thousands of nodes), ensuring
logarithmic latency and communication complexity. Instead of consensus, we
construct AT2$_{D}$ and AT2$_{P}$ on top of a broadcast primitive with causal
ordering guarantees offering deterministic and probabilistic properties,
respectively.

conventional semiparametric DID estimators will cause significant bias and make
these DID estimators fail to be sqrt{N}-consistent. This article proposes three
new DID estimators for three different data structures, which are able to
shrink the bias and achieve sqrt{N}-consistency and asymptotic normality with
mean zero when applying ML methods. This leads to straightforward inferential
procedures. In addition, I show that these new estimators have the small bias
property (SBP), meaning that their bias will converge to zero faster than the
pointwise bias of the nonparametric estimator on which it is based.

each with respective start and goal positions. The task is to find paths for
all agents while avoiding collisions aiming to minimize an objective function.
Two such common objective functions is the sum-of-costs and the makespan. Many
optimal solvers were introduced in the past decade - two prominent categories
of solvers can be distinguished: search-based solvers and compilation-based
solvers.
  Search-based solvers were developed and tested for the sum-of-costs objective
while the most prominent compilation-based solvers that are built around
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) were designed for the makespan objective. Very
little was known on the performance and relevance of the compilation-based
approach on the sum-of-costs objective. In this paper we show how to close the
gap between these cost functions in the compilation-based approach. Moreover we
study applicability of various techniques developed for search-based solvers in
the compilation-based approach.
  A part of this paper introduces a SAT-solver that is directly aimed to solve
the sum-of-costs objective function. Using both a lower bound on the
sum-of-costs and an upper bound on the makespan, we are able to have a
reasonable number of variables in our SAT encoding. We then further improve the
encoding by borrowing ideas from ICTS, a search-based solver. Experimental
evaluation on several domains show that there are many scenarios where our new
SAT-based methods outperforms the best variants of previous sum-of-costs search
solvers - the ICTS, CBS algorithms, and ICBS algorithms.

an infinitesimal body in the neighborhood of the oblate body. The three heavy

  We start by finding the triangular central configurations of the three heavy

equilateral as in the point mass case. We assume that the three heavy bodies
are in such a central configuration and we perform a Hill's approximation of
the equations of motion describing the dynamics of the infinitesimal body in a
neighborhood of the oblate body. Through the use of Hill's variables and a
limiting procedure, this approximation amounts to sending the two other bodies
to infinity. Finally, for the Hill approximation, we find the equilibrium
points of the infinitesimal body and determine their stability. As a motivating
example, we consider the dynamics of the moonlet Skamandrios of Jupiter's

class, the system may support exact many-body zero modes with the symmetries
also dictating whether these may have a nonzero contribution to Majorana
fermions, i.e., single-particle weight. These zero modes appear in all but two
of the symmetry classes. When present, they leave clear signatures in physical
observables that go beyond the threefold (Wigner-Dyson) possibilities for level
spacing statistics studied earlier. Signatures we discover include a
zero-energy peak or hole in the single-particle spectral function, depending on
whether symmetries allow or forbid zero modes to have single-particle weight.
The zero modes are also shown to influence the many-body dynamics, where
signatures include a nonzero long-time limit for the out-of-time-order
correlation function. Furthermore, we show that the extension of the four-body

obtain an explicit formula for the solutions to the corresponding initial value

calculate the sectional curvature and observe that, depending on the dimension

seller's behalf in order to artificially inflate the final price. This is
typically achieved by the seller having friends bid in her auctions, or the
seller controls multiple fake bidder accounts that are used for the sole
purpose of shill bidding. We previously proposed a reputation system referred
to as the Shill Score that indicates how likely a bidder is to be engaging in
price inflating behaviour with regard to a specific seller's auctions. A
potential bidder can observe the other bidders' Shill Scores, and if they are
high, the bidder can elect not to participate as there is some evidence that
shill bidding occurs in the seller's auctions. However, if a seller is in
collusion with other sellers, or controls multiple seller accounts, she can
spread the risk between the various sellers and can reduce suspicion on the
shill bidder. Collusive seller behaviour impacts one of the characteristics of
shill bidding the Shill Score is examining, therefore collusive behaviour can
reduce a bidder's Shill Score. This paper extends the Shill Score to detect
shill bidding where multiple sellers are working in collusion with each other.
We propose an algorithm that provides evidence of whether groups of sellers are
colluding. Based on how tight the association is between the sellers and the
level of apparent shill bidding is occurring in the auctions, each
participating bidder's Shill Score is adjusted appropriately to remove any
advantages from seller collusion. Performance has been tested using simulated
auction data and experimental results are presented.

classical novae (CNe) outbursts but only RNe has more than one recorded
outbursts. RNe play an important role as one of the suspected progenitor
systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) which are used as primary distance
indicators in cosmology. Thus, it is important to investigate the outburst type
of CNe and RNe and finally ascertain the population of objects that might
ultimately be candidates for Type Ia SNe explosions. The proposal that RNe
occupy a region separated from CNe in an outburst amplitude versus speed class
diagram was adopted. Since the low amplitude results from the existence of an
evolved secondary and/or high mass transfer rate in the quiescent system, RNe
candidates should accordingly have low amplitude. We selected 3 preliminary
targets including T Pyx, BT Mon and V574 Pup. Their amplitudes are not that low
but the lowest amplitude that can be observed with Thai National Telescope

(e.g. bounding boxes) or image-level labels (e.g. image categories). In this
paper, we propose a novel recursive coarse-to-fine semantic segmentation
framework based on only image-level category labels. For each image, an initial
coarse mask is first generated by a convolutional neural network-based
unsupervised foreground segmentation model and then is enhanced by a graph
model. The enhanced coarse mask is fed to a fully convolutional neural network
to be recursively refined. Unlike existing image-level label-based semantic
segmentation methods which require to label all categories for images contain
multiple types of objects, our framework only needs one label for each image
and can handle images contains multi-category objects. With only trained on
ImageNet, our framework achieves comparable performance on PASCAL VOC dataset
as other image-level label-based state-of-the-arts of semantic segmentation.
Furthermore, our framework can be easily extended to foreground object
segmentation task and achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art

field, we investigate the possibility of new theories by using the Hamiltonian
analysis. By imposing the degeneracy of the kinetic matrix and the existence of
subsequent constraints, we classify theories based on the number of degrees of
freedom and constraint structures and obtain a wider class of Fierz-Pauli
theory as well as massless and partially massless theories, whose scalar and/or
vector degrees of freedom are absent. We also discuss the relation between our
theories and known massless and massive spin-2 theories.

tremendous potential for interesting physical phenomena as well as applications
in spintronics and quantum computation. In this context, we here study the
interplay between the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and the Kondo screening
in noncentrosymmetric $f$-electron materials. We show that the Kondo coupling
of the $f$-electrons becomes anisotropic at high temperatures due to the RSOC.
However, an isotropic Kondo effect is restored at low temperature which leads
to a complete Kondo screening. We furthermore demonstrate that the Kondo effect
has influence on the Rashba splitting in the band structure, which becomes
temperature dependent. Although the $f$-electrons are localized at high
temperature, a helical spin polarization of the conduction band emerges due to
the scattering with the $f$-electrons. With decreasing temperature, the Kondo
screening occurs, which leads to drastic changes in the band structure.
Remarkably, these changes in the band structure depend on the helical spin
polarization. For strong RSOC, we observe that the hybridization gap of one of
the helical bands is closed at low temperature and a helical half-metal is
formed.

Z-invariance property is shown to also hold for integrable vector models and
interaction-round-a-face (IRF) models of statistical mechanics respectively. As
for the previous case of the STR, the Z-invariance property is shown through
the use of local cubic-type deformations of a 2-dimensional surface associated

considered, and it is shown that an analogous Z-invariance property holds for
the variational formulation of classical discrete Laplace equations which arise

the system. The controller emerges naturally from an optimization problem and
balances exploration and exploitation in such a way that it is able to
efficiently stabilize unstable and adversarial system dynamics. Specifically,
if the controller is faced with large uncertainty, the initial focus is on
exploration, retrieving information about the system by applying state-feedback
controllers with varying gains and signs. In a pre-specified bounded region
around the origin, our control strategy can be seen as passive in the sense
that it learns very little information. Only once the noise and/or system

behaves aggressively in that it is guaranteed to learn enough about the system

this setting, the verifier consists of $n$ nodes and a graph $G$ that defines
their communication pattern. The prover is a single entity that communicates
with all nodes by short messages. The goal is to verify that the graph $G$
belongs to some language in a small number of rounds, and with small
communication bound, i.e., the proof size.
  This interactive model was introduced by Kol, Oshman and Saxena (PODC 2018)
as a generalization of non-interactive distributed proofs. They demonstrated
the power of interaction in this setting by constructing protocols for problems
as Graph Symmetry and Graph Non-Isomorphism -- both of which require proofs of
$\Omega(n^2)$-bits without interaction.
  In this work, we provide a new general framework for distributed interactive
proofs that allows one to translate standard interactive protocols to ones
where the verifier is distributed with short proof size. We show the following:
* Every (centralized) computation that can be performed in time $O(n)$ can be
translated into three-round distributed interactive protocol with $O(\log n)$
proof size. This implies that many graph problems for sparse graphs have
succinct proofs.
  * Every (centralized) computation implemented by either a small space or by
uniform NC circuit can be translated into a distributed protocol with $O(1)$
rounds and $O(\log n)$ bits proof size for the low space case and $polylog(n)$
many rounds and proof size for NC.
  * We show that for Graph Non-Isomorphism, there is a 4-round protocol with
$O(\log n)$ proof size, improving upon the $O(n \log n)$ proof size of Kol et
al.
  * For many problems we show how to reduce proof size below the naturally
seeming barrier of $\log n$. We get a 5-round protocols with proof size $O(\log

itself with devising and analysing protocols, such as quantum key distribution,
without referring to the quality of the physical devices utilised to execute
the protocols. Instead, the analysis is based on the observed correlations that
arise during a repeated interaction with the devices and, in particular, their
ability to violate the so called Bell inequalities.
  Since the analysis of DI protocols holds irrespectively of the underlying
physical device, it implies that any device can be used to execute the
protocols: If the apparatus is of poor quality, the users of the protocol will
detect it and abort; otherwise, they will accomplish their goal. This strong
statement comes at a price-- the analysis of DI protocols is, a priori,
extremely challenging.
  The thesis presents an approach that can be taken to simplify the analysis of
DI information processing protocols. The idea is the following: Instead of
analysing the most general device leading to the observed correlations, one
should first analyse a significantly simpler device that, in each interaction
with the user, behaves in an identical way, independently of all other
interactions. We call such a device an independently and identically
distributed (IID) device. As the next step, special techniques are used to
prove that, without loss of generality, the analysis of the IID device implies
similar results for the most general device. These are termed reductions to
IID.
  We present two mathematical techniques that can be used as reductions to IID
in the DI setting, each accompanied by a showcase-application that exemplifies
the reduction's usage and benefits. Performing the analysis via a reduction to
IID leads to simpler proofs and significant quantitive improvements, matching
the tight results proven when analysing IID devices.

importance of objects is not equal, in terms of criteria such as the utility,
risk, or interest. Besides, another limitation of frequent patterns is that
they generally have a low occupancy, i.e., they often represent small sets of
items in transactions containing many items, and thus may not be truly
representative of these transactions. To extract high quality patterns in real
life applications, this paper extends the occupancy measure to also assess the
utility of patterns in transaction databases. We propose an efficient algorithm
named High Utility Occupancy Pattern Mining (HUOPM). It considers user
preferences in terms of frequency, utility, and occupancy. A novel
Frequency-Utility tree (FU-tree) and two compact data structures, called the
utility-occupancy list and FU-table, are designed to provide global and partial
downward closure properties for pruning the search space. The proposed method
can efficiently discover the complete set of high quality patterns without
candidate generation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several

resulting from non-uniform insolation during a nucleus' spin-orbit evolution is
derived. The resulting partial differential equations that govern the change in
the shape of a nucleus subject to mass loss and consequent collapse of depleted
subsurface structures are solved analytically for simple insolation
configurations and numerically for more realistic scenarios.
  Results. The here proposed mechanism is capable of explaining why a large
fraction of periodic comets appear to have peanut-shaped cores and why
light-curve amplitudes of comet nuclei are on average larger than those of
typical main belt asteroids of the same size.

understanding of nuclear forces is based on a systematic low-energy expansion
called chiral effective field theory. However, recent {\it ab initio}
calculations of nuclear structure have found that not all chiral effective
field theory interactions give accurate predictions with increasing nuclear
density. In this letter we address the reason for this problem and the first
steps toward a solution. Using nuclear lattice simulations, we deduce the
minimal nuclear interaction that can reproduce the ground state properties of
light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, and neutron matter simultaneously with no
more than a few percent error in the energies and charge radii. We find that
only four parameters are needed. With these four parameters one can accurately
describe neutron matter up to saturation density and the ground state
properties of nuclei up to calcium. Given the absence of sign oscillations in
these lattice Monte Carlo simulations and the mild scaling of computational
effort scaling with nucleon number, this work provides a pathway to
high-quality simulations in the future with as many as one or two hundred
nucleons.

active flavors can lead to loss of sensitivity to the $\theta_{23}$ octant
(sign of $\sin^2\theta_{23}-1/2$) in long baseline experiments, because the
main oscillation probability
$P_0=4\sin^2\theta_{23}\sin^2\theta_{13}\sin^2\Delta_{31}$ can be degenerate
with the sum of the interferences with the solar oscillation amplitude and an
active-sterile oscillation amplitude in both neutrino and antineutrino
oscillations, depending on CP phases. In this paper, we show that the above
degeneracy is resolved by measuring the same beam at different baseline
lengths. We demonstrate that Tokai-to-Hyper-Kamiokande-to-Korea (T2HKK)
experiment (one 187~kton fiducial volume water Cerenkov detector is placed at
Kamioka, $L=295$~km, and another detector is put in Korea, $L\sim1000$~km)
exhibits a better sensitivity to the $\theta_{23}$ octant in those parameter
regions where the experiment with two detectors at Kamioka is insensitive to
it. Therefore, if a hint of sterile-active mixings is discovered in short
baseline experiments, T2HKK is a better option than the plan of placing two
detectors at Kamioka. We also consider an alternative case where one detector
is placed at Kamioka and a different detector is at Oki Islands, $L=653$~km,
and show that this configuration also leads to a better sensitivity to the
$\theta_{23}$ octant.

interval i.e. a \emph{range query}, is a fundamental data analysis primitive.
Range queries can also be used to compute other interesting statistics such as
\emph{quantiles}, and to build prediction models. However, frequently the data
is subject to privacy concerns when it is drawn from individuals, and relates
for example to their financial, health, religious or political status. In this
paper, we introduce and analyze methods to support range queries under the
local variant of differential privacy, an emerging standard for
privacy-preserving data analysis.
  The local model requires that each user releases a noisy view of her private
data under a privacy guarantee. While many works address the problem of range
queries in the trusted aggregator setting, this problem has not been addressed
specifically under untrusted aggregation (local DP) model even though many
primitives have been developed recently for estimating a discrete distribution.
We describe and analyze two classes of approaches for range queries, based on
hierarchical histograms and the Haar wavelet transform. We show that both have
strong theoretical accuracy guarantees on variance. In practice, both methods
are fast and require minimal computation and communication resources. Our
experiments show that the wavelet approach is most accurate in high privacy
settings, while the hierarchical approach dominates for weaker privacy
requirements.

median quasi-state on the 2-sphere. In this paper we present an algorithm which
numerically computes it to any specified accuracy. The error estimate of the
algorithm crucially relies on metric continuity properties of a map, which
constructs quasi-states from probability measures, with respect to appropriate
Wasserstein metrics. We close with non-approximation results, particularly for
symplectic quasi-states.

between them depending on the parameter $\Theta$ which controls the coupling of
atoms of honeycomb lattice with atoms in the center of each hexagon, thus,
interpolating between graphene $\Theta=0$ and the dice model $\Theta=\pi/4$.
The middle band becomes flat one with zero energy in the dice model. The bound
electron states are found in the two cases: the centrally symmetric potential
well and a regularized Coulomb potential of the charged impurity. As the charge
of impurity increases, bound state energy levels descend from the upper and
central continua and dive at certain critical charges into the central and
lower continuum, respectively. In the dice model, it is found that the flat
band survives in the presence of a potential well, however, is absent in the
case of the Coulomb potential. The analytical results are presented for the
energy levels near continuum boundaries in the potential well. For the genuine
Coulomb potential, we present the recursion relations that determine the
coefficients of the series expansion of wave functions of bound states. It is
shown that the condition for the termination of the series expansion gives two
equations relating energy and charge values. Hence, analytical solutions can
exist for a countably infinite set of values of impurity charge at fixed

of episodic excursions of low-mass protostars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R)
diagram triggered by strong mass accretion bursts typical of FU Orionis-type
objects (FUors). These excursions reveal themselves as sharp increases in the
stellar total luminosity and/or effective temperature of the protostar and can
last from hundreds to a few thousands of years, depending on the burst strength
and characteristics of the protostar. During the excursions, low-mass
protostars occupy the same part of the H-R diagram as young intermediate-mass
protostars in the quiescent phase of accretion. Moreover, the time spent by
low-mass protostars in these regions is on average a factor of several longer
than that spent by the intermediate-mass stars in quiescence. During the
excursions, low-mass protostars pass close to the position of most known FUors
in the H-R diagram, but owing to intrinsic ambiguity the model stellar
evolutionary tracks are unreliable in determining the FUor properties. We find
that the photospheric luminosity in the outburst state may dominate the
accretion luminosity already after a few years after the onset of the outburst,
meaning that the mass accretion rates of known FUors inferred from the
bolometric luminosity may be systematically overestimated, especially in the
fading phase.

Here we adopt the view that grammatical constraints (such as
subject--predicate--object) locally re-order the word order in sentences that
are sampled with a SSR word generation process. We demonstrate that
superimposing grammatical structure -- as a local word re-ordering
(permutation) process -- on a sample-space reducing process is sufficient to
explain both, word frequencies and word-to-word transition probabilities. We
compare the quality of the grammatically ordered SSR model in reproducing
several test statistics of real texts with other text generation models, such
as the Bernoulli model, the Simon model, and the Monkey typewriting model.

the complex interactions altered in AD. In particular, we aimed to understand
the relationship between vulnerable brain circuits and memory deficits measured
in the Morris water maze, and we tested several predictive modeling approaches.
We used in vivo manganese enhanced MRI voxel based analyses to reveal regional
differences in volume (morphometry), signal intensity (activity), and magnetic
susceptibility (iron deposition, demyelination). These regions included the
hippocampus, olfactory areas, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum. The image based
properties of these regions were used to predict spatial memory. We next used
eigenanatomy, which reduces dimensionality to produce sets of regions that
explain the variance in the data. For each imaging marker, eigenanatomy
revealed networks underpinning a range of cognitive functions including memory,
motor function, and associative learning. Finally, the integration of
multivariate markers in a supervised sparse canonical correlation approach
outperformed single predictor models and had significant correlates to spatial
memory. Among a priori selected regions, the fornix also provided good
predictors, raising the possibility of investigating how disease propagation
within brain networks leads to cognitive deterioration. Our results support
that modeling approaches integrating multivariate imaging markers provide
sensitive predictors of AD-like behaviors. Such strategies for mapping brain
circuits responsible for behaviors may help in the future predict disease
progression, or response to interventions.

buckling offers a wide range of accessible patterns depending on the parameters

experimentally the dynamics of an elastic ring in a soap film when part of the

creates a range of interesting patterns that cannot be easily accessed in

non-trivial modes, the selected pattern does not depend on inertia itself. The
evolution of this pattern beyond the initial instability is studied
experimentally and explained through theoretical arguments linking dynamics to
pattern selection and mode growth. We also explore the influence of dynamic

Recently, Sills provided a bijective proof for this result using binary

using the zigzag graphs of compositions. Extending Sills' bijection, we obtain
a further generalizaiton which is analogous to Franklin's result. We establish,

stochastic background of gravitational waves coming from second order
anisotropic stresses in matter. We study the amplitude and shape of this
background for several phenomenological models of the curvature power spectrum
that can be embedded in waterfall hybrid inflation, axion, domain wall, and
boosts of PBH formation at the QCD transition. For a broad peak or a nearly
scale invariant spectrum, this stochastic background is generically enhanced by
about one order of magnitude, compared to a sharp feature. As a result,
stellar-mass PBH from Gaussian fluctuations with a wide mass distribution are
already in strong tension with the limits from Pulsar Timing Arrays, if they
constitute a non negligible fraction of the Dark Matter. But this result is
mitigated by the uncertainties on the curvature threshold leading to PBH
formation. LISA will have the sensitivity to detect or rule out light PBH down

eastern sector of Campi Flegrei caldera. The Astroni volcano is an important
case study for investigating plumbing system processes and dynamics at Campi
Flegrei caldera because it produced the most recent (ca. 4 ka ago) Plinian
eruption within the caldera (Astroni 6); current long-term forecasting studies
postulate that a similar sized event in this location is a probable future

shallow magma chamber, and a less evolved, deeper pocket of magma, in agreement
with previous studies focused on the Astroni 6 eruption products. In addition,
a range of textural and trace element zoning patterns point to a complex
evolution of both magmas prior to their subsequent interaction. High resolution
trace element crystal maps reveal discrete zonations in compatible elements.
These zonations, combined with knowledge of Kfeldspar growth rates, highlight a

interferometric measurements of mechanical motion due to measurement
backaction, the nonlinear nature of the coupling also leads to parametric
instabilities that place practical limits on the sensitivity by limiting the
power in the interferometer. Such instabilities have been extensively studied
in the context of gravitational wave detectors, and their presence has recently
been reported in Advanced LIGO. Here, we observe experimentally and describe
theoretically a new type of optomechanical instability that arises in two-tone
backaction-evading (BAE) measurements, designed to overcome the standard
quantum limit, and demonstrate the effect in the optical domain with a photonic
crystal nanobeam, and in the microwave domain with a micromechanical oscillator
coupled to a microwave resonator. In contrast to the well-known oscillatory
parametric instability that occurs in single-tone, blue-detuned pumping, which
is characterized by a vanishing effective mechanical damping, the parametric
instability in balanced two-tone optomechanics is exponential, and is a result
of small detuning errors in the two pump frequencies. Its origin can be
understood in a rotating frame as the vanishing of the effective mechanical
frequency due to an optical spring effect. Counterintuitively, the instability
occurs even in the presence of perfectly balanced intracavity fields, and can
occur for both signs of detuning. We find excellent quantitative agreement with
our theoretical predictions. Since the constraints on tuning accuracy become
stricter with increasing probe power, it imposes a fundamental limitation on
BAE measurements, as well as other two-tone schemes. In addition to introducing
a new limitation in two-tone BAE measurements, the results also introduce a new
type of nonlinear dynamics in cavity optomechanics.

SST (FSST for short) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the
time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a
multicomponent non-stationary signal. Very recently the FSST with a
time-varying parameter, called the adaptive FSST, was introduced. The
simulation experiments show that the adaptive FSST is very promising in
instantaneous frequency estimation of the component of a multicomponent signal,
and in accurate component recovery. However the theoretical analysis of the

a fundamental goal of product design firms. There is accordingly a long history
of quantitative approaches that aim to capture diverse consumer preferences,
and then translate those preferences to corresponding ""design gaps"" in the
market. We extend this work by developing a deep learning approach to predict
design gaps in the market. These design gaps represent clusters of designs that
do not yet exist, but are predicted to be both (1) highly preferred by
consumers, and (2) feasible to build under engineering and manufacturing
constraints. This approach is tested on the entire U.S. automotive market using
of millions of real purchase data. We retroactively predict design gaps in the
market, and compare predicted design gaps with actual known successful designs.
Our preliminary results give evidence it may be possible to predict design
gaps, suggesting this approach has promise for early identification of market
opportunity.

DOF has been introduced into photonic systems, and several valley-Hall photonic
topological insulators (PTIs) have been experimentally demonstrated. However,
in the previous valley-Hall PTIs, topological kink states only work at a single
frequency band, which limits potential applications in multiband waveguides,

experimentally demonstrate a valley-Hall PTI, where the topological kink states
exist at two separated frequency bands, in a microwave substrate-integrated
circuitry. Both the simulated and experimental results demonstrate the
dual-band valley-Hall topological kink states are robust against the sharp

$R^2$ inflation is induced by quantum correction effect from the large
Higgs-curvature (graviton) coupling. We start with non-minimal coupling HS
action in Jordan frame. We then transform the Jordan frame action into the
Einstein one using the conformal transformation. The inflation potential is
derived from the gravitational action of non-minimal-Higgs coupling and
Starobinsky term in Einstein frame where the $R^2$ term is dominated in the
inflationary phase of the universe. For model of inflation, we compute the
inflationary parameters and confront them with Planck 2015 data. We discover
that the predictions of the model are in excellent agreement with the Planck
analysis. In addition, we study the Higgs field as a candidate for dark matter.
The renormalization group equations (RGEs) of Higgs-Starobinsky scenario with
standard model at one-loop is qualitatively analyzed. By using the solutions of
parameter spaces from RGE analysis, the remnants of the quantum effect ($R^2$

to find optimal hyper parameters. Whenever the objective function is
non-convex, non continuous and with potentially multiple local minima, standard

method is to assume that the optimum(s), not necessarily unique, is/are
distributed according to a distribution and iteratively to adapt the
distribution according to tested points. These strategies originated in the
early 1960s, named Evolution Strategy (ES) have culminated with the CMA-ES
(Covariance Matrix Adaptation) ES. It relies on a multi variate normal
distribution and is supposed to be state of the art for general optimization
program. However, it is far from being optimal for discrete variables. In this
paper, we extend the method to multivariate binomial correlated distributions.
For such a distribution, we show that it shares similar features to the multi
variate normal: independence and correlation is equivalent and correlation is
efficiently modeled by interaction between different variables. We discuss this
distribution in the framework of the exponential family. We prove that the
model can estimate not only pairwise interactions among the two variables but
also is capable of modeling higher order interactions. This allows creating a
version of CMA ES that can accommodate efficiently discrete variables. We
provide the corresponding algorithm and conclude.

in future fusion reactors. In-service, fusion neutron irradiation creates
lattice defects through collision cascades. Helium, injected from plasma,
aggravates damage by increasing defect retention. Both can be mimicked using
helium-ion-implantation. In a recent study on 3000 appm helium-implanted
tungsten (W-3000He), we hypothesized helium-induced irradiation hardening,
followed by softening during deformation. The hypothesis was founded on
observations of large increase in hardness, substantial pile-up and slip-step
formation around nano-indents and Laue diffraction measurements of localised
deformation underlying indents. Here we test this hypothesis by implementing it
in a crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) formulation, simulating
nano-indentation in W-3000He at 300 K. The model considers thermally-activated
dislocation glide through helium-defect obstacles, whose barrier strength is
derived as a function of defect concentration and morphology. Only one fitting
parameter is used for the simulated helium-implanted tungsten; defect removal
rate. The simulation captures the localised large pile-up remarkably well and
predicts confined fields of lattice distortions and geometrically necessary
dislocation underlying indents which agree quantitatively with previous Laue
measurements. Strain localisation is further confirmed through high resolution
electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
measurements on cross-section lift-outs from centre of nano-indents in
W-3000He.

clinical decision making procedure. The primary challenge in healthcare systems
is handling the demand uncertainty over the time. This issue becomes more
critical for the healthcare facilities that provide service for chronic disease
treatment because of the need for continuous treatments over the time. Although
some researchers focused on exploring the methods for workload prediction
recently, few types of research mainly focused on forecasting a quantitative
measure for the workload of healthcare providers. Also, among the mentioned
studies most of them just focused on workload prediction within one facility.
The drawback of the previous studies is the problem is not investigated for
multiple facilities where the quality of provided service, the equipment, and
resources used for provided service as well as the diagnosis and treatment
procedures may differ even for patients with similar conditions. To tackle the
mentioned issue, this paper suggests a framework for patient workload
prediction by using patients data from VA facilities across the US. To capture
the information of patients with similar attributes and make the prediction
more accurate, a heuristic cluster based algorithm for single task learning as
well as a multi task learning approach are developed in this research.

fifth generation (5G) wireless systems to achieve the expected 1000x data rate.
With large bandwidth at mmWave band, the link capacity between users and base
stations (BS) can be much higher compared to sub-6GHz wireless systems.
Meanwhile, due to the high cost of infrastructure upgrade, it would be
difficult for operators to drastically enhance the capacity of backhaul links
between mmWave BSs and the core network. As a result, the data rate provided by
backhaul may not be sufficient to support all mmWave links, the backhaul
connection becomes the new bottleneck that limits the system performance. On
the other hand, as mmWave channels are subject to random blockage, the data
rates of mmWave users significantly vary over time. With limited backhaul
capacity and highly dynamic data rates of users, how to allocate backhaul
resource to each user remains a challenge for mmWave systems. In this article,
we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address this
challenge. By learning the blockage pattern, the system dynamics can be
captured and predicted, resulting in efficient utilization of backhaul
resource. We begin with a discussion on DRL and its application in wireless
systems. We then investigate the problem backhaul resource allocation and
present the DRL based solution. Finally, we discuss open problems for future
research and conclude this article.

Quantum Mechanics [1]. In the following, it is pointed out that their
conclusion of one of three common-sense conditions, demanded for Quantum
Mechanics, being inevitably and permanently violated is not inevitable; there
is a way out. Here, it is argued for fully accepting encompassing
complementarity and for a basic conceptualization of quantum mechanics, in
which different aspects are exhibited under different circumstances. The
reported result is taken as an indication of a fundamental arrow of time
pointing in the direction from the quantum --> classical domain. With the
origin of thermodynamic time at that interface, its unrestricted applicability
in isolated quantum systems is questioned. The bold proposal is that TIME as we
know it just does not exist at the quantum level. Time instead commences
together with causality at all interfaces to the classic domain whenever a
minimum amount of energy is transferred in an uncontrolled manner, i.e.,
without well-balanced compensation. Insisting on fully comprehensive
self-consistency opens new perspectives on (retro-)causality and also on an
inflation phase at the beginnings of our universe.

perspective of an urban mobility service. Assuming traveler behavior is in
accordance with the principle of utility maximization, we first formulate a
baseline dynamical model for traveler's expected future trip sequence under the
framework of Markov decision processes and from which we derive approximations
of the optimal coupon redemption policy. However, we find that this baseline
model cannot explain perfectly observed coupon redemption behavior of traveler
for a car-sharing service. To resolve this deviation from utility-maximizing
behavior, we suggest a hypothesis that travelers may not be aware of all
coupons available to them. Based on this hypothesis, we formulate an
inattention model on unawareness, which is complementary to the existing models
of inattention, and incorporate it into the baseline model. Estimation results
show that the proposed model better explains the coupon redemption dataset than
the baseline model. We also conduct a simulation experiment to quantify the
negative impact of unawareness on coupons' promotional effects. These results
can be used by mobility service operators to design effective coupon
distribution schemes in practice.
