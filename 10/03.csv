nonlinear energy of an hyperelastic material body subject to an equilibrated
force field. We show that the strains of minimizing sequences associated to
re-scaled non linear energies weakly converge, up to subsequences, to the
strains of minimizers of a limit energy, provided an additional compatibility
condition is fulfilled by the force field. The limit energy is different from
classical energy of linear elasticity; nevertheless the compatibility condition
entails the coincidence of related minima and minimizers. A strong violation of
this condition provides a limit energy which is unbounded from below, while a
mild violation may produce a limit energy with infinitely many extra minimizers
which are not minimizers of standard linear elastic energy and whose strains
are not uniformly bounded. A relevant consequence of this analysis is that a
rigorous validation of linear elasticity fails for compressive force fields
that do not fulfil such compatibility condition.

that capturing these invariants is beneficial for a naive agent trying to

momentum in the computational subspace. Each component couples to an
independently-controllable external bias, emulating the Zeeman effect due to a
fictitious, vector magnetic field, and all three of these vector components
remain relatively constant over a broad range of emulated total fields around
zero. This capability, combined with established techniques for qubit coupling,
should enable for the first time the direct hardware emulation of nearly

diamond anvil cell and laser heated on microsecond timescales, we observe an
onset of metal-like reflectivity in the visible spectral range at P>150 GPa and
T>3000 K. The reflectance increases rapidly with decreasing photon energy
indicating free-electron metallic behavior with a plasma edge in the visible
spectral range at high temperatures. The reflectivity spectra also suggest much
longer electronic collision time (>1 fs) than previously inferred, implying
that metallic hydrogens at the conditions studied are not in the regime of
saturated conductivity (Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit). Combined with previously
reported data, our results suggest the existence of a semiconducting
intermediate fluid hydrogen state en route to metallization.

a fixed-target experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron, which studies
hadron production in hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions for various

kaons) are collided with a light nuclear target (carbon, aluminum, and
beryllium) and spectra of outgoing hadrons are measured. These proceedings will

DenseNet while using much fewer parameters. In addition, due to high model
complexity, the network with extremely dense feature reuse is prone to
overfitting. To address this problem, a regularization method named Stochastic

decomposition in terms of intrinsic operations on the group of volume
preserving diffeomorphism or on the full diffeomorphism group. In this setting,
the mean of an ensemble of maps can be defined as the Riemannian center of mass

Lagrangian averaging where equations of motion for the mean flow arise via a
variational principle from a mean Lagrangian, obtained from the kinetic energy
Lagrangian of ideal fluid flow via a small amplitude expansion for the
fluctuations.
  We show that the Euler-$\alpha$ equations arise as Lagrangian averaged Euler
equations when using the $L^2$-geodesic mean on the volume preserving
diffeomorphism group of a manifold without boundaries, imposing a `Taylor
hypothesis', which states that first order fluctuations are transported as a
vector field by the mean flow, and assuming that fluctuations are statistically
isotropic. Similarly, the EPDiff equations arise as the Lagrangian averaged

exhibit ""small-on-top"" stratification with an accumulation (depletion) of
smaller (larger) particles in the top region of the drying film, consistent
with the prediction of current theories based on diffusiophoresis. However,
when only the region near the substrate is thermalized at a constant
temperature, a negative temperature gradient develops in the suspension because
of evaporative cooling at the liquid-vapor interface. Since the associated
thermophoresis is stronger for larger nanoparticles, a higher fraction of
larger nanoparticles migrate to the top of the drying film at fast evaporation
rates. As a result, stratification is converted to ""large-on-top"". Very strong
""small-on-top"" stratification can be produced with a positive thermal gradient
in the drying suspension. Here we explore a way to produce a positive thermal
gradient by thermalizing the vapor at a temperature higher than that of the

better how stellar evolution and structure are affected by variations of the

accepted solar values. We aim to use the existing spectrophotometric,
interferometric and asteroseismic data for the solar twin 18 Sco to constrain
stellar evolution models. 18 Sco is the brightest solar twin and is a good
benchmark for the study of solar twins. The goal is to obtain realistic
estimates of its physical characteristics (mass, age, initial chemical
composition, mixing-length parameter) and realistic associated uncertainties
using stellar models. We set up a Bayesian model that relates the statistical
properties of the data to the probability density of the stellar parameters.
Special care is given to the modelling of the likelihood for the seismic data,
using Gaussian mixture models. The probability densities of the stellar
parameters are approximated numerically using an adaptive MCMC algorithm. From
these approximate distributions we proceeded to a statistical analysis. We also
performed the same exercise using local optimisation. The precision on the mass
is approximately 6%. The precision reached on X0 and Z0 and the mixing-length
parameter are respectively 6%, 9%, and 35%. The posterior density for the age
is bimodal, with modes at 4.67 Gyr and 6.95 Gyr, the first one being slightly
more likely. We show that this bimodality is directly related to the structure
of the seismic data. When asteroseismic data or interferometric data are

super-Earths undergo runaway gas accretion to become gas giants. However, the
exoplanet census revealed the prevalence of super-Earths close to their host
stars, which should have avoided runaway gas accretion. In fact, mass-radius
relationships of transiting planets suggest that some close-in super-Earths
possess H$_2$/He atmospheres of ~ 0.1-10% by mass. Previous studies indicated
that properties of a disk gas such as metallicity and the inflow/outflow cycle
of a disk gas around a super-Earth can regulate accumulation of a H$_2$/He
atmosphere onto itself. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism that radial
mass accretion in a disk can limit the gas accretion onto super-Earth cores.
Recent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations found that magnetically driven disk
winds can drive a rapid gas flow near the disk surface. Such a rapid gas flow
may slip out of a planetary core and regulate gas supply to an accreting gas
onto the core. We performed N-body simulations for formation of super-Earths
with accretion of atmospheres in a viscous accretion disk including effects of
wind-driven accretion. We found that even super-Earth cores can avoid
triggering runaway gas accretion if the inflow of a disk gas toward the cores
is limited by viscous accretion. Our model predicts that super-Earths having
H$_2$/He atmosphere of ~ 0.1-10 wt % form within $\lesssim$ 1 au of the central
star, whereas gas giants are born in the outer region. This mechanism can
explain the radial dependence of observed giant planets beyond the solar

the use of simple and explainable global anomaly detectors. In this paper, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop learning algorithm called GLAD (GLocalized
Anomaly Detection) that supports global anomaly detectors. GLAD automatically
learns their local relevance to specific data instances using label feedback
from human analysts. The key idea is to place a uniform prior on the relevance
of each member of the anomaly detection ensemble over the input feature space
via a neural network trained on unlabeled instances. Subsequently, weights of
the neural network are tuned to adjust the local relevance of each ensemble
member using all labeled instances. GLAD also provides explanations which can
improve the understanding of end-users about anomalies. Our experiments on
synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of GLAD in learning the
local relevance of ensemble members and discovering anomalies via label
feedback.

To constrain the physical processes that lead to the birth of high-mass
stars it is mandatory to study the very first stages of their formation. We
search for high-mass analogs of low-mass prestellar cores in W43-MM1.
  Methods. We conducted a 1.3 mm ALMA mosaic of the complete W43-MM1 cloud,
which has revealed numerous cores with ~ 2000 au FWHM sizes. We investigated
the nature of cores located at the tip of the main filament, where the
clustering is minimum. We used the continuum emission to measure the core
masses and the $^{13}$CS(5-4) line emission to estimate their turbulence level.
We also investigated the prestellar or protostellar nature of these cores by
searching for outflow signatures traced by CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) line emission,
and for molecular complexity typical of embedded hot cores.
  Results. Two high-mass cores of ~ 1300 au diameter and ~ $60~M_\odot$ mass
are observed to be turbulent but gravitationally bound. One drives outflows and
is associated with a hot core. The other core, W43-MM1\#6, does not yet reveal
any star formation activity and thus is an excellent high-mass prestellar core
candidate.

  Models",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern data analysis pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the
presence of multi-view information sources. While graphs are effective in
modeling complex relationships, in many scenarios a single graph is rarely
sufficient to succinctly represent all interactions, and hence multi-layered
graphs have become popular. Though this leads to richer representations,
extending solutions from the single-graph case is not straightforward.
Consequently, there is a strong need for novel solutions to solve classical
problems, such as node classification, in the multi-layered case. In this
paper, we consider the problem of semi-supervised learning with multi-layered
graphs. Though deep network embeddings, e.g. DeepWalk, are widely adopted for
community discovery, we argue that feature learning with random node
attributes, using graph neural networks, can be more effective. To this end, we
propose to use attention models for effective feature learning, and develop two
novel architectures, GrAMME-SG and GrAMME-Fusion, that exploit the inter-layer
dependencies for building multi-layered graph embeddings. Using empirical
studies on several benchmark datasets, we evaluate the proposed approaches and
demonstrate significant performance improvements in comparison to
state-of-the-art network embedding strategies. The results also show that using
simple random features is an effective choice, even in cases where explicit
node attributes are not available.

evasion attacks) or training time (i.e., poisoning attacks) has emerged as a
challenging task. It is known that for some natural settings, sublinear
perturbations in the training phase or the testing phase can drastically
decrease the quality of the predictions. These negative results, however, are
information theoretic and only prove the existence of such successful
adversarial perturbations. A natural question for these settings is whether or
not we can make classifiers computationally robust to polynomial-time attacks.
  In this work, we prove strong barriers against achieving such envisioned
computational robustness both for evasion and poisoning attacks. In particular,
we show that if the test instances come from a product distribution (e.g.,
uniform over $\{0,1\}^n$ or $[0,1]^n$, or isotropic $n$-variate Gaussian) and
that there is an initial constant error, then there exists a polynomial-time
attack that finds adversarial examples of Hamming distance $O(\sqrt n)$. For
poisoning attacks, we prove that for any learning algorithm with sample
complexity $m$ and any efficiently computable ""predicate"" defining some ""bad""
property $B$ for the produced hypothesis (e.g., failing on a particular test)
that happens with an initial constant probability, there exist polynomial-time
online poisoning attacks that tamper with $O (\sqrt m)$ many examples, replace
them with other correctly labeled examples, and increases the probability of
the bad event $B$ to $\approx 1$.
  Both of our poisoning and evasion attacks are black-box in how they access
their corresponding components of the system (i.e., the hypothesis, the
concept, and the learning algorithm) and make no further assumptions about the
classifier or the learning algorithm producing the classifier.

their approaches. Gauge dependence is dealt with through the $ \hbar
$-expansion, which establishes and maintains a strict loop-order separation of
terms. On the other hand, IR divergences seem to require a resummation that
mixes the different loop orders. In this paper we test these methods on Fermi
gauge Abelian Higgs at two loops. We find that the resummation procedure is not
capable of removing all divergences. Surprisingly, the $ \hbar $-expansion
seems to be able to deal with both the divergences and the gauge dependence. In
order to isolate the physical part of $ V_{\text{min}} $, we are guided by the
separation of scales that motivated the resummation procedure; the key result
is that only hard momentum modes contribute to $ V_{\text{min}} $.

state-of-the-art software to extract high-precision astrometry from images. We
then modelled these time-series data, and compared microlensing model fits to
simple linear proper-motion fits for each selected star. We find no evidence
for astrometric microlensing in M 22, in particular for Bulge stars, which are
much more likely to be lensed than cluster stars, due to the geometry of
microlensing events. Although it is in principle possible to derive mass limits
from such non-detections, we find that no useful mass limits can be derived for
M 22 with available data, mostly due to a 10-year gap in coverage. This is a
result from difficulties with deriving precise enough astrometry from Wide

transitions ($L'_{\rm CO} \sim 10^9$ K km s$^{-1}$) in two $z \sim 0.5$
galaxies associated with one Ly$\alpha$ absorber towards J0238+1636. The CO
spectral line energy distribution (CO SLED) of these galaxies appear distinct
from that of typical star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts and is
comparable with that of luminous infrared galaxies or AGN. Indeed, these
galaxies are associated with optically identified AGN activity. We infer that
the CO line ratios and the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ conversion factor differ from the
Galactic values. Our findings suggest that at least a fraction of absorption
selected systems shows ISM conditions deviating from those of normal
star-forming galaxies. For a robust molecular gas mass calculation, it is
therefore important to construct the CO SLED. Absorption-line-selection
identifies systems with widely distributed gas, which may preferentially select
interacting galaxies, which in turn will have more excited CO SLEDs than
isolated galaxies. Furthermore, we raise the question whether quasar absorbers
preferentially trace galaxy overdensities.

lowest energies, common wisdom says that quasiparticles become unstable when
they encounter the inevitable continuum of many-particle excited states at high
energies. Whilst correct for weak interactions, we show that this is far from
the whole story: strong interactions generically stabilise quasiparticles by
pushing them out of the continuum. This general mechanism is straightforwardly
illustrated in an exactly solvable model. Using state-of-the-art numerics, we
find it at work also in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular lattice Heisenberg

specifying the position of the bodies (camera, Sun, planets, satellites) over

which varies from $\sim 7\%-21\%$, showing the highest values in the narrowband
filters J0395, J0410, and J0430. This ICL fraction excess is distinctive
pattern recently observed in dynamically active clusters (mergers), indicating
a higher amount of bluer stars in the ICL compared to the cluster galaxies.
Both the high ICL fractions and the excess in the bluer filters are indicative
of a merging state. The presence of younger/lower-metallicity stars the ICL
suggests that the main mechanism of ICL formation for the Coma cluster is the
stripping of the stars in the outskirts of infalling galaxies and, possibly,
the disruption of dwarf galaxies during past/ongoing mergers.

discs of galaxies settle, leading to the formation of bars; (ii) testing the
hypothesis whereby discs in more massive galaxies are assembled first; and
(iii) characterising the history of external gas accretion in disc galaxies. We
present details on the sample selection, observations, data reduction, and
derivation of high-level data products, including stellar kinematics, ages and
metallicities. We also derive star formation histories and physical properties
and kinematics of ionised gas. We illustrate how this dataset can be used for a
plethora of scientific applications, e.g., stellar feedback, outflows, nuclear

and stellar dynamics of nuclear spiral arms, barlenses, box/peanuts and bulges.
Amongst our first results - based on a few selected galaxies -, we show that
the dynamics of nuclear rings and inner discs is consistent with the picture in
which they are formed by bars, that the central few hundred parsecs in massive
disc galaxies tend to show a pronounced peak in stellar metallicity, and that
nuclear rings can efficiently prevent star formation in this region. Finally,
we present evidence that star-bursting nuclear rings can be fed with
low-metallicity gas from low-mass companions.

$U(1)$ gauge symmetry under which the PIDM is charged, but remains only
gravitationally coupled to the Standard Model (SM). Contrary to ""hidden charged
dark matter"", the charged PIDM never reaches thermal equilibrium with the SM.
The dark sector is populated by freeze-in via gravitational interactions at
reheating. If the dark fine-structure constant $\alpha_D$ is larger than about
$10^{-3}$, the dark sector thermalizes within itself, and the PIDM abundance is
further modified by freeze-out in the dark sector. Interestingly, this largely
reduces the dependence of the final abundance on the reheating temperature, as
compared to an uncharged PIDM. Thermalization within the dark sector is driven
by inelastic radiative processes, and affected by the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal
(LPM) effect. The observed CDM abundance can be obtained over a wide mass range
from the weak to the GUT scale, and for phenomenologically interesting
couplings $\alpha_D\sim 10^{-2}$. Due to the different thermal history, the

pressure is up to three orders of magnitude lower than the other terms. We

integer polynomial optimization problems. Available hardware restricts the
Hamiltonians to be of a structure that allows only pairwise interactions. This
requires that the original optimization problem to be first converted -- from
its polynomial form -- to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
problem, which we frame as a problem in algebraic geometry. Additionally, the
hardware graph where such a QUBO-Hamiltonian needs to be embedded -- assigning
variables of the problem to the qubits of the physical optimizer -- is not a
complete graph, but rather one with limited connectivity. This ""problem graph
to hardware graph"" embedding can also be framed as a problem of computing a
Groebner basis of a certain specially constructed polynomial ideal. We develop
a systematic computational approach to prepare a given polynomial optimization
problem for AQC in three steps. The first step reduces an input polynomial
optimization problem into a QUBO through the computation of the Groebner basis
of a toric ideal generated from the monomials of the input objective function.
The second step computes feasible embeddings. The third step computes the
spectral gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian associated to a given embedding.
These steps are applicable well beyond the integer polynomial optimization
problem. Our paper provides the first general purpose computational procedure
that can be used directly as a $translator$ to solve polynomial integer
optimization. Alternatively, it can be used as a test-bed (with small size
problems) to help design efficient heuristic quantum compilers by studying
various choices of reductions and embeddings in a systematic and comprehensive
manner. An added benefit of our framework is in designing Ising architectures

transmitter at the drone and a UWB receiver at the ground, we carry out A2G
channel measurements to capture the link quality at the ground receiver for
various link distances, drone heights, and antenna orientations. We develop a
simple analytical model to approximate the influence of 3D antenna patterns on
the received signal strength (RSS), which show reasonable agreement with
measurements despite the simplicity of the model and the complicated 3D
radiation from the UWB antennas. We also explore how the signal strength can be
improved when multiple antennas with different orientations are utilized at
transmitter/receiver.

holographic systems signals generated by a source could reappear long after
they have dissipated, with the need of only performing some simple operations.
In this paper we argue the phenomenon, to which we refer as ""regenesis"", is
universal in general quantum chaotic many-body systems, and elucidate its
underlying physics. The essential elements behind the phenomenon are: (i)
scrambling which in a chaotic system makes out-of-time-ordered correlation
functions (OTOCs) vanish at large times; (ii) the entanglement structure of the
state of the system. The latter aspect also implies that the regenesis
phenomenon requires fine tuning of the initial state. Compared to other
manifestations of quantum chaos such as the initial growth of OTOCs which deals
with early times, and a random matrix-type energy spectrum which reflects very
large time behavior, regenesis concerns with intermediate times, of order the
scrambling time of a system. We also study the phenomenon in detail in general
two-dimensional conformal field theories in the large central charge limit, and
highlight some interesting features including a resonant enhancement of
regenesis signals near the scrambling time and their oscillations in coupling.
Finally, we discuss gravity implications of the phenomenon for systems with a
gravity dual, arguing that there exist regimes for which traversability of a
wormhole is quantum in nature, i.e. cannot be associated with a semi-classical
spacetime causal structure.

create lithography weakpoints after their cell instances are placed and routed,
even though each of these cells does not contain any lithography weakpoint

shown that abutted standard cell instances can induce lithography weakpoints.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose methodologies that are used in a novel
software system for checking standard cells in terms of the aforementioned
lithography issues. Specifically, the software system is capable of detecting
and sorting problematic standard cells which are prone to generate lithography
weakpoints, as well as reporting standard cells that should not be abutted.

turbulent flames relative to their corresponding laminar flames. This work is
based on a lean n-dodecane-air flame DNS database from Aspden et al. (Proc.
Combust. Institute, 36 (2017) 2005-2016). The relative roles of dominant
reactions that release heat and produce/consume radicals are examined at
various turbulence intensities and compared with stretched flame calculations
from counterflow flames and perfectly stirred reactors. These results show that
spatially integrated (i.e. integrated heat release or radical production rate
metrics averaged over the entire flame) chemical pathways are relatively
insensitive to turbulence intensity and mimic the behavior of stretched flames.
In other words, the contribution of a given reaction to heat release or radical
production, integrated over the entire flame, is nearly independent to
turbulence. Localized analysis conditioned on topological feature of the flame
and on temperature is also performed. The former analysis reveals that much
larger alteration of pathways occurs in the positively-curved regions of the
flame. The latter localized analysis shows that peak activity in the low
temperature (i.e. below 1200K) region shift towards higher temperatures with
increases in Karlovitz number. This result is particularly interesting given
that prior work with lighter fuels showed the opposite behavior suggesting a
disparate response of the reactions involved in the fuel oxidation process to
increased turbulence.

approximation (R(Q)TBA) has successfully provided a good description of the
low-energy strength, in particular, the strength associated with pygmy dipole
resonance, describing transitions from and to the nuclear ground state. The
finite-temperature generalization of this method is designed for thermally
excited compound nuclei and has the potential to enrich the fine structure of
the dipole strength, especially in the low-energy region. The
finite-temperature RTBA equations are derived using the Matsubara Green's
function formalism. We show that with the help of a temperature-dependent
projection operator on the subspace of the imaginary time it is possible to
reduce the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the nuclear response function to a
single frequency variable equation also at finite temperatures. The approach is
implemented self-consistently in the framework of quantum hadrodynamics and
keeps the ability of connecting the high-energy scale of heavy mesons and the
low-energy domain of nuclear medium polarization effects in a parameter-free
way. The presented calculations of the dipole response within a self-consistent
relativistic framework reveal that, although the Landau damping plays the
leading role in the temperature evolution of the strength distribution, (i) at
moderate temperatures the PVC effects remain almost as strong as at $T=0$ and
(ii) at high temperatures they are tremendously reinforced because of the
formation of the new collective low-energy modes. In the dipole channel, the
latter effect is responsible for the ""disappearance"" of the high-frequency GDR

amplitude, presence of characteristic timescales, bluer-when-brighter
achromatic behavior, and single power-law power spectral density. In {\it

found similar features consistent with the optical studies. In addition, in BL

we find that the low flux state exhibit more rapid variability in contrast to
the previously reported results showing high flux states displaying rapid
variability. In both the studies, the size of the emission regions estimated
using variability timescales turn out to be an order magnitude smaller than the
gravitational radius of a typical black-hole masses between $\sim 10^8-10^9$

and a low ionization timescale of $n_{e}t < 2.95 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$s.
The northern knot located in the halo is best fitted with a two-component
power-law + non-equilibrium ionization thermal model characterized by a
temperature of 0.14 keV and an enhanced abundance of silicon, confirming its
nature as ejecta. We revisit the spatially resolved spectral study of the PWN
and find that its radial spectral profile can be explained by diffusion models.
The best fit diffusion coefficient is $D \sim 2.1\times 10^{27}\rm cm^2/s$
assuming a magnetic field $B =130 \mu G$, which is consistent with recent 3D
MHD simulation results.

the process is conservative, or whether substantial mass is lost from the

photospheric chemical composition, in particular in the carbon-to-nitrogen

the components of a classical Algol-type system, $\delta$ Librae. The present
analysis is based on new spectroscopic data (ground-based high-resolution
\'echelle spectra) and extracted archival photometric observations (space-based
measurements from the STEREO satellites). In the orbital solution,
non-Keplerian effects on the radial-velocity variations were taken into
account. This reduces the primary's mass by 1.1 \Msun\ ($\sim$23\%)
significantly in comparison to previous studies, and removes a long-standing
discrepancy between the radius and effective temperature. A spectral
disentangling technique is applied to the \'echelle observations and the
spectra of the individual components are separated. Atmospheric and abundance
analyses are performed for the mass-gaining component and we found C/N $= 1.55
\pm 0.40$ for this star. An extensive set of evolutionary models
($3.5\times10^6$) for both components are calculated from which the
best-fitting model is derived. It is found that $\beta$, the parameter which
quantifies the efficiency of mass-loss from a binary system, is close to zero.
This means that the mass-transfer in $\delta$ Lib is mostly conservative with
little mass loss from the system.

noise and therefore increased sensitivity, enabling improved constraints on
fundamental physics parameters such as the sum of neutrino masses and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio r. Achieving competitive constraints on these parameters
requires high signal-to-noise extraction of the projected gravitational
potential from the CMB maps. Standard methods for reconstructing the lensing
potential employ the quadratic estimator (QE). However, the QE performs
suboptimally at the low noise levels expected in upcoming experiments. Other
methods, like maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), are under active
development. In this work, we demonstrate reconstruction of the CMB lensing
potential with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) - ie, a ResUNet. The
network is trained and tested on simulated data, and otherwise has no physical
parametrization related to the physical processes of the CMB and gravitational
lensing. We show that, over a wide range of angular scales, ResUNets recover
the input gravitational potential with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the
QE method, reaching levels comparable to analytic approximations of MLE
methods. We demonstrate that the network outputs quantifiably different lensing
maps when given input CMB maps generated with different cosmologies. We also
show we can use the reconstructed lensing map for cosmological parameter
estimation. This application of CNN provides a few innovations at the
intersection of cosmology and machine learning. First, while training and
regressing on images, we predict a continuous-variable field rather than
discrete classes. Second, we are able to establish uncertainty measures for the
network output that are analogous to standard methods. We expect this approach
to excel in capturing hard-to-model non-Gaussian astrophysical foreground and
noise contributions.

investigated by using the frozen coupling constant approach for various kaon
distribution amplitudes (DAs), which are predicted by light-cone formalism, the
light-front quark model, the nonlocal chiral quark model and the light-front
holographic AdS/CFT approach. In the numerics the dependencies of the HT
contribution on the transverse momentum $p_T$, the rapidity $y$, and the

HT contributions are dependent on the kaon DAs and also some other
phenomenological parameters such as momentum cut-off parameter $\Delta p$.
Inclusive kaon pair production presents a remarkable test case in which HT
terms dominate those of LT in certain kinematic regions. The HT direct

not all of the bulge-dominated galaxies are quenched. We found that
bulge-dominated galaxies show positive correlations among the D4000 strength,
stellar mass, and the S\'ersic index, while late-type disks do not show such
strong positive correlations. Also, bulge-dominated galaxies are clearly
separated into two main groups in the parameter space of sSFR vs. stellar mass
and stellar surface density within the effective radius, $\Sigma_{\rm e}$,
while late-type disks and irregulars only show high sSFR. This split is
directly linked to the `blue cloud' and the `red sequence' populations, and
correlates with the associated central compactness indicated by $\Sigma_{\rm
e}$. While star-forming massive late-type disks and irregulars (with D4000 $<$
1.5 and log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) \gtrsim 10.5$) span a stellar mass range
comparable to bulge-dominated galaxies, most have systematically lower

processing, sensing, and other applications. A possibility of using the
amplitude and phase of magnons for sending signals via electrical insulators
creates conditions for avoiding Ohmic losses, and achieving ultra-low power
dissipation. Most of the envisioned magnonic logic devices are based on spin
wave interference, where the minimum energy per operation is limited by the
noise level. The sensitivity and selectivity of magnonic sensors is also
limited by the low frequency noise. However, the fundamental question ""do
magnons make noise?"" has not been answered yet. It is not known how noisy
magnonic devices are compared to their electronic counterparts. Here we show
that the low-frequency noise of magnonic devices is dominated by the random
telegraph signal noise rather than 1/f noise - a striking contrast to
electronic devices (f is a frequency). We found that the noise level of surface
magnons depends strongly on the power level, increasing sharply at the on-set
of nonlinear dissipation. The presence of the random telegraph signal noise
indicates that the current fluctuations involve random discrete macro events.
We anticipate that our results will help in developing the next generation of

done with a simple top-down recursive partitioning algorithm, starting with a
single community and separating the nodes into two communities by spectral
clustering repeatedly, until a stopping rule suggests there are no further

and requires no tuning other than selecting a stopping rule. We show that there
are regimes where this approach outperforms K-way spectral clustering, and
propose a natural framework for analyzing the algorithm's theoretical
performance, the binary tree stochastic block model. Under this model, we prove
that the algorithm correctly recovers the entire community tree under
relatively mild assumptions. We apply the algorithm to a gene network based on

devices exploiting these materials. Here we propose that the room temperature
ferromagnet Fe3Sn2, whose fundamental building blocks are Kagome bilayers of
iron, hosts Weyl nodes at the Fermi level which can move in momentum space
depending on the direction of the magnetization, itself readily controlled
either by modest external fields or temperature. The proposal is derived from
density functional calculations, including a mean field treatment of Hubbard
repulsion U, which have been validated by comparison with angle-resolved
photoemission data. Ferromagnetism with magnetization along certain directions
is shown to lift the Weyl degeneracies, while at the same time inducing texture
in the quasiparticle spin polarizations mapped in reciprocal space. In
particular, the polarization is attenuated and then rotated from parallel to
perpendicular to antiparallel to the magnetization as Weyl points derived from
crossing of majority and minority spin bands are traversed.

additional meta-data, the task was to recommend up to 500 tracks that fit the
target characteristics of the original playlist. For the RecSys Challenge,
Spotify released a dataset of one million user-generated playlists.
Participants could compete in two tracks, i.e., main and creative tracks.
Participants in the main track were only allowed to use the provided training
set, however, in the creative track, the use of external public sources was
permitted. In total, 113 teams submitted 1,228 runs to the main track; 33 teams
submitted 239 runs to the creative track. The highest performing team in the
main track achieved an R-precision of 0.2241, an NDCG of 0.3946, and an average

  Systems",,"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 2019",,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive MIMO requires a large number of antennas and the same amount of power
amplifiers (PAs), one per antenna. As opposed to 4G base stations, which could
afford highly linear PAs, next-generation base stations will need to use
inexpensive PAs, which have a limited region of linear amplification. One of
the research challenges is effectively handling signals which have high
peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs), such as orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM). This paper introduces a PAPR-aware precoding scheme that
exploits the excessive spatial degrees-of-freedom of large scale multiple-input
multipleoutput (MIMO) antenna systems. This typically requires finding a
solution to a nonconvex optimization problem. Instead of relaxing the problem
to minimize the peak power, we introduce a practical semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) framework that enables accurately and efficiently approximating the
theoretical PAPR-aware precoding performance for OFDM-based massive MIMO
systems. The framework allows incorporating channel uncertainties and intercell
coordination. Numerical results show that several orders of magnitude
improvements can be achieved w.r.t. state of the art techniques, such as
instantaneous power consumption reduction and multiuser interference
cancellation. The proposed PAPRaware precoding can be effectively handled along
with the multicell signal processing by the centralized baseband processing
platforms of next-generation radio access networks. Performance can be traded

models. Currently, our understanding of the GSS, in terms of both its geometry
and its chemistry, results from either wide-field imaging probing only a few
magnitudes below the red giant branch tip, or deep imaging or spectroscopy of
isolated regions. Here, we take an alternative approach, using Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) imaging to characterize the horizontal branch red clump (RC)
using unbinned maximum likelihood fits to luminosity functions (LFs) from
observed color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Comparing the RC mean magnitude
across three fields at projected distances of 21, 52 and 80 kpc from M31, we
find a line of sight distance gradient identical to recent literature
measurements in fields along the core. We also find tentative evidence that the
line of sight distance dispersion increases with projected distance from M31.
Meanwhile, the metallicity in the 52 kpc field westward of the GSS core is at
least as high as that in the 21 kpc GSS core field, and the peak colors of the
RC in these two fields imply identical metallicities to within 0.2 dex. We
discuss implications for distance and metallicity gradients both along and
perpendicular to the GSS in the context of recent ground-based photometric and
spectroscopic results, including evidence for a dropoff in metallicity moving
westward from the GSS, as well as prospects for further constraining stellar
populations in the vicinity of the GSS.

a Neural Network (NN) to predict the right band assignment decision using

process of merging noisy databases in the absence of unique identifiers to
remove duplicate entities. One major challenge of analysis with linked data is
identifying a representative record among determined matches to pass to an
inferential or predictive task, referred to as the \emph{downstream task}.
Additionally, incorporating uncertainty from ER in the downstream task is
critical to ensure proper inference. To bridge the gap between ER and the
downstream task in an analysis pipeline, we propose five methods to choose a
representative (or canonical) record from linked data, referred to as
canonicalization. Our methods are scalable in the number of records,
appropriate in general data scenarios, and provide natural error propagation
via a Bayesian canonicalization stage. The proposed methodology is evaluated on
three simulated data sets and one application -- determining the relationship
between demographic information and party affiliation in voter registration
data from the North Carolina State Board of Elections. We first perform
Bayesian ER and evaluate our proposed methods for canonicalization before
considering the downstream tasks of linear and logistic regression. Bayesian
canonicalization methods are empirically shown to improve downstream inference
in both settings through prediction and coverage.

automate this workflow, especially in the matching of models with inference

matching: its structure---the conditional dependencies between random
variables---and its form---the precise mathematical definition of those
dependencies. While the structure and form of a probabilistic model are often
fixed a priori, it is a curiosity of probabilistic programming that they need
not be, and may instead vary according to random choices made during program
execution. We introduce a formal description of models expressed as programs,
and discuss some of the ways in which probabilistic programming languages can

graphical inference method - GI-OHMS (Graphical Inference in Observed-Hidden

a graphical inference method (Bayesian Markov Random Field) to extract
communities. The superiority of our approach lies in two main observations: 1)
The extracted OHMS network excludes many weaker connections, thus leading to a
higher accuracy of inference 2) The graphical inference step operates on a
smaller network, thus having much lower execution time. We demonstrate that our
method outperforms the accuracy of other baseline algorithms like OSLOM, DEMON,

about it, they will need to find new ways of entertainment. However, retrieving
entertainment contents at the Data Center (DC) can hinder content delivery
service due to high delay of car-to-DC communication. To address these
challenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, by
using Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing
(MEC) structure. First, at DC, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict
the probabilities of contents to be requested in specific areas. To reduce the
car-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into MEC servers attached to roadside
units. Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car
passengers' features such as age and gender, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
is used to predict age and gender of passengers. Third, each car requests MLP
output from MEC server and compares its CNN and MLP outputs by using k-means
and binary classification. Through this, the self-driving car can identify the
contents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached. Finally, we
formulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving car that enhances
entertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize
content downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a Block Successive
Majorization-Minimization (BS-MM) technique is applied. The simulation results
show that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached in
the areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach can
minimize delay.

designs, such as cohort reader-writer locks, use distributed reader indicators,

threads in an address space can share the visible readers table. Updates by
readers tend to be diffused over the table, resulting in a NUMA-friendly
design. Crucially, readers of the same lock tend to write to different

out the hydromagnetic waves model as the only one that can account for the
observed properties of striations. Based on the predictions of that model, we

knowledge in a clinically efficient manner and to offer a reliable resolution
with the acquired knowledge. The knowledge base to be used by a medical expert
system should allow incremental growth with inclusion of updated knowledge over
the time. As knowledge are gathered from a variety of knowledge sources by
different knowledge engineers, the problem of redundancy is an important
concern here due to increased processing time of knowledge and occupancy of
large computational storage to accommodate all the gathered knowledge. Also
there may exist many inconsistent knowledge in the knowledge base. In this
paper, we have proposed a rough set based lattice structure for knowledge
representation in medical expert systems which overcomes the problem of
redundancy and inconsistency in knowledge and offers computational efficiency
with respect to both time and space. We have also generated an optimal set of
decision rules that would be used directly by the inference engine. The
reliability of each rule has been measured using a new metric called
credibility factor, and the certainty and coverage factors of a decision rule
have been re-defined. With a set of decisions rules arranged in descending
order according to their reliability measures, the medical expert system will
consider the highly reliable and certain rules at first, then it would search
for the possible and uncertain rules at later stage, if recommended by
physicians. The proposed knowledge representation technique has been
illustrated using an example from the domain of low back pain. The proposed
scheme ensures completeness, consistency, integrity, non-redundancy, and ease
of access.

B atoms in the lattice, an effect referred to as disproportionation,
distinguishing such compounds from perovskites that have single local
environments (SLE). The basic phenomenology of disproportionation involves the
absence of B-atom charge ordering, the creation of different B-X bond length
for different local environments, the appearance of metal (in SLE) to insulator
(in DLE) transition, and the formation of ligand holes. We point out that this
phenomenology is common to a broad range of chemical bonding patterns in ABX3
compounds, either with s-p electron B-metal cations (BaBiO3, CsTlF3), or noble
metal cation (CsAuCl3), as well as d-electron cations (SmNiO3, CaFeO3). We show
that underlying much of this phenomenology is the self-regulating response,
whereby in strongly bonded metal-ligand systems with high lying ligand
orbitals, the system protects itself from creating highly charged cations by
transferring ligand electrons to the metal, thus preserving a nearly constant
metal charge in DLE, while creating B-ligand bond alternation and ligand-like
conduction band (ligand hole). We are asking what are the minimal theory
ingredients needed to explain the main features of this SLE-to-DLE
phenomenology, such as its energetic driving force, bond length changes,
possible modifications in charge density and density of state changes. Using as
a guide the lowering of the total energy in DLE relative to SLE, we show that
density functional calculations describe this phenomenology across the whole
chemical bonding range without resort to special strong correlation effects,
beyond what DFT naturally contains. In particular, lower total energy
configurations (DLE) naturally develop bond alternation, gaping of the metallic
SLE state, and absence of charge ordering with ligand hole formation.

entanglement encoded in a pair of spin 1/2 particles described via Dirac
bispinors. Due to the intrinsic parity-spin internal structure of the
bispinors, the joint state is a four-qubit state exhibiting multipartite
entanglement, and to compute global correlation properties we consider the
averaged negativities over each possible bi-partition. We also consider
specific bipartitions, such as the spin-spin and the particle-particle
bipartitions. The particle-particle entanglement, between all degrees of
freedom of one particle and all degrees of freedom of the other particle, is
invariant under boosts if each particle has a definite momentum, although the
spin-spin entanglement is degraded for high speed boosts. Correspondingly, the
mean negativities are not invariant since the boost drives changes into
correlations encoded in specific bipartitions. Finally, the results presented
in the literature about spin-momentum entanglement are recovered by considering
the projection of bispinorial states into positive intrinsic parity, and some
striking differences between the appropriate approach for this case and the one
usually treated in the literature are discussed.

Poissonian spectrum the density of the ratio is flat, whereas for the three
Gaussian ensembles repulsion at small values is found. The ordered spacing
statistics and their ratio are numerically studied for the integrable circle
billiard, the chaotic cardioid billiard, the standard map and the zeroes of the
Riemann zeta function. Very good agreement with the predictions is found.

obliviously manage and evaluate firewalls to prevent both insider and external

distributing the function of evaluating these rules across multiple servers.
Thus, both accessing and altering the rules are considerably more difficult

security for the firewall itself. We achieve this by integrating multiple areas
of research such as secret sharing schemes and multi-party computation, as well
as Bloom filters and Byzantine agreement protocols. Our resulting solution is
an efficient and secure means by which a firewall may be distributed, and
obfuscated while maintaining the ability for multiple servers to obliviously

atomically fetch-and-increment ticket and then wait for grant to become equal

grant. This simple design has short code paths and fast handover (transfer of
ownership) under light contention, but may suffer degraded scalability under
high contention when multiple threads busy wait on the grant field -- so-called
global spinning. We propose a variation on ticket locks where long-term waiting
threads wait on locations in a waiting array instead of busy waiting on the

waiting is accomplished in the usual manner on the grant field. The resulting
algorithm, TWA, improves on ticket locks by limiting the number of threads
spinning on the grant field at any given time, reducing the number of remote
caches requiring invalidation from the store that releases the lock. In turn,
this accelerates handover, and since the lock is held throughout the handover
operation, scalability improves. Under light or no contention, TWA yields
performance comparable to the classic ticket lock, avoiding the complexity and
extra accesses incurred by MCS locks in the handover path, but providing
performance above or beyond that of MCS at high contention.

parameters of the unsafe set and probabilistic states of the robot. To solve
this problem, we use a moment-based representation of probability

distributions, risk can be estimated in real-time. We demonstrate the

when the coarse grid size is much larger than the fine grid size. Thus,
multilevel methods are desirable for problems with complex heterogeneities and
high contrast. In this paper, we propose a novel three-level upscaling method
for flow problems in fractured porous media. Our method starts with a fine grid
discretization for the system involving fractured porous media. In the next
step, based on the fine grid model, we construct a nonlocal multi-continua
upscaling (NLMC) method using an intermediate grid. The system resulting from
NLMC gives solutions that have physical meaning. In order to enhance locality,
the grid size of the intermediate grid needs to be relatively small, and this
motivates using such an intermediate grid. However, the resulting NLMC upscaled
system has a relatively large dimension. This motivates a further step of
dimension reduction. In particular, we will apply the idea of the Generalized
Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) to the NLMC system to obtain a final
reduced model. We present simulation results for a two-dimensional model
problem with a large number of fractures using the proposed three-level method.

the most important tasks in the machine learning field, especially with layered
neural networks, which have achieved high predictive performance with various
practical data sets. To reveal the global structure of a trained neural network
in an interpretable way, a series of clustering methods have been proposed,
which decompose the units into clusters according to the similarity of their
inference roles. The main problems in these studies were that (1) we have no
prior knowledge about the optimal resolution for the decomposition, or the
appropriate number of clusters, and (2) there was no method with which to
acquire knowledge about whether the outputs of each cluster have a positive or
negative correlation with the input and output dimension values. In this paper,
to solve these problems, we propose a method for obtaining a hierarchical

by SDO/AIA and HMI, while the CME kinematics during the impulsive acceleration
phase is studied close to the limb with STEREO/EUVI and COR, minimizing
projection effects. The dimming area, its total unsigned magnetic flux and its
total brightness, reflecting properties of the total dimming region at its
final extent, show the highest correlations with the CME mass ($c\sim0.6-0.7$).
Their corresponding time derivatives, describing the dynamics of the dimming
evolution, show the strongest correlations with the CME peak velocity ($c\sim
0.6$). The highest correlation of $c=0.68\pm0.08$ is found with the mean
intensity of dimmings, indicating that the lower the CME starts in the corona,
the faster it propagates. No significant correlation between dimming parameters
and the CME acceleration was found. However, for events where high-cadence
STEREO observations were available, the mean unsigned magnetic field density in
the dimming regions tends to be positively correlated with the CME peak
acceleration ($c=0.42\pm0.20$). This suggests that stronger magnetic fields
result in higher Lorentz forces providing stronger driving force for the CME
acceleration. Specific coronal dimming parameters correlate with both, CME and
flare quantities providing further evidence for the flare-CME feedback
relationship. For events in which the CME occurs together with a flare, coronal
dimmings statistically reflect the properties of both phenomena.

continuum emission (850um) at a spatial resolution of 0.3"" reveal two compact
(r_1/2 ~ 1 kpc) and interacting molecular gas disks at a separation of 8.6 kpc
thus indicative of an early stage in a merger. With a SFR of 991 Msun/yr, this
starburst event should occur closer to final coalescence, as usually seen in
hydrodynamical simulations. From the CO size, inclination, and velocity profile
for both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that
incorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers. Based on the
dynamical mass, we measure (1) the molecular gas mass, independent from the CO
luminosity, (2) the ratio of the total gas mass and the CO(1 - 0) luminosity
(alpha_CO = M_gas/L'_CO(1-0)), and (3) the gas-to-dust ratio, with the latter
two being lower than typically assumed. We find that the high star formation,
triggered in both galaxies, is caused by a set of optimal conditions: a high
gas mass/fraction, a short depletion time (t_depl=85 and 67 Myrs) to convert
gas into stars, and the interaction of likely counter-rotating molecular disks
that may accelerate the loss of angular momentum. The state of interaction is
further established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission,
tidal debris that bridges the two nuclei and is associated with stellar
emission seen by HST/WFC3. This observation demonstrates the power of ALMA to
study the dynamics of galaxy mergers at high redshift.

molecular gas mass to L'_CO(1-0)), we convert the observational quantities

depletion time or its inverse, the star formation efficiency. We interpret the
results as indicative of the star formation efficiency increasing in a
continuous fashion from the MS to the starburst regime, whereas the gas
fractions remain comparable to those of MS galaxies. Although, the balance

non-perturbative numerical renormalization group reference data. We also
examine how well the low energy properties of the electron-boson coupled
systems can be reproduced by an effective static electron-electron interaction.
The one-crossing and slave-rotor approximations are then used to simulate
insulator-to-metal transitions induced by a sudden switch-on of the
electron-phonon interaction. The slave-rotor results suggest the existence of a
critical electron-phonon coupling above which the system is transiently trapped
in a non-thermal metallic state with coherent quasiparticles. The same quench
protocol in the one-crossing approximation results in a bad metallic state.

RANSAC, which however often fit inferior models in practice with noisy inputs

and benefiting from the recent advancements in image semantic segmentation

this problem. Firstly, through a fully convolutional neural network, the input
point cloud is point-wisely segmented into multiple classes divided by jointly
detected instance boundaries without any geometric fitting. Thus, segments can
serve as primitive hypotheses with a probability estimation of associating
primitive classes. Finally, all hypotheses are sent through a geometric
verification to correct any misclassification by fitting primitives

sharp transition in the dynamics and enables stronger wavepacket spreading.
This transition is distinct from other flatband networks, where continuous
spreading is induced by effective nonlinear hopping or resonances with
delocalized modes, and is in contrast to the quantum limit, where two-particle
hopping enables arbitrarily large spreading. This nonlinear symmetry breaking
transition is readily observable in femtosecond laser-written waveguide arrays.

computer vision literature. Almost every computer vision model trained on
imaging data uses some form of augmentation. In this paper, we use the
inter-vertebral disk segmentation task alongside a deep residual U-Net as the
learning model, to explore the effectiveness of augmentation. In the extreme,
we observed that a model trained on patches extracted from just one scan, with
each patch augmented 50 times; achieved a Dice score of 0.73 in a validation
set of 40 cases. Qualitative evaluation indicated a clinically usable
segmentation algorithm, which appropriately segments regions of interest,
alongside limited false positive specks. When the initial patches are extracted
from nine scans the average Dice coefficient jumps to 0.86 and most of the
false positives disappear. While this still falls short of state-of-the-art
deep learning based segmentation of discs reported in literature, qualitative
examination reveals that it does yield segmentation, which can be amended by
expert clinicians with minimal effort to generate additional data for training
improved deep models. Extreme augmentation of training data, should thus be
construed as a strategy for training deep learning based algorithms, when very
little manually annotated data is available to work with. Models trained with
extreme augmentation can then be used to accelerate the generation of manually
labelled data. Hence, we show that extreme augmentation can be a valuable tool
in addressing scaling up small imaging data sets to address medical image
segmentation tasks.

galaxies. Aims. We constrain the $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$ parameters
from a stand-alone sample of X-ray clusters detected in the 50 deg$^2$ XMM-XXL
survey with a well-defined selection function. Methods. We analyse the redshift
distribution of a sample comprising 178 high S/N clusters out to a redshift of
unity. The cluster sample scaling relations are determined in a self-consistent
manner. Results. In a lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the
cosmology favoured by the XXL clusters compares well with results derived from
the Planck S-Z clusters for a totally different sample (mass/redshift range,
selection biases, and scaling relations). However, with this preliminary sample
and current mass calibration uncertainty, we find no inconsistency with the
Planck CMB cosmology. If we relax the $w$ parameter, the Planck CMB
uncertainties increase by a factor of $\sim$10 and become comparable with those
from XXL clusters. Combining the two probes allows us to put constraints on
$\Omega_m$=0.316$\pm$0.060, $\sigma_8$=0.814$\pm$0.054, and $w$=-1.02$\pm$0.20.
Conclusions. This first self-consistent cosmological analysis of a sample of
serendipitous XMM clusters already provides interesting insights into the
constraining power of the XXL survey. Subsequent analysis will use a larger
sample extending to lower confidence detections and include additional
observable information, potentially improving posterior uncertainties by
roughly a factor of 3.

capacity of mobile backhaul networks can be significantly increased. On the
other hand, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides an appropriate infrastructure
to offload latency-sensitive tasks. However, the amount of resources in MEC
servers is typically limited. Therefore, it is important to intelligently
manage the MEC task offloading by optimizing the backhaul bandwidth and edge
server resource allocation in order to decrease the overall latency of the
offloaded tasks. This paper investigates the task allocation problem in MEC
environment, where the mmWave technology is used in the backhaul network. We
formulate a Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) problem with the goal
to minimize the total task serving time. Its objective is to determine an
optimized network topology, identify which server is used to process a given
offloaded task, find the path of each user task, and determine the allocated
bandwidth to each task on mmWave backhaul links. Because the problem is
difficult to solve, we develop a two-step approach. First, a Mixed Integer
Linear Program (MILP) determining the network topology and the routing paths is
optimally solved. Then, the fractions of bandwidth allocated to each user task
are optimized by solving a quasi-convex problem. Numerical results illustrate
the obtained topology and routing paths for selected scenarios and show that
optimizing the bandwidth allocation significantly improves the total serving
time, particularly for bandwidth-intensive tasks.

ferroelectric-like distortion. One puzzling experimental fact is its
paramagnetic state down to very low temperature with negligible magnetic
moment, which is anomalous considering its $5d^3$ electron configuration since
other osmium oxides (e.g. NaOsO$_3$) with $5d^3$ Os ions are magnetic. Here the
magnetic and electronic properties of LiOsO$_3$ are re-investigated carefully
using the first-principles density functional theory. Our calculations reveal
that the magnetic state of LiOsO$_3$ can be completely suppressed by the
spin-orbit coupling. The subtle balance between significant spin-orbit coupling
and weak Hubbard $U$ of $5d$ electrons can explain both the nonmagnetic
LiOsO$_3$ and magnetic NaOsO$_3$. Our work provides a reasonable understanding
of the long-standing puzzle of magnetism in some osmium oxides.

galaxies at high redshifts (z$\geq$1). Most measurements rely on CO as a
tracer, but dependences on metallicity, dynamics and surface density lead to
systematic uncertainties in high-z galaxies, where these physical properties
are difficult to observe, and where the physical environments can differ
systematically from those at z=0. Dust continuum emission provides a potential
alternative assuming a known dust/gas ratio, but this must be calibrated on a
direct gas tracer at z$\geq$1. In this paper we consider the [CI] 492-GHz
emission line, which has been shown to trace molecular gas closely throughout
Galactic clouds and has the advantages of being optically thin in typical
conditions (unlike CO), and being observable at accessible frequencies at high
redshifts (in contrast to the low-excitation lines of CO). We use the Atacama
Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) to measure [CI], CO(4-3) and dust
emission in a representative sample of star-forming galaxies at z=1, and
combine these data with multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions to study
relationships between dust and gas components of galaxies. We uncover a strong
[CI]-dust correlation, suggesting that both trace similar phases of the gas. By
incorporating other samples from the literature, we show that this correlation
persists over a wide range of luminosities and redshifts up to z$\sim$4.
Finally we explore the implications of our results as an independent test of
literature calibrations for dust as a tracer of gas mass, and for predicting
the CI abundance.

about the materials' pore structure and elastic properties. Therefore, such

measurements. However, it has been shown that results from many existing
inverse characterisation methods agree poorly. One reason is that inverse
methods are typically sensitive to even small uncertainties in a measurement
setup, but these uncertainties are difficult to model and hence often
neglected. In this paper, we study characterising poroelastic materials in the
Bayesian framework, where measurement uncertainties can be taken into account,
and which allows us to quantify uncertainty in the results. Using the finite
element method, we simulate measurements where ultrasonic waves are incident on
a water-saturated poroelastic material in normal and oblique angles. We
consider uncertainties in the incidence angle and level of measurement noise,
and then explore the solution of the Bayesian inverse problem, the posterior
density, with an adaptive parallel tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm. Results show that both the elastic and pore structure parameters can
be feasibly estimated from ultrasonic measurements.

Universe, super- massive black holes (SMBH) feed from gas flows spanning many
orders of magnitude, from the cosmic web in which they are embedded to their
event horizon. As such, accretion onto SMBHs constitutes a formidable challenge
to tackle numerically, and currently requires the use of sub-grid models to
handle the flow on small, unresolved scales. In this paper, we study the impact
of resolution on the accretion pattern of SMBHs initially inserted at the heart
of dense galactic gas clouds, using a custom super-Lagrangian refinement scheme
to resolve the black hole (BH) gravitational zone of influence. We find that
once the self-gravitating gas cloud host is sufficiently well re- solved,
accretion onto the BH is driven by the cloud internal structure, independently
of the BH seed mass, provided dynamical friction is present during the early
stages of cloud collapse. For a pristine gas mix of hydrogen and helium, a slim
disc develops around the BH on sub-parsec scales, turning the otherwise chaotic
BH accretion duty cycle into an episodic one, with potentially important
consequences for BH feedback. In the presence of such a nuclear disc, BH mass
growth predominantly occurs when infalling dense clumps trigger disc
instabilities, fuelling intense albeit short-lived gas accretion episodes.

recovering existing results in more specialized contexts. We show that the
applied voltage has a destabilizing effect on the bending instability of the

applied, changing the axial loading will influence the true electric field in

for distributed Bragg-reflector (DBR) pillars is proposed. The plane-wave
expansion is employed to represent the one-dimensional periodic structure of
the DBR. The cylindrical-wave expansion is employed to describe the scattering
by circular pillars with the DBR structure inside. This formalism enables us to
calculate the radiation fields, $t$-matrices, scattering cross sections,
photonic band structures, and quality factors of the DBR pillars. Furthermore,
optical properties of arrayed DBR pillars are also investigated with the aid of
the multiple-scattering method. Using this formalism, we demonstrate explicitly
that high $Q$ photonic band modes including the so-called bound states in
continuum are obtained both in isolated and arrayed DBR pillars. We also
present a novel formation of gapless Dirac-cone surface states in a
three-dimensional photonic crystal composed of a two-dimensional periodic
arrangement of core-shell DBR pillars.

billion smartcards, used in applications ranging from secure payments to
telecommunications. While the platform is a popular choice for established
commercial use cases (e.g., SIM cards in telecommunication networks), it has
notably low adoption rates in: 1) application scenarios requiring
recently-standardized cryptographic algorithms, 2) research projects, and 3)
open source initiatives. We attribute this to the restricted access to
low-level cryptographic primitives (e.g., elliptic curve operations) and the
lack of essential data types (e.g., Integers). While the underlying hardware
has those capabilities, the JavaCard API does not provide calls for the
corresponding functionality. Until now, the only available workaround was
manufacturer-specific proprietary APIs that come with very restrictive
non-disclosure agreements.
  In this paper, we introduce a methodology to efficiently derive essential
data types and low-level cryptographic primitives from high-level operations.
Our techniques are ideal for resource-constrained platforms, and make optimal
use of the underlying hardware, while having a small memory footprint. We also
introduce JCMathLib, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first generic
library for low-level cryptographic operations in JavaCards that does not rely
on a proprietary API. Without any disclosure limitations, JCMathLib enables
open code sharing, release of research prototypes and public and third-party
code audits.

treatment has been elusive. By combining Kuramoto's self-consistency approach,
Crawford's symmetry considerations, and exploiting the Ott-Antonsen ansatz

passes through a standing wave regime when the bimodal distribution is
compounded by two unimodal distributions with compact support. This is in
contrast to a possible transition across a region of bistability when the two
compounding unimodal distributions have infinite support.

--operating at separate timescales-- even if evidence reveals that rapid
evolutionary changes can feed back into ecological interactions. A recent
long-term field experiment has explicitly shown that communities of competing
plant species can experience very fast phenotypic diversification, and that
this gives rise to enhanced complementarity in resource exploitation and to
enlarged ecosystem-level productivity. Here, we build on progress made in
recent years in the integration of eco-evolutionary dynamics, and present a
computational approach aimed at describing these empirical findings in detail.
In particular we model a community of organisms of different but similar
species evolving in time through mechanisms of birth, competition, sexual
reproduction, descent with modification, and death. Based on simple rules, this
model provides a rationalization for the emergence of rapid phenotypic
diversification in species-rich communities. Furthermore, it also leads to
non-trivial predictions about long-term phenotypic change and ecological
interactions. Our results illustrate that the presence of highly specialized,
non-competing species leads to very stable communities and reveals that
phenotypically equivalent species occupying the same niche may emerge and
coexist for very long times. Thus, the framework presented here provides a
simple approach --complementing existing theories, but specifically devised to
account for the specificities of the recent empirical findings for plant
communities-- to explain the collective emergence of diversification at a
community level, and paves the way to further scrutinize the intimate
entanglement of ecological and evolutionary processes, especially in
species-rich communities.

linear combination of rules, where a rule is an indicator function defined over

difficult to consider all of them when fitting a sparse model. In this paper,
we propose Safe Optimal Rule Fit (SORF) as an approach to resolve this problem,
which is formulated as a convex optimization problem with sparse
regularization. The proposed SORF method utilizes the fact that the set of all
possible rules can be represented as a tree. By extending a recently
popularized convex optimization technique called safe screening, we develop a
novel method for pruning the tree such that pruned nodes are guaranteed to be
irrelevant to the prediction model. This approach allows us to efficiently
learn a prediction model constructed from an exponentially large number of all

numerical experiments using several benchmark datasets.

scaling properties of a wide class of $d$-dimensional geographically located

through $r_{ij}^ {-\alpha_A} \;(\alpha_A \geq 0)$. We have numerically analyzed
the time evolution of the connectivity of sites, the average shortest path, the
degree distribution entropy, and the average clustering coefficient, for
$d=1,2,3,4$, and typical values of $\alpha_A$. Remarkably enough, virtually all
the curves can be made to collapse as functions of the scaled variable
$\alpha_A/d$. These observations confirm the existence of three regimes. The
first one occurs in the interval $\alpha_A/d \in [0,1]$; it is non-Boltzmannian
with very-long-range interactions in the sense that the degree distribution is
a $q$-exponential with $q$ constant and above unity. The critical value
$\alpha_A/d =1$ that emerges in many of these properties is replaced by
$\alpha_A/d =1/2$ for the $\beta$-exponent which characterizes the time
evolution of the connectivity of sites. The second regime is still
non-Boltzmannian, now with moderately long-range interactions, and reflects in
an index $q$ monotonically decreasing with $\alpha_A/d$ increasing from its
critical value to a characteristic value $\alpha_A/d \simeq 5$. Finally, the
third regime is Boltzmannian (with $q=1$), and corresponds to short-range
interactions.

clarify the nature of the phases associated with the horn structures, we study
the phase diagram of the IA model with infinite-range F interactions by
applying a variational free energy in a cluster mean-field (CMF) approximation.
While the simple Bragg-Williams mean-field theory for each sublattice does not
produce a horn structure, we find such structures with the CMF method. This
confirms that the local thermal fluctuations enabled by the multisite clusters
are essential for this phenomenon. We investigate in detail the structure of
metastable phases in the phase diagram. In contrast to the phase diagram
obtained by the Monte Carlo studies, we find a triple point, at which
ferromagnetic-like, antiferromagnetic-like, and disordered phases coexist, and
also six tristable regions accompanying the horn structure. We also point out
that several characteristic endpoints of first-order transitions appear in the
phase diagram. We propose three possible scenarios for the transitions related
to the tristable regions. Finally, we discuss the relation between the triple
point in this phase diagram and that of a possible lattice-gas model, in which

between a disordered gas and a ferromagnetic dense phase at low enough energies
and large enough densities. The dynamics after a quench into the coexistence
region show that the order parameter associated to the liquid-vapour phase
separation follows an algebraic law with an unusual exponent, as it is forced
to synchronize with the growth of the magnetization: this suggests that for
finite size systems the magnetization sets in along a Curie line, which is also
the gas-side spinodal line, and that the coexistence region ends at a
tricritical point. This picture is confirmed at the mean-field level with
different approximation schemes, namely a Bethe lattice resolution and a virial
expansion complemented by the introduction of a self-consistent Weiss-like
molecular field. However, a detailed finite-size scaling analysis shows that in
two dimensions the ferromagnetic phase escapes the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario, and that the long-range order is not
destroyed by the unbinding of topological defects. The Curie line becomes thus
a magnetic crossover in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, the effects of the

follows: (i) it is not possible to ensure at the same time order-preserving

freshness; thus, reading data that is the most fresh without delay is possible
only in a weakly-isolated mode; (ii) to ensure atomic or order-preserving reads

finds 5d SYM for the zero modes. For the Kaluza-Klein modes one can likewise
find a Lagrangian description in 5d \cite{Bonetti:2012st}. Since in 5d we have
an ordinary YM gauge potential, one may look for a non-Abelian generalization

variations that we close on-shell. This way we get the fermionic equation of

indicating a binary central star. Comparison between the derived elemental

nucleosynthesis models indicates that the progenitor is a star with initial
mass of ~1.25 Msun and metallicity Z = 0.001/alpha-element/Cl-rich

consistent with the post-AGB evolution of 1.25 Msun initial mass stars with Z =
0.001. Using the photoionisation model, we fully reproduce the derived
quantities by adopting a cylindrically shaped nebula. We derive the mass
fraction of the C-atoms present in atomic gas, graphite grain, and C60. The
highest mass fraction of C60 (~0.19%) indicates that SaSt2-3 is the C60-richest

particularly where there is a strong shear flow. To obtain a comprehensive
understanding of these processes, it is necessary to study the complex dynamics
of shear regions. Due to current observational limitations, it is necessary to
investigate the inevitable small-scale dynamics via numerical calculations.
Here, we examine direct numerical calculations of a local model of unstable
shear flows in a compressible polytropic fluid primarily in a two-dimensional
domain, where we focus on determining how key parameters affect the global
properties and characteristics of the resulting saturated turbulent phase. We
consider the effect of varying both the viscosity and the thermal diffusivity
on the non-linear evolution. Moreover, our main focus is to understand the
global properties of the saturated phase, in particular estimating for the
first time the spread of the shear region from an initially hyperbolic tangent
velocity profile. We find that the vertical extent of the mixing region in the
saturated regime is generally determined by the initial Richardson number of
the system. Further, the characteristic quantities of the turbulence, i.e.
typical length-scale and the root-mean-square velocity are found to depend on
both the Richardson number, and the thermal diffusivity. Finally, we present
our findings of our investigation into saturated flows of a `secular' shear
instability in the low P\'eclet number regime with large Richardson numbers.

consider two QoI that measure the discrepancies between computed seismic
signals and given reference signals: one QoI, $\hbox{QoI}_E$, is defined in
terms of the $L^2$-misfit, which is directly related to maximum likelihood
estimates of the source parameters; the other, $\hbox{QoI}_W$, is based on the
quadratic Wasserstein distance between probability distributions, and
represents one possible choice in a class of such misfit functions that have
become increasingly popular to solve seismic inversion in recent years. We
simulate seismic wave propagation, including seismic attenuation, using a
publicly available code in widespread use, based on the spectral element
method. Using random coefficients and deterministic initial and boundary data,
we present benchmark numerical experiments with synthetic data in a
two-dimensional physical domain and a one-dimensional velocity model where the
assumed parameter uncertainty is motivated by realistic Earth models. Here, the
computational cost of the standard Monte Carlo method was reduced by up to 97%
for $\hbox{QoI}_E$, and up to 78% for $\hbox{QoI}_W$, using a relevant range of

further increase the relative computational work reduction.

the formation of relativistic ejections and their associated non-thermal
emission is the two-flow model, where the jets are supposed to be composed of
two different flows, a mildly relativistic baryonic jet surrounding a fast,
relativistically moving electron-positron plasma. Here we present the
simulation of the emission of such a structure taking into account the main
sources of photons that are present in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We
reproduce the broadband spectra of radio-loud AGNs with a detailed model of
emission taking into account synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission by a
relativistically moving beam of electron-positron, heated by a surrounding
turbulent baryonic jet. We compute the density and energy distribution of a
relativistic pair plasma all along a jet, taking into account the synchrotron
and inverse-Compton process on the various photon sources present in the core
of the AGN, as well as the pair creation and annihilation processes. We use
semi-analytical approximations to quickly compute the inverse-Compton process
on a thermal photon distribution with any anisotropic angular distribution. The
anisotropy of the photon field is also responsible for the bulk acceleration of
the pair plasma through the ""Compton rocket"" effect, thus imposing the plasma
velocity along the jet. As an example, the simulated emerging spectrum is
compared to the broadband emission of 3C273. In the case of 3C273, we obtain an

described by a single-pole Lorentz model for electronic polarization. We study
two classes of commonly used spatial discretizations: finite difference methods
(FD) with arbitrary even order accuracy in space and high spatial order
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods. Both types of spatial
discretizations are coupled with second order semi-implicit leap-frog and
implicit trapezoidal temporal schemes studied in our previous research [5,6].
By performing detailed dispersion analysis for the semi-discrete and fully
discrete schemes, we obtain rigorous quantification of the dispersion error for
Lorentz dispersive dielectrics. In particular, comparisons of dispersion error
can be made taking into account the model parameters, and mesh sizes in the
design of the two types of schemes. The results for the numerical dispersion
analysis can guide us in the optimal choice of discretization parameters for
the more complicated and nonlinear models. The numerical dispersion analysis of
the fully discrete FD and DG schemes, for the dispersive Maxwell model
considered in this paper, clearly indicate the dependence of the numerical
dispersion errors on spatial and temporal discretizations, their order of
accuracy, mesh discretization parameters and model parameters. The results
obtained here cannot be arrived at by considering discretizations of Maxwell's
equations in free space. In particular, our results contrast the advantages and
disadvantages of using high order FD or DG schemes and leap-frog or trapezoidal
time integrators over different frequency ranges using a variety of measures of
numerical dispersion errors. Finally, we highlight the limitations of the
second order accurate temporal discretizations considered.

electron-electron correlations or, equivalently, memory effects play a pivotal

To discover whether $e$ is active, it must be probed by paying the price

Firstly, the task mandates the recognition of an extremely high number of
different items, in the order of several thousands for medium-small shops, with
many of them featuring small inter and intra class variability. Then, available
product databases usually include just one or a few studio-quality images per
product (referred to herein as reference images), whilst at test time
recognition is performed on pictures displaying a portion of a shelf containing
several products and taken in the store by cheap cameras (referred to as query
images). Moreover, as the items on sale in a store as well as their appearance
change frequently over time, a practical recognition system should handle
seamlessly new products/packages. Inspired by recent advances in object
detection and image retrieval, we propose to leverage on state of the art
object detectors based on deep learning to obtain an initial productagnostic
item detection. Then, we pursue product recognition through a similarity search
between global descriptors computed on reference and cropped query images. To
maximize performance, we learn an ad-hoc global descriptor by a CNN trained on
reference images based on an image embedding loss. Our system is
computationally expensive at training time but can perform recognition rapidly
and accurately at test time.

of $G^r$ for some $r\ge 2$. We prove a zero-one law for the probability that
$G(q)$ is generated by a random $r$-tuple in $X(q) = X\cap G(q)^r$: the limit
of this probability as $q$ increases (through values of $q$ for which $X$ is
stable under the Frobenius morphism defining $G(q)$) is either 1 or 0. Indeed,
to ensure that this limit is 1, one only needs $G(q)$ to be generated by an
$r$-tuple in $X(q)$ for two sufficiently large values of $q$. We also prove a
version of this result where the underlying characteristic is allowed to vary.
  In our main application, we apply these results to the case where $r=2$ and
the irreducible subvariety $X = C\times D$, a product of two conjugacy classes
of elements of finite order in $G$. This leads to new results on random
$(2,3)$-generation of finite simple groups $G(q)$ of exceptional Lie type:
provided $G(q)$ is not a Suzuki group, we show that the probability that a
random involution and a random element of order 3 generate $G(q)$ tends to $1$
as $q \rightarrow \infty$. Combining this with previous results for classical
groups, this shows that finite simple groups (apart from Suzuki groups and
$PSp_4(q)$) are randomly $(2,3)$-generated.

of individual neurons and how they give rise to network dynamics when
interconnected. Historically, researchers have resorted to graph theory,
statistics, and statistical mechanics to describe the spatiotemporal structure
of such network dynamics. Our novel approach employs tools from algebraic
topology to characterize the global properties of network structure and
dynamics.
  We propose a method based on persistent homology to automatically classify
network dynamics using topological features of spaces built from various
spike-train distances. We investigate the efficacy of our method by simulating
activity in three small artificial neural networks with different sets of
parameters, giving rise to dynamics that can be classified into four regimes.
We then compute three measures of spike train similarity and use persistent
homology to extract topological features that are fundamentally different from
those used in traditional methods. Our results show that a machine learning
classifier trained on these features can accurately predict the regime of the
network it was trained on and also generalize to other networks that were not
presented during training. Moreover, we demonstrate that using features
extracted from multiple spike-train distances systematically improves the
performance of our method.

insulator and an ideal material to study tunneling phenomena, as it can be
easily integrated in vertical van der Waals devices. For spintronic devices,
its potential has been demonstrated both for efficient spin injection in
lateral spin valves and as a barrier in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here
we reveal the effect of point defects inevitably present in mechanically
exfoliated hBN on the tunnel magnetoresistance of Co-hBN-NiFe MTJs. We observe
a clear enhancement of both the conductance and magnetoresistance of the
junction at well-defined bias voltages, indicating resonant tunneling through
magnetic (spin-polarized) defect states. The spin polarization of the defect
states is attributed to exchange coupling of a paramagnetic impurity in the
few-atomic-layer thick hBN to the ferromagnetic electrodes. This is confirmed
by excellent agreement with theoretical modelling. Our findings should be taken
into account in analyzing tunneling processes in hBN-based magnetic devices.
More generally, our study shows the potential of using atomically thin hBN
barriers with defects to engineer the magnetoresistance of MTJs and to achieve
spin filtering, opening the door towards exploiting the spin degree of freedom

this work, we introduce Savoias, a visual complexity dataset that compromises
of more than 1,400 images from seven image categories relevant to the above
research areas, namely Scenes, Advertisements, Visualization and infographics,
Objects, Interior design, Art, and Suprematism. The images in each category
portray diverse characteristics including various low-level and high-level
features, objects, backgrounds, textures and patterns, text, and graphics. The
ground truth for Savoias is obtained by crowdsourcing more than 37,000 pairwise
comparisons of images using the forced-choice methodology and with more than
1,600 contributors. The resulting relative scores are then converted to
absolute visual complexity scores using the Bradley-Terry method and matrix
completion. When applying five state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze the
visual complexity of the images in the Savoias dataset, we found that the
scores obtained from these baseline tools only correlate well with crowdsourced
labels for abstract patterns in the Suprematism category (Pearson correlation
r=0.84). For the other categories, in particular, the objects and advertisement
categories, low correlation coefficients were revealed (r=0.3 and 0.56,
respectively). These findings suggest that (1) state-of-the-art approaches are
mostly insufficient and (2) Savoias enables category-specific method
development, which is likely to improve the impact of visual complexity

suppressing perturbations on small scales. Weak lensing data from galaxy
surveys probe the structure evolution and thereby can be used to constrain the
total mass of the three active neutrinos. However, much of the information is
at small scales where the dynamics are nonlinear. Traditional approaches with
second order statistics thus fail to fully extract the information in the
lensing field. In this paper, we study constraints on the neutrino mass sum
using lensing peak counts, a statistic which captures non-Gaussian information
beyond the second order. We use the ray-traced weak lensing mocks from the
Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations (MassiveNuS), and apply LSST-like
noise. We discuss the effects of redshift tomography, multipole cutoff
$\ell_{\rm max}$ for the power spectrum, smoothing scale for the peak counts,
and constraints from peaks of different heights. We find that combining peak
counts with the traditional lensing power spectrum can improve the constraint
on neutrino mass sum, $\Omega_m$, and $A_s$ by 39%, 32%, and 60%, respectively,
over that from the power spectrum alone.

keeps decreasing, while the O-H bond length increases up to the stable point

remarkable properties are different from those observed in most previous
researches which can be understood and extrapolated through classical

heavier than iron produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s process).
They belong to binary systems where the primary star evolved through the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase,during which it produced the s-process
elements and transferred them onto the secondary, now observed as a Ba star.
Aims. We compare the largest homogeneous set of Ba giant star observations of
the s-process elements Y, Zr, La, Ce, and Nd with AGB nucleosynthesis models to
reach a better understanding of the s process in AGB stars. Methods. By
considering the light-s (ls: Y and Zr) heavy-s (hs: La, Ce, and Nd) and
elements individually, we computed for the first time quantitative error bars
for the different hs-element/ls-element abundance ratios, and for each of the
sample stars. We compared these ratios to low-mass AGB nucleosynthesis models.
We excluded La from our analysis because the strong La lines in some of the
sample stars cause an overestimation and unreliable abundance determination, as
compared to the other observed hs-type elements. Results. All the computed
hs-type to ls-type element ratios show a clear trend of increasing with
decreasing metallicity with a small spread (less than a factor of 3). This
trend is predicted by low-mass AGB models where 13C is the main neutron source.
The comparison with rotating AGB models indicates the need for the presence of
an angular momentum transport mechanism that should not transport chemical
species, but significantly reduce the rotational speed of the core in the
advanced stellar evolutionary stages. This is an independent confirmation of
asteroseismology observations of the slow down of core rotation in giant stars,
and of rotational velocities of white dwarfs lower than predicted by models
without an extra angular momentum transport mechanism.

similar patches can be leveraged to extract generic fix actions. While the
literature includes various approaches leveraging similarity among patches to
guide program repair, these approaches often do not yield fix patterns that are
tractable and reusable as actionable input to APR systems. In this paper, we
propose a systematic and automated approach to mining relevant and actionable
fix patterns based on an iterative clustering strategy applied to atomic
changes within patches. The goal of FixMiner is thus to infer separate and
reusable fix patterns that can be leveraged in other patch generation systems.
Our technique, FixMiner, leverages Rich Edit Script which is a specialized tree
structure of the edit scripts that captures the AST-level context of the code
changes. FixMiner uses different tree representations of Rich Edit Scripts for
each round of clustering to identify similar changes. These are abstract syntax
trees, edit actions trees, and code context trees. We have evaluated FixMiner
on thousands of software patches collected from open source projects.
Preliminary results show that we are able to mine accurate patterns,
efficiently exploiting change information in Rich Edit Scripts. We further
integrated the mined patterns to an automated program repair prototype,
PARFixMiner, with which we are able to correctly fix 26 bugs of the Defects4J
benchmark. Beyond this quantitative performance, we show that the mined fix
patterns are sufficiently relevant to produce patches with a high probability
of correctness: 81% of PARFixMiner's generated plausible patches are correct.

assess and analyse the efficiency of the ACF in detecting planetary signals by
a detection of reflected light. To do so, we first compare the ACF and the CCF
using artificial spectra containing a planetary signal. We then use the ACF to
analyse spectra of the 51 Peg + 51 Peg b system and compare our results with
those obtained by Martins et al. (2015) who previously analysed the same system
using the CCF. The functionalities of the ACF and the way it is implemented are
similar to that of the CCF. One of the main advantages of the ACF is the fact
that, unlike the CCF, no weighted binary mask is required. This makes the ACF
easier to use. The results related to simulated spectra showed that the ACF
allowed us to decrease the boundary condition threshold for the use of spectra
compared to the CCF so that more data could be used to recover the planetary
signal. For the 51 Peg b planet, we achieved a detection significance of 5.52
{\sigma}noise with the ACF compared to 3.70 {\sigma}noise with the CCF (Martins

technique in detecting exoplanets considering its efficiency, ease of use and
rapid execution time.

the interspecies repulsion towards the strongly interacting regime the two

a phase separation on the two-body level that suggests the anti-ferromagnetic

that an intrawell fragmentation (filamentation) of the density occurs both for

result that is exclusively caused by the presence of strong correlations.

graviton in such subsystems, which can be taken to be the conformal class of
the induced metric in the boundary, subject to a constraint involving the
traceless part of the extrinsic curvature. We argue that this condition works
to discard local deformations of the boundary surface to infinitesimally nearby
extremal surfaces, that are otherwise available for generic codimension-2
extremal surfaces of dimension $\geq$ 2.

  (2019)",,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is generally accepted that linear theory of growth of structure under
gravity produces a squashed structure in the two-point correlation function
(2PCF) along the line of sight (LoS). On the other hand, the observed radial
spread out structure known as Finger of God (FoG) is attributed to non-linear
effects, like virial relaxation or random motions in the inner regions of
galaxy clusters, or non-linear terms in collapse theory. In this paper we argue
that the squashed structure associated with the redshift-space ($s-$) linear
theory 2PCF is obtained only when this function is displayed in real-space
($r-$), or when the mapping from $r-$ to $s-$space is trivialized by one of a
series of approximations: the ""wide separation"" sometimes mistaken by the
""distant observer"", the $\mu(r) \sim \mu(s)$ in the cosine of the position
vector with the LoS, or plainly by approximating $s \sim r$. To display the
$s-$space 2PCF properly in a grid in $s-$space requires one to solve for the
mapping function $\bm s(\bm r)$ and its inverse, which exists in the small
gravitational disturbance case. We find this mapping by using plane of the sky
projections of the $r-$ and $s-$ 2PCFs in the simplest case of the linear
Kaiser spectrum with a conservative power-law $r-$space 2PCF. We show that even
in this simple case, a structure quite similar to the FoG is observed in the
small scale region, while in the large scale the expected squashed structure is
obtained. We show that the observed structure is a function of three
parameters: the dimensionless growth rate for visible matter ($\beta$), the
power-law exponent ($\gamma$) and the cosmological distortion given by the
Alcock-Paczy{\'n}ski parameter ($AP$). We conclude that there appears to be the
way of discerning between cosmological and gravitational redshift distortions
avoiding known degeneracies.

potential customers, as the distribution of demand does not coincide with the
positions of vehicles at any given time. System operators often choose to
reposition these shared vehicles (such as bikes, cars, or scooters) actively
during the course of the day to improve service rate. They face a complex
dynamic optimization problem in which many integer-valued decisions must be
made, using real-time state and forecast information, and within the tight
computation time constraints inherent to real-time decision-making. We first
present a novel nested-flow formulation of the problem, and demonstrate that
its linear relaxation is significantly tighter than one from existing
literature. We then adapt a two-stage stochastic approximation scheme from the
generic SPAR algorithm due to Powell et al., in which rebalancing plans are
optimized against a value function representing the expected cost (in terms of
fulfilled and unfulfilled customer demand) of the future evolution of the
system. The true value function is approximated by a separable function of
contributions due to the rebalancing actions carried out at each station and
each time step of the planning horizon. The new algorithm requires surprisingly
few iterations to yield high-quality solutions, and is suited to real-time use
as it can be terminated early if required. We provide insight into this good
performance by examining the mathematical properties of our new flow
formulation, and perform rigorous tests on standardized benchmark networks to
explore the effect of system size. We then use data from Philadelphia's public
bike sharing scheme to demonstrate that the approach also yields performance
gains for real systems.

paper we look into the prerequisites for the emergence of simplified spatial
notions on the basis of a robot's sensorimotor flow. We show that the notion of
space as environment-independent cannot be deduced solely from exteroceptive
information, which is highly variable and is mainly determined by the contents
of the environment. The environment-independent definition of space can be
approached by looking into the functions that link the motor commands to
changes in exteroceptive inputs. In a sufficiently rich environment, the
kernels of these functions correspond uniquely to the spatial configuration of
the agent's exteroceptors. We simulate a redundant robotic arm with a retina
installed at its end-point and show how this agent can learn the configuration
space of its retina. The resulting manifold has the topology of the Cartesian
product of a plane and a circle, and corresponds to the planar position and
orientation of the retina.

What is the fewest number of coins you need to move to flip the triangle 180
degrees so that it points in the opposite direction? In the case of 4 rows, it
requires moving just 3 coins. The general solution for any number of rows can
be calculated by dividing the number of coins by 3 and ignoring any remainder.
A triangle of 4 rows has 10 coins, so 10/3 = 3.333 leads to 3 moves. However,
this calculation is fairly nonintuitive as to why it works and requires an
inelegant maneuver of periodically discarding a remainder. In this paper, we
present a more intuitive formula that always calculates the answer directly and

received considerable attention in recent years, especially in the X-ray
wavelength range. These features usually appear as a deficit or excess of
counts in a single resolution element of the detector, and as such they are
referred to as unresolved fluctuations. The general problem under investigation
is the probability of occurrence of chance fluctuations. A quantitative answer
is necessary to determine whether detected fluctuations are a real
(astronomical, in this case) signal, or if they can be attributed to chance.
This application note provides a new comprehensive method to answer this
question as function of the instrument's resolution, the wavelength coverage of
the spectrum, the number of fluctuations of interest, and the confidence level
chosen. The method is based on the binomial distribution, and addresses also
the probability of multiple simultaneous fluctuations. A critical aspect of the
model is the a priori knowledge of the location of possible fluctuations, which
significantly affects the probability of detection. In fact, a wider wavelength
range for the 'blind' search of possible fluctuations results in a larger
number of 'tries' for the detection of a fluctuation, lowering the overall
significance of a specific feature. The method is illustrated with a case study
and examples using X-ray data.

Poisson-Boltzmann solver \texttt{PyGBe}. Previous work from other researchers
coupled AMOEBA with the finite-difference solver APBS, and found difficulties
to effectively transfer the multipolar charge description to the mesh. A
boundary integral formulation treats the charge distribution analytically,
overlooking such limitations. We present verification and validation results of
our software, compare it with the implementation on APBS, and assess the
efficiency of AMOEBA and classical point-charge force fields in a
Poisson-Botlzmann solver. We found that a boundary integral approach performs
similarly to a volumetric method on CPU, however, it presents an important
speedup when ported to the GPU. Moreover, with a boundary element method, the
mesh density to correctly resolve the electrostatic potential is the same for
stardard point-charge and multipolar force fields. Finally, we saw that
polarizability plays an important role to consider cooperative effects, for
example, in binding energy calculations.

build traps for magnetic skyrmions. Magnetic defects have been modeled as local
variations in the material parameters, such as the exchange stiffness,
saturation magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya constant. We observe both pinning (potential well) and
scattering (potential barrier) traps when tuning either a local increase or a
local reduction for each one of these magnetic properties. It is found that the
skyrmion-defect aspect ratio is a crucial parameter to build traps for
skyrmions. In particular, the efficiency of the trap is compromised if the
defect size is smaller than the skyrmion size, because they interact weakly. On
the other hand, if the defect size is larger than the skyrmion diameter, the
skyrmion-defect interaction becomes evident. Thus, the strength of the
skyrmion-defect interaction can be tuned by the modification of the magnetic
properties within a region with suitable size. Furthermore, the basic physics
behind the mechanisms for pinning and for scattering is discussed. In
particular, we discover that skyrmions move towards the magnetic region which
tends to maximize its diameter; it enables the magnetic system to minimize its
energy. Thus, we are able to explain why skyrmions are either attracted or
repelled by a region with modified magnetic properties. Results here presented
are of utmost significance for the development and realization of future
spintronic devices, in which skyrmions will work as information carriers.

  Non-convolutional Networks","International Conference on Learning Representations 2019",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have
become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse
problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy
measurements. This success can be attributed in part to their ability to
represent and generate natural images well. Contrary to classical tools such as
wavelets, image-generating deep neural networks have a large number of
parameters---typically a multiple of their output dimension---and need to be
trained on large datasets. In this paper, we propose an untrained simple image
model, called the deep decoder, which is a deep neural network that can
generate natural images from very few weight parameters. The deep decoder has a
simple architecture with no convolutions and fewer weight parameters than the
output dimensionality. This underparameterization enables the deep decoder to
compress images into a concise set of network weights, which we show is on par
with wavelet-based thresholding. Further, underparameterization provides a
barrier to overfitting, allowing the deep decoder to have state-of-the-art
performance for denoising. The deep decoder is simple in the sense that each
layer has an identical structure that consists of only one upsampling unit,
pixel-wise linear combination of channels, ReLU activation, and channelwise
normalization. This simplicity makes the network amenable to theoretical
analysis, and it sheds light on the aspects of neural networks that enable them
to form effective signal representations.

  Modeling Tools: A Clinical Application","To Appear: ShapeMI Workshop: Workshop on Shape in Medical Imaging",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical shape modeling (SSM) has proven useful in many areas of biology
and medicine as a new generation of morphometric approaches for the
quantitative analysis of anatomical shapes. Recently, the increased
availability of high-resolution in vivo images of anatomy has led to the
development and distribution of open-source computational tools to model
anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented
detail and statistical power. Nonetheless, there is little work on the
evaluation and validation of such tools as related to clinical applications
that rely on morphometric quantifications for treatment planning. To address
this lack of validation, we systematically assess the outcome of widely used
off-the-shelf SSM tools, namely ShapeWorks, SPHARM-PDM, and Deformetrica, in
the context of designing closure devices for left atrium appendage (LAA) in
atrial fibrillation (AF) patients to prevent stroke, where an incomplete LAA
closure may be worse than no closure. This study is motivated by the potential
role of SSM in the geometric design of closure devices, which could be informed
by population-level statistics, and patient-specific device selection, which is
driven by anatomical measurements that could be automated by relating
patient-level anatomy to population-level morphometrics. Hence, understanding
the consequences of different SSM tools for the final analysis is critical for
the careful choice of the tool to be deployed in real clinical scenarios.
Results demonstrate that estimated measurements from ShapeWorks model are more
consistent compared to models from Deformetrica and SPHARM-PDM. Furthermore,
ShapeWorks and Deformetrica shape models capture clinically relevant
population-level variability compared to SPHARM-PDM models.

users communicate with a secondary gateway by backscattering or harvesting
energy and actively transmitting their data depending on the primary channel
state. To coordinate the transmission of multiple secondary transmitters, the
secondary gateway needs to schedule the backscattering time, energy harvesting
time, and transmission time among them. However, under the dynamics of the
primary channel and the uncertainty of the energy state of the secondary
transmitters, it is challenging for the gateway to find a time scheduling
mechanism which maximizes the total throughput. In this paper, we propose to
use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive an optimal time
scheduling policy for the gateway. Specifically, to deal with the problem with
large state and action spaces, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that
enables the gateway to learn the optimal policy. The simulation results clearly
show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms
non-learning schemes in terms of network throughput.
