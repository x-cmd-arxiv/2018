solving control decision problems in probabilistic reactive systems. We
consider parametric MDPs (pMDPs) that include parameters in some of the
transition probabilities to account for stochastic uncertainties of the
environment such as noise or input disturbances.
  We study pMDPs with reachability objectives where the parameter values are
unknown and impossible to measure directly during execution, but there is a
probability distribution known over the parameter values. We study for the
first time computing parameter-independent strategies that are expectation
optimal, i.e., optimize the expected reachability probability under the
probability distribution over the parameters. We present an encoding of our
problem to partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), i.e., a reduction of our problem
to computing optimal strategies in POMDPs.
  We evaluate our method experimentally on several benchmarks: a motivating
(repeated) learner model; a series of benchmarks of varying configurations of a
robot moving on a grid; and a consensus protocol.

  Trials",,,,,"econ.EM stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an adaptive randomization procedure for two-stage
randomized controlled trials. The method uses data from a first-wave experiment
in order to determine how to stratify in a second wave of the experiment, where
the objective is to minimize the variance of an estimator for the average
treatment effect (ATE). We consider selection from a class of stratified
randomization procedures which we call stratification trees: these are
procedures whose strata can be represented as decision trees, with differing
treatment assignment probabilities across strata. By using the first wave to
estimate a stratification tree, we simultaneously select which covariates to
use for stratification, how to stratify over these covariates, as well as the
assignment probabilities within these strata. Our main result shows that using
this randomization procedure with an appropriate estimator results in an
asymptotic variance which is minimal in the class of stratification trees.
Moreover, the results we present are able to accommodate a large class of
assignment mechanisms within strata, including stratified block randomization.
In a simulation study, we find that our method, paired with an appropriate
cross-validation procedure ,can improve on ad-hoc choices of stratification. We
conclude by applying our method to the study in Karlan and Wood (2017), where
we estimate stratification trees using the first wave of their experiment.

state and distribution of their interstellar gas. Observations indicate that
interactions funnel gas toward the nuclei, fueling bursts of star formation and
nuclear activity. To date, most numerical simulations of galaxy mergers have
assumed that the gaseous and stellar disks initially have the same distribution
and size. However, observations of isolated disk galaxies show that this is
seldom the case; in fact, most spirals have as much or more gas beyond their
optical radii as they do within. Can gas in such extended disks be efficiently
transported to the nuclei during interactions?
  To address this question, we examine the effect of various parameters on the
transport of gas to the nuclei of interacting galaxies. In addition to the
relative radii of the gaseous and stellar disks, these parameters include the
pericentric separation, disk orientation, fractional gas mass, presence of a
bulge, treatment of gas thermodynamics, and the spatial resolution of the
numerical simulation. We found that gas accumulates in most of our simulated
nuclei, but the efficiency of inflow is largely dependent upon the encounter
geometry. Dissipation alone is not enough to produce inflows; an efficient
mechanism for extracting angular momentum from the gas is necessary. Several
different mechanisms are seen in these experiments. Aside from mode-driven
inflows (such as, but not limited to, bars) and ram-pressure sweeping, both of
which have been previously described and well studied, we supply the first
quantitative study of an often-seen process: the formation of massive gas
clumps in Jeans-unstable tidal shocks, and their subsequent delivery to the
nuclei via dynamical friction.

they provide unique opportunities to calibrate stellar models and evaluate the
ages and coevality of the groups themselves. Low-mass M-dwarfs have pre-main
sequence life times on the order of $\sim100$ Myr and therefore are continually
evolving along a mass-luminosity track throughout the YMG phase, providing
ideal laboratories for precise isochronal dating, if a model-independent
dynamical mass can be measured. AstraLux lucky imaging multiplicity surveys
have recently identified hundreds of new YMG low-mass binaries, where a
subsample of M-dwarf multiples have estimated orbital periods less than 50
years. We have conducted a radial velocity survey of a sample of 29 such
targets to complement the astrometric data. This will allow enhanced orbital
determinations and precise dynamical masses to be derived in a shorter
timeframe than possible with astrometric monitoring alone, and allow for a more
reliable isochronal analysis. Here we present radial velocity measurements for
our sample over several epochs. We report the detection of the three-component
spectroscopic multiple 2MASS J05301858-5358483, for which the C component is a
new discovery, and forms a tight pair with the B component. Originally
identified as a YMG member, we find that this system is a likely old field
interloper, whose high chromospheric activity level is caused by tidal spin-up
of the tight BC pair. Two other triple systems with a tight pair exist in the
sample, but for the rest of the targets we find that additional tidally
synchronized companions are highly unlikely, providing further evidence that
their high chromospheric activity levels are generally signatures of youth.

games, require an agent to learn a continuous control. In the former, an agent
learns a policy over $\mathbb{R}^d$ and in the latter, over a discrete set of
actions each of which is parametrized by a continuous parameter. Such problems
are naturally solved using policy based reinforcement learning (RL) methods,
but unfortunately these often suffer from high variance leading to instability
and slow convergence. Unnecessary variance is introduced whenever policies over
bounded action spaces are modeled using distributions with unbounded support by
applying a transformation $T$ to the sampled action before execution in the
environment. Recently, the variance reduced clipped action policy gradient
(CAPG) was introduced for actions in bounded intervals, but to date no variance
reduced methods exist when the action is a direction, something often seen in
RTS games. To this end we introduce the angular policy gradient (APG), a
stochastic policy gradient method for directional control. With the marginal
policy gradients family of estimators we present a unified analysis of the
variance reduction properties of APG and CAPG; our results provide a stronger
guarantee than existing analyses for CAPG. Experimental results on a popular
RTS game and a navigation task show that the APG estimator offers a substantial
improvement over the standard policy gradient.

cluster-based graphical models, in which variable clustering is applied as an
initial step for reducing the dimension of the feature space. We employ model
assisted clustering, in which the clusters contain features that are similar to
the same unobserved latent variable. Two different cluster-based Gaussian
graphical models are considered: the latent variable graph, corresponding to
the graphical model associated with the unobserved latent variables, and the
cluster-average graph, corresponding to the vector of features averaged over
clusters. Our study reveals that likelihood based inference for the latent
graph, not analyzed previously, is analytically intractable. Our main
contribution is the development and analysis of alternative estimation and
inference strategies, for the precision matrix of an unobservable latent vector
$Z$. We replace the likelihood of the data by an appropriate class of empirical
risk functions, that can be specialized to the latent graphical model and to
the simpler, but under-analyzed, cluster-average graphical model. The
estimators thus derived can be used for inference on the graph structure, for
instance on edge strength or pattern recovery. Inference is based on the
asymptotic limits of the entry-wise estimates of the precision matrices
associated with the conditional independence graphs under consideration. While
taking the uncertainty induced by the clustering step into account, we
establish Berry-Esseen central limit theorems for the proposed estimators. It
is noteworthy that, although the clusters are estimated adaptively from the
data, the central limit theorems regarding the entries of the estimated graphs
are proved under the same conditions one would use if the clusters were
known....

while suffering from high leakage currents from a large number of transistors
in a large design. On the other hand, analog/mixed-signal neurons are prone to
noise, variability and mismatch, but can lead to extremely low-power designs.
In this work, we will analyze, compare and contrast existing neuron
architectures with a proposed mixed-signal neuron (MS-N) in terms of
performance, power and noise, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the
proposed mixed-signal neuron for achieving extreme energy-efficiency in
neuromorphic computing. The proposed MS-N is implemented in 65 nm CMOS

manufacturing non-idealities of the MS-N up to certain degrees. Notably, a
system-level implementation on MNIST datasets exhibits a worst-case increase in

IPWEs for MSMs with time-varying treatments of arbitrary (i.e., binary and
non-binary) distributions. Specifically, novel calibration restrictions are
derived by explicitly eliminating covariate associations with both the
treatment assignment process and the censoring process after weighting the
current sample (i.e., to optimise covariate balance in finite samples). A
convex minimization procedure is developed to implement the calibration.
Simulations show that IPWEs with calibrated weights perform better than IPWEs
with weights from maximum likelihood. We apply our method to a natural history
study of HIV for estimating the cumulative effect of highly active
antiretroviral therapy on CD4 cell counts over time.

However, for a particular family of polynomials, a curious phenomenon occurs:
the observed error is much smaller than the expected error bound. We examine

  PICOD Problem","Submitted to ITW 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pliable Index CODing (PICOD) is a variant of the Index Coding (IC) problem in
which a user is satisfied whenever it can successfully decode any one message
that is not in its side information set, as opposed to a fixed pre-determined
message. The complete--$S$ PICOD with $m$ messages, for $S\subseteq[0:m-1]$,
has $n = \sum_{s\in S} \binom{m}{s}$ users with distinct side information sets.
Past work on PICOD provided tight converse results when either the sender is
constrained to use linear codes, or for some special classes of complete--$S$
PICOD. This paper provides a tight information theoretic converse result (i.e.,
no restriction to linear codes) for the so-called ""consecutive complete--$S$""
PICOD, where the set $S$ satisfies $S=[s_{min} : s_{max}]$ for some $0\leq
s_{min} \leq s_{max} \leq m-1$. This result extends existing converse results
and shows that linear codes have the smallest possible code length given by
$\min(m-s_{\min},1+s_{\max})$. The central contribution is a novel proof
technique rooted in combinatorics. The main idea is to consider all the
messages a user can eventually successfully decode, in addition to its own
desired message. This allows us to circumvent the necessity of essentially
considering all possible assignments of desired messages for the users. The
keystone of the proof is to show that, for the case of $S=\{s\}$ and $m =
2s+1$, there exists at least one user who can decode $s+1$ messages. From this,
the extension to the ""consecutive complete--$S$"" PICOD follows.

these plasmas. The measurements were obtained using a sub-harmonic arc
detection (SHAD) system in the transmission lines of one of the ICRF antennas.
The measured ion cyclotron emission (ICE) spectra were strongly filtered by the
antenna system, and typically contained sub-structure, consisting of sets of
peaks with a separation of a few kHz, suggesting the excitation of
compressional Alfven eigenmodes (CAEs) closely spaced in frequency. In most
cases the energetic ions can be clearly identified as ICRF-accelerated He-3
minority ions, although in two pulses the emission may have been produced by
energetic He-4 ions, originating from third harmonic ICRF wave acceleration. It
is proposed that the emission close to the He-3 cyclotron frequency was
produced by energetic ions of this species undergoing drift orbit excursions to
the outer midplane plasma edge. Particle-in-cell and hybrid (kinetic ion, fluid
electron) simulations using plasma parameters corresponding to edge plasma
conditions in these JET pulses, and energetic particle parameters inferred from
the cyclotron resonance location, indicate strong excitation of waves at He-3
cyclotron harmonics, including the fundamental, which is identified with the

measurements as a method of studying confined fast particles that are strongly

equilibria correspond to the global optima of the original problem. We show
that a generalized eigenvalue (GEV) problem, including canonical correlation

characterize its stable and unstable equilibria by leveraging an invariant
group and symmetric property (more details in Section 3). Motivated by these
neat geometric structures, we propose a simple, efficient, and stochastic

sufficient conditions, based on which we establish an asymptotic convergence

motion, i.e.\@ the derivative with respect to the inverse temperature of the
normalized partition function at critical temperature. A well-known result by
Lalley and Sellke [\textit{Ann. Probab.}, 15(3):1052--1061, 1987] says that
this martingale converges almost surely to a limit $Z_\infty$, positive on the
event of survival. In this paper, our concern is the fluctuations of the
derivative martingale around its limit. A corollary of our results is the
following convergence, confirming and strengthening a conjecture by Mueller and
Munier [\textit{Phys. Rev. E}, 90:042143, 2014]: \[ \sqrt{t} \left( Z_\infty -
Z_t + \frac{\log t}{\sqrt{2\pi t}} Z_\infty \right) \xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{}
S_{Z_\infty}, \quad \text{in law}, \] where $S$ is a spectrally positive
1-stable L\'evy process independent of $Z_\infty$.
  In a first part of the paper, a relatively short proof of (a slightly
stronger form of) this convergence is given based on the functional equation
satisfied by the characteristic function of $Z_\infty$ together with tail
asymptotics of this random variable. We then set up more elaborate arguments
which yield a more thorough understanding of the trajectories of the particles
contributing to the fluctuations. In this way, we can upgrade our convergence
result to functional convergence. This approach also sets the ground for a
follow-up paper, where we study the fluctuations of more general functionals
including the renormalized critical additive martingale.
  All proofs in this paper are given under the hypothesis $E[L(\log L)^3] <
\infty$, where the random variable $L$ follows the offspring distribution of
the branching Brownian motion. We believe this hypothesis to be optimal.

the RSS 2016 Workshop on Minimality and Design Automation and the RSS 2017
Workshop on Minimality and Trade-offs in Automated Robot Design:
  The information abstractions popular within robotics, designed as they were
to address insulated sub-problems, are currently inadequate for design
automation.
  This paper's first aim is to draw together multiple threads---specifically
those of formalization, minimality, automation, and integration---and to argue
that robot design questions involve some of the most interesting and
fundamental challenges for the discipline. While most efforts in automating
robot design have focused on optimization of hardware, robot design is also
inextricably linked to the design of the internal state of the robot, how that
internal state interacts with sensors and actuators, and how task
specifications are designed within this context. Focusing attention on those
considerations is worthwhile for the study of robot design because they are
currently in a critical intellectual sweet spot, being out of reach
technically, but only just.
  The second ingredient of this paper forms a roadmap. It emphasizes two
aspects: (1) the role of models in robot design, a reprise of the old chestnut
about representation in robotics (namely, that ""the world is its own best
model""); (2) a consideration of the human-element within the envisioned scheme.

theoretical foundation for interpolated classifiers by analyzing local
interpolating schemes, including geometric simplicial interpolation algorithm
and singularly weighted $k$-nearest neighbor schemes. Consistency or
near-consistency is proved for these schemes in classification and regression
problems. Moreover, the nearest neighbor schemes exhibit optimal rates under

the possible presence of known NEOs moving in similar orbits using N-body
simulations and the D-criteria. We identify several objects moving in orbits
similar to that of 2018 LA and focus on three of them: (454100) 2013 BO73,
which is the largest of the group and a PHA, 2016 LR, and 2018 BA5, which
follows a path very close to that of 2018 LA in terms of semimajor axis,
eccentricity, and inclination. All these objects could be part of a dynamical
grouping and their orbital evolution is rather chaotic, experiencing close
encounters with Venus, the Earth-Moon system, and Mars. NEO encounters take
place at the node and, on the short-term, the relative positions of our planet
in its orbit around the Sun repeat every year. Besides the bright fireball
observed over Botswana on 2018 June 2, three other bolides were observed early
in June in recent years: Crete on 2002 June 6, Washington State on 2004 June 3,
and Reisadalen on 2007 June 7.

RFI-MDI-QKD protocol with the original MDI-QKD protocol at the transmission

four-intensity decoy-state RFI-MDI-QKD protocol with biased bases is

us from realizing intrinsic topological features such as cavities within the

detect and quantify these topological features we must turn to methods from
algebraic topology that encode data as a simplicial complex built of sets of
interacting nodes called simplices. On this substrate, we can then use the
relations between simplices and higher-order connectivity to expose cavities
within the complex, thereby summarizing its topological nature. Here we provide
an introduction to persistent homology, a fundamental method from applied

disks can potentially serve as signposts of planetary companions. They can also
lend unique insights into disk masses, which are critical in setting the mass
budget for planet formation but are difficult to determine directly. A
surprisingly high fraction of disks that have been well-studied in scattered
light have spiral arms of some kind (8/29), as do a high fraction (6/11) of
well-studied Herbig intermediate mass stars (i.e., Herbig stars $>
1.5M_\odot$). Here we explore the origin of spiral arms in Herbig systems by
studying their occurrence rates, disk properties, and stellar accretion rates.
We find that two-arm spirals are more common in disks surrounding Herbig
intermediate mass stars than are directly imaged giant planet companions to
mature A and B stars. If two-arm spirals are produced by such giant planets,
this discrepancy suggests that giant planets are much fainter than predicted by
hot start models. In addition, the high stellar accretion rates of Herbig
stars, if sustained over a reasonable fraction of their lifetimes, suggest that
disk masses are much larger than inferred from their submillimeter continuum
emission.As a result, gravitational instability is a possible explanation for
multi-arm spirals. Future observations can lend insights into the issues raised
here.

fit with a double power-law (DPL) for both the galaxy and AGN components, where
the galaxy bright-end slope has a power-law index of $-3.80\pm0.10$, and the
corresponding AGN faint-end slope is $\alpha_{AGN} = -1.49^{+0.30}_{-0.21}$. We

steeper faint-end slope of $-2.08^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$. Comparison of our galaxy

power-law shape at the bright end, the implied ionizing emissivity from AGNs is
not inconsistent with previous observations. However, if the underlying galaxy

corrections, a technical simplification over eSTGB models that allows us to
investigate, fully non-linearly, BH scalarisation in two novel directions.
Firstly, numerical simulations in spherical symmetry show, dynamically, that
Reissner-Nordstr\""om (RN) BHs evolve into a perturbatively stable scalarised
BH. Secondly, we compute the non-spherical sector of static scalarised BH
solutions bifurcating from the RN BH trunk. Scalarised BHs form an infinite

structure. Unlike the case of electrovacuum, the EMS model admits static,
asymptotically flat, regular on and outside the horizon BHs without spherical

parameters, which are: the initial mass of a star cluster, the initial
half-mass radius, and $\sigma_\mathrm{BH}$, which sets the effective Maxwellian
BH velocity kick distribution. We compare these direct $N$-body models with our
analytic estimates and newest observational constraints. The numerical
simulations show that for the one-dimensional (1D) velocity kick dispersion
$\sigma_\mathrm{BH} < 50\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, clusters with radii of 2 pc and
that are initially more massive than $5 \times 10^3\,M_\odot$ retain more than
$20\,\%$ of BHs within their half-mass radii. Our simple analytic model yields
a number of retained BHs that is in good agreement with the $N$-body models.
Furthermore, the analytic estimates show that ultra-compact dwarf galaxies
(UCDs) should have retained more than $80\,\%$ of their BHs for
$\sigma_\mathrm{BH} \leq 190\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Although our models do not
contain primordial binaries, in the most compact clusters with $10^3$ stars, we
have found evidence of delayed SN explosions producing a surplus of BHs
compared to the IMF due to dynamically formed binary stars. These cases do not
occur in the more populous or expanded clusters.

selected 870-micron sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS)

showed that each comprised a blend of emission from two or more individual
submillimetre galaxies (SMGs), separated on 5--10 arcsec scales. The six
single-dish submillimetre sources targeted correspond to a total of 14
individual SMGs, of which seven have previously-measured robust
optical/near-infrared spectroscopic redshifts, which were used to tune our ALMA
observations. We detect CO(3-2) or CO(4-3) at z=2.3--3.7 in seven of the 14
SMGs, and in addition serendipitously detect line emission from three gas-rich
companion galaxies, as well as identify four new 3.3-mm selected continuum
sources in the six fields. Joint analysis of our CO spectroscopy and existing
data suggests that 64 \pm 18% of the SMGs in blended submillimetre sources are
unlikely to be physically associated. However, three of the SMG fields (50%)
contain new, serendipitously-detected CO-emitting (but submillimetre-faint)
sources at similar redshifts to the 870-micron selected SMGs we targeted. These
data suggest that the SMGs inhabit overdense regions, but that these are not
sufficiently overdense on ~100 kpc scales to influence the source blending
given the short lifetimes of SMGs. We find that 21 \pm 12% of SMGs have
spatially-distinct and kinematically-close companion galaxies (~8--150 kpc and
<~300 km/s), which may have enhanced their star-formation via gravitational

gravitational phenomena, black holes stand out in their elegant simplicity,
while harbouring some of the most remarkable predictions of General Relativity:

direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marks
the dawn of a new era of scientific exploration. Gravitational-wave astronomy
will allow us to test models of black hole formation, growth and evolution, as
well as models of gravitational-wave generation and propagation. It will
provide evidence for event horizons and ergoregions, test the theory of General
Relativity itself, and may reveal the existence of new fundamental fields. The
synthesis of these results has the potential to radically reshape our

the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey. In all of the spectra, we measure
the line fluxes and EQWs of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) at 3.3um
and the hydrogen recombination line Br-alpha, with apertures matched to the
slit sizes of the Spitzer spectrograph and with an aperture covering ~95% of
the total flux in the AKARI 2D spectra. The star formation rates (SFRs) derived
from Br-alpha measured in the latter aperture agree well with SFRs(LIR), when
the dust extinction correction is adopted based on the 9.7um absorption
feature. Together with the Spitzer spectra, we are able to compare the 3.3 and
6.2um PAH features, the two most commonly used near/mid-IR indicators of
starburst (SB) or active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated galaxies. We find
that the 3.3 and 6.2um PAH EQWs do not follow a linear correlation and at least
1/3 of galaxies classified as AGN-dominated using 3.3um PAH are classified as
starbursts based on 6.2um PAH. These galaxies have a bluer continuum slope than
galaxies that are indicated to be SB-dominated by both PAH features. The bluer
continuum emission suggests that their continuum is dominated by stellar
emission rather than hot dust. We also find that the median Spitzer spectra of
these sources are remarkably similar to the pure SB-dominated sources indicated
by high PAH EQWs in both 3.3 and 6.2um. We propose a revised SB/AGN diagnostic
diagram using 2-5um data. We also use the AKARI and Spitzer spectra to examine
the performance of our new diagnostics and to estimate 3.3um PAH fluxes using
the JWST photometric bands in 0<z<5. Of the known PAH features and mid-IR high
ionization emission lines used as SB/AGN indicators, only the 3.3um PAH feature
is observable with JWST at z>3.5, because the rest of the features at longer
wavelengths fall outside the JWST wavelength coverage.

of the landscape potential, and it cannot be fully characterized by 3- or

accelerating rate. As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years,
all stars residing beyond the Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon
and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how
much energy could one day be extracted from them. Here, we consider the likely
response of a highly advanced civilization to this situation. In particular, we
argue that in order to maximize its access to useable energy, a sufficiently
advanced civilization would chose to expand rapidly outward, build Dyson
Spheres or similar structures around encountered stars, and use the energy that
is harnessed to accelerate those stars away from the approaching horizon and
toward the center of the civilization. We find that such efforts will be most
effective for stars with masses in the range of $M\sim (0.2-1) M_{\odot}$, and
could lead to the harvesting of stars within a region extending out to several
tens of Mpc in radius, potentially increasing the total amount of energy that
is available to a future civilization by a factor of several thousand. We also
discuss the observable signatures of a civilization elsewhere in the universe
that is currently in this state of stellar harvesting.

thermal or classical behaviour in a closed quantum system by focussing upon
local observations. This permits the remainder of the system to act as a bath,
thermalisation arising due to a process of de-phasing that gradually reveals
the thermal nature of local observables measured in an eigenstate. This is very
different from thermalisation in closed classical systems, which is driven by
dynamical chaos. We show how quantum thermalisation in closed systems can be
recast in a way that is directly related to classical thermalisation. Local
observables can be accurately captured by projecting states onto a suitable
variational manifold. Evolving on this manifold using the time-dependent
variational principle projects the quantum dynamics onto a (semi-)classical
Hamiltonian dynamics. Thermalisation in this setting is driven by dynamical
chaos. We carry out this procedure for an infinite spin chain in two ways ---
using the matrix product state ansatz for the wavefunction and for the
thermofield double purification of the density matrix --- and extract the full
Lyapunov spectrum of the resulting chaotic dynamics. This provides an
alternative perspective upon eigenstate thermalisation, pre-thermalisation and
integrability.

when an LQ problem is merely open-loop solvable not closed-loop solvable, which

collective excitations in high-T$_{\rm c}$ cuprates. Their description requires
an accurate account for electronic fluctuations at a very broad energy range
and remains a challenge for the theory. Particularly, there is no conventional
explanation of the experimentally observed `resonant' antiferromagnetic mode,
which is often considered to be a mediator of superconductivity. Here we model
spin excitations of the hole-doped cuprates in the paramagnetic regime and show
that this antiferromagnetic mode is associated with electronic transitions
between anti-nodal X and Y points of the quasiparticle band that is pinned to
the Fermi level. We observe that upon doping of 7-12\% the electronic spectral
weight redistribution leads to the formation of a very stable quasiparticle
dispersion due to strong correlation effects. The reconstruction of the Fermi
surface results in a flattening of the quasiparticle band at the vicinity of
the nodal ${\rm M}\Gamma/2$ point, accompanied by a high density of charge
carriers. Collective excitations of electrons between the nodal ${\rm
M}\Gamma/2$ and ${\rm XM}/2$ points form the additional magnetic holes state in
magnetic spectrum, which protects the antiferromagnetic fluctuation. Further
investigation of the evolution of spin fluctuations with the temperature and
doping allowed us to observe the incipience of the antiferromagnetic ordering
already in the paramagnetic regime above the transition temperature.
Additionally, apart from the most intensive low-energy magnetic excitations,
the magnetic spectrum reveals less intensive collective spin fluctuations that
correspond to electronic processes between peaks of the single-particle
spectral function.

dynamics of pseudo-spins (PSs) is applied for the first time to study the
relaxion-ferroelectric-phase-transition (RFPT) of
perovskite-relaxor-ferroelectrics (PRFEs) in detail. To solve this model, we
proposed a new method, mean-field of PS-strings (MF-PSSs). We find: 1) 3D-RSIM
is a mixed system consisting of permanent-paraelectric-subsystem (PPSS),
low-transition-temperature ferroelectric-subsystem (LTT-FSS), and
high-transition-temperature ferroelectric-subsystem (HTT-FSS). The contents of
these three subsystems change with the PS concentration (phi) of the model; 2)
When phi < phi_p (phi_p is the percolation threshold of the 3D-RSIM), HTT-FSS
dominates the whole system. On cooling, the system undergoes an
inhomogeneous-diffuse-ferroelectric-phase-transition (IDFPT), and as phi
increases, it shows a crossover from the critical, gradually to Vogel-Fulcher,
and to Arrehnius type slowdown. Specifically, we observe this crossover from
the relationship between the peak temperature (Tm) of the real susceptibility
of the correlated relaxation of PSs and angular frequency (omega); 3) When phi
= phi_p, the three subsystems have comparable contents. However, as temperature
decreases, the spontaneous polarization and specific heat of the whole system
show an IDFPT, but Tm shifts to lower temperature with omega until 0K. Since
the relaxation time of PPSS rapidly increases at lower temperature and diverges
at 0K, during a cooling process at a limited rate, PPSS must be frozen at a
certain temperature, i.e. PS glass transition occurs. In short, with the
increase of phi, 3D-RSIGM gradually evolves from the IDFPT system to PS glass
system, and phi_p is the characteristic concentration of this evolution.
Moreover, based on the coupling between PSs and crystal lattice, we also give a
new possible mechanism of Burns transformation.

challenging, even for modern methods that leverage deep neural networks trained

that trains a deep neural network to determine whether patches in a noisy image
input share common underlying patterns. Given a pair of noisy patches, our
network predicts whether different sub-band coefficients of the original
noise-free patches are similar. The denoising algorithm then aggregates matched
coefficients to obtain an initial estimate of the clean image. Finally, this
estimate is provided as input, along with the original noisy image, to a
standard regression-based denoising network. Experiments show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art color image denoising performance, including with a

not require knowledge of level of noise in an input image. Our approach also

and in particular Ohio. However, the burden of the epidemic is challenging to
quantify as public health surveillance measures capture different aspects of
the problem. Here we synthesize county-level death and treatment counts to
compare the relative burden across counties and assess associations with social
environmental covariates. Methods: We construct a generalized spatial factor
model to jointly model death and treatment rates for each county. For each
outcome, we specify a spatial rates parameterization for a Poisson regression
model with spatially varying factor loadings. We use a conditional
autoregressive model to account for spatial dependence within a Bayesian
framework. Results: The estimated spatial factor was highest in the southern
and southwestern counties of the state, representing a higher burden of the
opioid epidemic. We found that relatively high rates of treatment contributed
to the factor in the southern part of the state; whereas, relatively higher
rates of death contributed in the southwest. The estimated factor was also
positively associated with the proportion of residents aged 18-64 on disability
and negatively associated with the proportion of residents reporting white
race. Conclusions: We synthesized the information in the opioid associated
death and treatment counts through a spatial factor model to estimate a latent
factor representing the consensus between the two surveillance measures. We
believe this framework provides a coherent approach to describe the epidemic
while leveraging information from multiple surveillance measures.

smoother decision boundaries at multiple levels of representation. As a result,
neural networks trained with Manifold Mixup learn class-representations with
fewer directions of variance. We prove theory on why this flattening happens

multivariate framelets with directionality or high vanishing moments are of
interest and importance in both theory and applications. In this paper we
introduce the notion of a quasi-tight framelet, which is a dual framelet, but
behaves almost like a tight framelet. Let $\phi\in L_2(R^d)$ be an arbitrary
compactly supported $M$-refinable function such that its underlying low-pass
filter satisfies the basic sum rule. We first constructively prove by a
step-by-step algorithm that we can always easily derive from the arbitrary
$M$-refinable function $\phi$ a directional compactly supported quasi-tight
$M$-framelet in $L_2(R^d)$ associated with a directional quasi-tight
$M$-framelet filter bank, each of whose high-pass filters has only two nonzero
coefficients with opposite signs. If in addition all the coefficients of its
low-pass filter are nonnegative, such a quasi-tight $M$-framelet becomes a
directional tight $M$-framelet in $L_2(R^d)$. Furthermore, we show by a
constructive algorithm that we can always derive from the arbitrary
$M$-refinable function $\phi$ a compactly supported quasi-tight $M$-framelet in
$L_2(R^d)$ with the highest possible order of vanishing moments. We shall also
present a result on quasi-tight framelets whose associated high-pass filters
are purely differencing filters with the highest order of vanishing moments.

default MIXMAX generators have various dimensions: $N=8,17,240$ and higher.
Therefore the spectral test is important to perform in dimensions $d > 8$ for
$N=8$ generator, $d> 17$ for $N=17$ and $d> 240$ for $N=240$ generator. These

universal coordinate of time and to attribute its non-geodesic alignment to the

generates gravity, but also electric charge does. Charge is, however, coupled
to a non-geodesic vector field and thus is not totally equivalent to inertial
mass. Only the entire ""Energy-Momentum"" tensor has a vanishing divergence. The
model can be seen as misalignment of physically accessible events in an
observer spacetime and of gravity as a controlling response by volumetric
contraction of the observer spacetime in the direction where events bend or
accelerate to. This non geodesic acceleration is described by a generalization
of the Reeb vector. Misalignment of events can be described by 1, 2, and 3 such

Structure Constant where added or subtracted area in relation to a disk does
not involve a ratio 1/24 but 1/96 due to the physical meaning of the
orientation of a space foliation which is perpendicular to a time-like vector
and due to the orientation of a plane which is perpendicular to a time-like
vector. These two orientations mean that only one side of a 3-dimensional
foliation has a physical meaning and only one side of a sub-plane of that
foliation has a physical meaning then 1/2 1/2 1/24=1/96. Another interpretation
of the factor 1/4 is the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy to area constant. An
additional coefficient 4/{\pi} describes an acceleration field strength and has
a compelling source in mainstream physics. Other two field strength
coefficients are less understood but are very intuitive, these are 95/96 and a

progress of the search process. Another way of tackling optimization problems
is by the use of heuristic approximations to estimate a global cost minimum.
Here we present a combination of these two approaches by using cover-encoding
maps which map processes from a larger search space to subsets of the original
search space. The key idea is to construct cover-encoding maps with the help of
suitable heuristics that single out near-optimal solutions and result in
landscapes on the larger search space that no longer exhibit trapping local
minima. We present cover-encoding maps for the problems of the traveling

lower than 1. When the modified parameter is varied, the typical positions of
the corresponding images do not change, nor does the typical redshift factor
associated with the primary image. However, another typical redshift factor
associated with the secondary image increases when the modified parameter is
increased. We also find that the fluxes increase in that case. These images
appear periodically with period greater than that of Kerr. This provides an
alternative signature away from the Kerr case which may be tested by the Event
Horizon Telescope.

on a wide variety of tasks. Although face recognition is probably the most
widely researched, many other tasks such as kinship detection, facial
expression classification and facial aging have been examined. In this work we
propose the new, subjective task of quantifying perceived face similarity
between a pair of faces. That is, we predict the perceived similarity between
facial images, given that they are not of the same person. Although this task
is clearly correlated with face recognition, it is different and therefore
justifies a separate investigation. Humans often remark that two persons look
alike, even in cases where the persons are not actually confused with one
another. In addition, because face similarity is different than traditional
image similarity, there are challenges in data collection and labeling, and
dealing with diverging subjective opinions between human labelers. We present
evidence that finding facial look-alikes and recognizing faces are two distinct
tasks. We propose a new dataset for facial similarity and introduce the
Lookalike network, directed towards similar face classification, which
outperforms the ad hoc usage of a face recognition network directed at the same
task.

by developing a game-theoretic framework that proved that the ideal inequality
is a lognormal distribution of income at equilibrium. In this paper, we develop
another approach, using the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) framework, which
also leads to the same conclusion. Even though the conclusion is the same, the
new approach, however, reveals the true nature of NBS, which has been of
considerable interest for several decades. Economists have wondered about the
economic meaning or purpose of the NBS. While some have alluded to its fairness

efficient wireless indoor access networks, namely, a hybrid system enabled by
traditional RF access, such as WiFi, as well as the emerging visible light
communication (VLC). VLC facilitates the great advantage of being able to
jointly perform illumination and communications, and little extra power beyond
illumination is required to empower communications, thus rendering wireless
access with almost zero power consumption. On the other hand, when illumination
is not required from the light source, the energy consumed by VLC could be more
than that consumed by the RF. By capitalizing on the above properties, the
proposed hybrid RF-VLC system is more energy efficient and more adaptive to the
illumination conditions than the individual VLC or RF systems. To demonstrate
the viability of the proposed system, we first formulate the problem of
minimizing the power consumption of the hybrid RF-VLC system while satisfying
the users requests and maintaining acceptable level of illumination, which is
NP-complete. Therefore, we divide the problem into two subproblems. In the
first subproblems, we determine the set of VLC access points (AP) that needs to
be turned on to satisfy the illumination requirements. Given this set, we turn
our attention to satisfying the users' requests for real-time communications,
and we propose a randomized online algorithm that, against an oblivious
adversary, achieves a competitive ratio of $\log(N)\log(M)$ with probability of
success $1 - \frac{1}{N}$, where $N$ is the number of users and $M$ is the
number of VLC and RF APs. We also show that the best online algorithm to solve
this problem can achieve a competitive ratio of $\log(M)$. Simulation results
further demonstrate the advantages of the hybrid system.

  Recognition Problems",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A good classification method should yield more accurate results than simple
heuristics. But there are classification problems, especially high-dimensional
ones like the ones based on image/video data, for which simple heuristics can
work quite accurately; the structure of the data in such problems is easy to
uncover without any sophisticated or computationally expensive method. On the
other hand, some problems have a structure that can only be found with
sophisticated pattern recognition methods. We are interested in quantifying the
difficulty of a given high-dimensional pattern recognition problem. We consider
the case where the patterns come from two pre-determined classes and where the
objects are represented by points in a high-dimensional vector space. However,
the framework we propose is extendable to an arbitrarily large number of
classes. We propose classification benchmarks based on simple random projection
heuristics. Our benchmarks are 2D curves parameterized by the classification
error and computational cost of these simple heuristics. Each curve divides the
plane into a ""positive- gain"" and a ""negative-gain"" region. The latter contains
methods that are ill-suited for the given classification problem. The former is
divided into two by the curve asymptote; methods that lie in the small region
under the curve but right of the asymptote merely provide a computational gain
but no structural advantage over the random heuristics. We prove that the curve
asymptotes are optimal (i.e. at Bayes error) in some cases, and thus no
sophisticated method can provide a structural advantage over the random
heuristics. Such classification problems, an example of which we present in our
numerical experiments, provide poor ground for testing new pattern
classification methods.

epidemic outbreak on a graph. We assume that successive infections occur via
contagion; i.e., transmissions can only spread across existing directed edges
in the graph. Our stochastic spreading model allows individual nodes to be
infected more than once, and the probability of the transmission spreading
across a particular edge is proportional to both the cumulative number of times
the source nodes has been infected in previous stages of the epidemic and the
weight parameter of the edge. We propose a maximum likelihood estimator for
inferring the unknown edge weights when full information is available
concerning the order and identity of successive edge transmissions. When the
weights take a particular form as exponential functions of a linear combination
of known edge covariates, we show that maximum likelihood estimation amounts to
optimizing a convex function, and produces a solution that is both consistent
and asymptotically normal. Our proofs are based on martingale convergence
theorems and the theory of weighted P\'{o}lya urns. We also show how our theory
may be generalized to settings where the weights are not exponential. Finally,
we analyze the case where the available infection data comes in the form of an
unordered set of edge transmissions. We propose two algorithms for weight
parameter estimation in this setting and derive corresponding theoretical
guarantees. Our methods are validated using both synthetic data and real-world

reconnection and the global hydrodynamical evolution of the system. We consider
both the collision between two radially expanding bubbles where reconnection is
seeded by the pre-existing X-point, and the collision between two flows in a
quasi-1D geometry with initially anti-parallel fields where reconnection must
be initiated by the tearing instability. In both geometries, at a baseline case
of low-collisionality and low background density, the current sheet is strongly
compressed to below scale of the ion-skin-depth scale, and rapid,
multi-plasmoid reconnection results. Increasing the plasma resistivity, we
observe a collisional slow-down of reconnection and stabilization of plasmoid
instability for Lundquist numbers less than approximately $S \sim 10^3$.
Secondly, increasing the background plasma density modifies the compressibility
of the plasma and can also slow-down or even prevent reconnection, even in
completely collisionless regimes, by preventing the current sheet from thinning
down to the scale of the ion-skin depth. These results have implications for
understanding recent and future experiments, and signatures for these processes

  various magnetic features on the surface of the Sun","Published in the Astrophysical Journal","2018 ApJ 862 35","10.3847/1538-4357/aaccf1",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The solar mean magnetic field (SMMF) is referred to as the disc-averaged
line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field that also reflects the polarity imbalance of
the magnetic field on the Sun. The origin of the SMMF has been debated over the
past few decades, with one school of thought suggesting that the contribution
to the SMMF is mostly due to the large scale magnetic field structure, also
termed as the background magnetic field, whereas other and more recent studies
have indicated that active regions have a major contribution to the observed
SMMF. In this paper, we re-investigate the issue of the origin of the SMMF by
decomposing the solar disk into plages, networks, sunspots and background
regions, thereby calculating the variation in the observed SMMF due to each of
these features. We have used full disk images from SDO/{\it AIA} recorded at
1600~\AA\, for earmarking plages, networks and background regions and
4500~\AA\, images for separating the sunspots. The LOS fields corresponding to
each of these regions are estimated from the co-temporal SDO/{\it HMI} full
disk magnetograms. The temporal variation of the SMMF shows a near one-to-one
correspondence with that of the background field regions suggesting that they
constitute the major component of the observed SMMF. A linear regression
analysis based on the coefficient of determination shows that the background
field dominates, and accounts for 89\% of the variation in the SMMF whereas the
magnetic field from the other features accounts for the rest 11\%.

The internal action in this environment leads to changes the hierarchy of HAMs.
We propose the classical Q-learning procedure in the internal environment which

Hessian matrix at the global minimum of a random $N \gg 1$ dimensional
isotropic, translationally invariant Gaussian random landscape confined by a
parabolic potential with fixed curvature $\mu>0$. Simple landscapes with
generically a single minimum are typical for $\mu>\mu_{c}$, and we show that
the Hessian at the global minimum is always {\it gapped}, with the low spectral
edge being strictly positive. When approaching from above the transitional
point $\mu= \mu_{c}$ separating simple landscapes from 'glassy' ones, with
exponentially abundant minima, the spectral gap vanishes as $(\mu-\mu_c)^2$.
For $\mu<\mu_c$ the Hessian spectrum is qualitatively different for 'moderately
complex' and 'genuinely complex' landscapes. The former are typical for
short-range correlated random potentials and correspond to 1-step
replica-symmetry breaking mechanism. Their Hessian spectra turn out to be again
gapped, with the gap vanishing on approaching $\mu_c$ from below with a larger
critical exponent, as $(\mu_c-\mu)^4$. At the same time in the 'most complex'
landscapes with long-ranged power-law correlations the replica symmetry is
completely broken. We show that in that case the Hessian remains gapless for
all values of $\mu<\mu_c$, indicating the presence of 'marginally stable'
spatial directions. Finally, the potentials with {\it logarithmic} correlations
share both 1RSB nature and gapless spectrum. The spectral density of the
Hessian always takes the semi-circular form, up to a shift and an amplitude
that we explicitly calculate.

correctness of a distributed system is largely determined by its handling of
failure scenarios. The sequence of events leading to a bug can be long and
complex, and it is likely to include message reorderings and failures. On
single-node systems, interactive debuggers enable stepping through an execution
of the program, but they lack the ability to easily simulate failure scenarios
and control the order in which messages are delivered.
  Oddity is a graphical, interactive debugger for distributed systems. It
brings the power of traditional step-through debugging---fine-grained control
and observation of a program as it executes---to distributed systems. It also
enables exploratory testing, in which an engineer examines and perturbs the
behavior of a system in order to better understand it, perhaps without a
specific bug in mind. A programmer can directly control message and failure
interleaving. Oddity supports time travel, allowing a developer to explore
multiple branching executions of a system within a single debugging session.
Above all, Oddity encourages distributed systems thinking: rather than assuming
the normal case and attaching failure handling as an afterthought, distributed
systems should be developed around the certainty of message loss and node
failure.
  Graduate and undergraduate students used Oddity in two distributed systems
classes. Usage tracking and qualitative surveys showed that students found
Oddity useful for both debugging and exploratory testing.

their potential to one-day control a number of devastating diseases, among

risky. In particular, there is little in the way of empirical evidence of the
long-term robustness of these synthetic systems against mutational breakdown.
Rather, most existing systems are either known or predicted to be susceptible
to rapid inactivation, though methodological designs continue to be refined.
Here we evaluate a currently existing synthetic, underdominance-based gene
drive system 200+ generations after it was first established in a laboratory
colony of Drosophila melanogaster. Not only do we find that the system is still
functioning as designed, we also show evidence that disruptions to the genetic
construct are highly likely to be removed by natural selection, contributing to
the system's robust, long-term stability. This stability appears to be a result
of a fundamental relationship between ribosomal proteins (a novel target of the
system) and natural cellular defenses that protect against cancer development.
As far as we are aware, this is the longest continually functioning synthetic
gene drive system thus verified, making it highly appropriate for additional
research into its eventual suitability for field trials. Due to inherent
properties of this gene drive, it is also likely to be adaptable for use in
many different species. The insect lines established and used to test this
system have been deposited at a Drosophila stock center, and are available to
labs for further, independent testing.

Wireless Commun",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Relay systems improve both coverage and system capacity. Towards this
direction, full-duplex (FD) technology, being able to boost the spectral
efficiency by transmitting and receiving simultaneously on the same frequency
and time resources, is envisaged to play a key role in future networks.
However, its benefits come at the expense of self-interference (SI) from their
own transmit signal. At the same time, massive MIMO systems, bringing
unconventionally many antennas, emerge as a promising technology with huge
degrees-of-freedom (DoF). To this end, this paper considers a multi-pair
decode-and-forward FD relay channel, where the relay station is deployed with a
large number of antennas. Moreover, the rate-splitting (RS) transmission has
recently been shown to provide significant performance benefits in various
multi-user scenarios with imperfect channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT). Engaging the RS approach, we employ the deterministic
equivalent (DE) analysis to derive the corresponding sum-rates in the presence
of interferences. Initially, numerical results demonstrate the robustness of RS
in half-duplex (HD) systems, since the achievable sum-rate increases without
bound, i.e., it does not saturate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Next, we
tackle the detrimental effect of SI in FD. In particular, and most importantly,
not only FD outperforms HD, but also RS enables increasing the range of SI over
which FD outperforms HD. Furthermore, increasing the number of relay station
antennas, RS appears to be more efficacious due to imperfect CSIT, since SI
decreases. Interestingly, increasing the number of users, the efficiency of RS
worsens and its implementation becomes less favorable under these conditions.
Finally, we verify that the proposed DEs, being accurate for a large number of
relay station antennas, are tight approximations even for realistic system
dimensions.

quasi-potential is a crucial function in the Large Deviation Theory that allows
one to estimate transition rates between attractors of the corresponding
ordinary differential equation and find the maximum likelihood transition
paths. Unfortunately, the quasi-potential can rarely be found analytically. It
is defined as the solution to a certain action minimization problem. In this
work, the recently introduced Ordered Line Integral Method (OLIM) is extended
for computing the quasi-potential for 2D SDEs with anisotropic and
position-dependent diffusion scaled by a small parameter on a regular
rectangular mesh. The presented solver employs the dynamical programming
principle. At each step, a local action minimization problem is solved using
straight line path segments and the midpoint quadrature rule. The solver is
tested on two examples where analytic formulas for the quasi-potential are
available. The dependence of the computational error on the mesh size, the
update factor K (a key parameter of OLIMs), as well as the degree and the
orientation of anisotropy is established. The effect of anisotropy on the
quasi-potential and the maximum likelihood paths is demonstrated on the
Maier-Stein model. The proposed solver is applied to find the quasi-potential

Lambda Phage between the lysogenic state where the phage reproduces inside the
infected cell without killing it, and the lytic state where the phage destroys

results in a significant increase of the outage probability, especially for the

station (BS) cooperation to improve the performance of the cell-edge users in
the downlink transmission of mmWave cellular networks. We design two
cooperative schemes, which are referred to as fixed-number BS cooperation (FNC)

scheme, the cooperative BSs consist of the M nearest BSs around the served
cell-edge users, and in FRC scheme, the cooperative BSs include all the BSs

on the stochastic geometry framework. To reduce the computational complexity of

then synchronizes itself with the strongest SS. A FBS also can transmit a SS

countermeasure to the FBS attack by utilizing the location information is
investigated. Two location awareness based FBS-resistance schemes are proposed

probability that the UE will connect to the FBS is investigated. Numeric
results show that with the two proposed schemes, the SCR can be greatly reduced

chronic heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI). Conventional MI
evaluation methods are; however, preoperatively performed and/or give an
indirect information of myocardial viability such as shape, color, and blood
flow. In this study, we realize the evaluation of MI in patients undergoing
cardiac surgery by Raman spectroscopy under label-free conditions, which is
based on intrinsic molecular constituents related to myocardial viability. We
identify key signatures of Raman spectra for the evaluation of myocardial
viability by evaluating the infarct border zone myocardium that were excised
from five patients under surgical ventricular restoration. We also obtain a
prediction model to differentiate the infarcted myocardium from the
non-infarcted myocardium by applying partial least squares
regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to the Raman spectra. Our prediction
model enables identification of the infarcted tissues and the non-infarcted
tissues with sensitivities of 99.98% and 99.92%, respectively. Furthermore, the
prediction model of the Raman images of the infarct border zone enabled us to
visualize boundaries between these distinct regions. Our novel application of
Raman spectroscopy to the human heart would be a useful means for the detection
of myocardial viability during surgery.

the characteristics of depositing a droplet onto a cold surface and the

of a triple condensate halo observed during the deposition of a water droplet
onto a cold surface, due to the interplay between droplet impact dynamics and
vapor diffusion. Two subsequent condensation stages occur during the droplet
spreading and cooling processes, engendering this unique condensate halo with
three distinctive bands. We further proposed a scaling model to interpret the
size of each band, and the model is validated by the experiments of droplets
with different impact velocity and varying substrate temperature. Our
experimental and theoretical investigation of the droplet impact dynamics and

their applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of
hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed
method, agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a
trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features,
along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This
hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned
are predictive. Using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet,
we show that ACD is effective at diagnosing incorrect predictions and
identifying dataset bias. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD
enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better
trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to
adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the
input and ignores spurious noise.

radiation field from the pickup. The resulting interaction produces a
longitudinal kick with its value depending on the particles momentum which,

acceleration on the entanglement dynamics, which are closely related to the
orientations of polarization. For the parallel case, the initial entanglement
of two transversely polarizable atoms very close to the boundary can be
preserved as if it were a closed system, while for two vertically polarizable
atoms, the concurrence evolves two times as fast as that in the free space. In
the presence of a boundary, entanglement revival is possible for two atoms
initially in the symmetric state depending on the orientations of the atomic
polarizations, which is in sharp contrast to the fact that the concurrence
always decays monotonically in the free space. Interestingly, two initially
separable atoms, for which entanglement generation can never happen in the free
space with any given acceleration and separation, can get entangled in the
presence of a boundary if they are aligned parallel to the boundary. The birth
time of entanglement can be noticeably advanced or postponed for the parallel
two-atom system placed close to the boundary, while the maximal concurrence
during evolution can be significantly enhanced when the atoms are vertically
aligned. Moreover, two inertial atoms with different polarizations remain
separable all the time, while as the acceleration increases, the delayed birth
of entanglement happens, and the nonzero concurrence can be enhanced.

which expresses the number of solutions of generic systems in terms of the
mixed volume of their Newton polytopes. We give complete proofs, over arbitrary

development of toric geometry. Care was taken to make this book as elementary

a result that is relevant to recent simulation studies and quasi-elastic
neutron scattering measurements. In contrast, in the same format strongly
non-universal behavior is found for the activation barrier that controls long
time relaxation. Two measures of cooperativity in ECNLE theory are analyzed. A
particle-level total displacement associated with the alpha relaxation event is
found to be only of order 1-2 particle diameters and weakly increases with
cooling. In contrast, an alternative cooperativity length is defined as the
spatial scale required to recover the full barrier and bulk alpha time. This
length scale grows strongly with cooling due to the emergence in the deeply
supercooled regime of collective long range elastic fluctuations required to
allow local hopping. It becomes very large as the laboratory Tg is approached,
though is relatively modest at degrees of supercooling accessible with
molecular dynamics simulation. The alpha time is found to be exponentially
related to this cooperativity length over an enormous number of decades of
relaxation time that span the lightly to deeply supercooled regimes. Moreover,
the effective barrier height increases almost linearly with the growing
cooperativity length scale. An alternative calculation of the collective
elastic barrier based on a literal continuum mechanics approach is shown to
result in very little change of the theoretical results for bulk properties,

$\approx5\%$ of mergers in globular clusters result from three-body
interactions. These three-body interactions are expected to induce significant
orbital eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.1$ when they enter the Advanced LIGO band at a
gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz. Measurements of binary black hole
eccentricity therefore provide a means for determining whether or not dynamic
formation is the primary channel for producing binary black hole mergers. We
present a framework for performing Bayesian parameter estimation on
gravitational-wave observations of black hole inspirals. Using this framework,
and employing the non-spinning, inspiral-only EccentricFD waveform approximant,
we determine the minimum detectable eccentricity for an event with masses and
distance similar to GW150914. At design sensitivity, we find that the current
generation of advanced observatories will be sensitive to orbital
eccentricities of $\gtrsim0.05$ at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz,
demonstrating that existing detectors can use eccentricity to distinguish
between circular field binaries and globular cluster triples. We compare this
result to eccentricity distributions predicted to result from three black hole
binary formation channels, showing that measurements of eccentricity could be

determine the ground truth times of bites. Bite times were operationally

  Signals",,,"10.1109/TSP.2019.2899822",,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern data introduces new challenges to classic signal processing
approaches, leading to a growing interest in the field of graph signal
processing. A powerful and well established model for real world signals in
various domains is sparse representation over a dictionary, combined with the
ability to train the dictionary from signal examples. This model has been
successfully applied to graph signals as well by integrating the underlying
graph topology into the learned dictionary. Nonetheless, dictionary learning
methods for graph signals are typically restricted to small dimensions due to
the computational constraints that the dictionary learning problem entails, and
due to the direct use of the graph Laplacian matrix. In this paper, we propose
a dictionary learning algorithm that applies to a broader class of graph
signals, and is capable of handling much higher dimensional data. We
incorporate the underlying graph topology both implicitly, by forcing the
learned dictionary atoms to be sparse combinations of graph-wavelet functions,
and explicitly, by adding direct graph constraints to promote smoothness in
both the feature and manifold domains. The resulting atoms are thus adapted to
the data of interest while adhering to the underlying graph structure and
possessing a desired multi-scale property. Experimental results on several
datasets, representing both synthetic and real network data of different
nature, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for graph
signal processing even in high dimensions.

value of a signal at a certain time point in the future, but also the values
leading up to that point. This is especially true in clinical applications,
where the future state of the patient can be less important than the patient's
overall trajectory. This requires multi-step forecasting, a forecasting variant
where one aims to predict multiple values in the future simultaneously.
Standard methods to accomplish this can propagate error from prediction to
prediction, reducing quality over the long term. In light of these challenges,
we propose multi-output deep architectures for multi-step forecasting in which
we explicitly model the distribution of future values of the signal over a
prediction horizon. We apply these techniques to the challenging and clinically
relevant task of blood glucose forecasting. Through a series of experiments on
a real-world dataset consisting of 550K blood glucose measurements, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in capturing the
underlying signal dynamics. Compared to existing shallow and deep methods, we
find that our proposed approaches improve performance individually and capture
complementary information, leading to a large improvement over the baseline
when combined (4.87 vs. 5.31 absolute percentage error (APE)). Overall, the
results suggest the efficacy of our proposed approach in predicting blood
glucose level and multi-step forecasting more generally.

1510-089. We aim to characterize and model the source in a broad-band context,
which would provide a baseline over which high states and flares could be
better understood. We use daily binned Fermi-LAT flux measurements of PKS
1510-089 to characterize the GeV emission and select the observation periods of
MAGIC during low state of activity. For the selected times we compute the
average radio, IR, optical, UV, X-ray and gamma-ray emission to construct a
low-state spectral energy distribution of the source. The broadband emission is
modelled within an External Compton scenario with a stationary emission region
through which plasma and magnetic field are flowing. We perform also the
emission-model-independent calculations of the maximum absorption in the broad
line region (BLR) using two different models. Results. The MAGIC telescopes
collected 75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1
GeV was below 3x10-8cm-2s-1, which is the threshold adopted for the definition
of a low gamma-ray activity state. The data show a strongly significant
(9.5{\sigma}) VHE gamma-ray emission at the level of
(4.27+-0.61stat)x10-12cm-2s-1 above 150GeV, a factor 80 smaller than the
highest flare observed so far from this object. Despite the lower flux, the
spectral shape is consistent with earlier detections in the VHE band. The
broad-band emission is compatible with the EC scenario assuming a large
emission region located beyond the BLR. For the first time the gamma-ray data
allow us to place a limit on the location of the emission region during a low
gamma-ray state of a FSRQ. For the used model of the BLR, the 95% C.L. on the
location of the emission region allows us to place it at the distance >74% of
the outer radius of the BLR.

  dynamo models",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this study, we investigate preferences of dipolar magnetic structure from
a seed magnetic field in the rapidly rotating spherical shell dynamo models. In
this study, we set up a realistic model to show the effect of the Lorentz force
in the polarity selection. The important results that has come out from our
study is that the magnetic field acts on the flow much before the saturation.
Our study suggests that the growth of the magnetic field is not a kinematic
effect as one might think off, rather a dynamic effect. This dynamic effect
grows as the field generated with time and finally brings the saturation to the
dynamo action. Previous studies show that Lorentz force effect the flow when
Elsasser number more or less 1 and the studies were focused on the saturation
by looking at the time-averaged quantities. However, in this study, we show a
clear effect of the Lorentz force even at Elsasser number of $0.3-0.4$. To show
the effect of the Lorentz force, we did two different simulations, one is a
nonlinear model and another is kinematic model and shows that how a magnetic
field can change the flow structure and by doing that the generated field
changes, while this kind of behavior is not observed in kinematic dynamo
models. This study shows a scale dependent behaviour of the kinetic helicity at
two different spectral range.

challenging task, where most of the existing methods treat each object part in

MAMC functions by pulling same-attention same-class features closer, while
pushing different-attention or different-class features away. Our method can be
easily trained end-to-end, and is highly efficient which requires only one
training stage. Moreover, we introduce Dogs-in-the-Wild, a comprehensive dog

characteristics, including that loops appear to cool and have higher than
expected densities. Two potential heating scenarios have been suggested to
explain these observations. One scenario is that the loops are heated by a
series of small-scale impulsive heating events, or nanoflares. Another
hypothesis is that the heating is quasi-steady and highly-stratified, i.e.,
``footpoint heating'. The goal of this paper is to identify observables that
can be used to differentiate between these two heating scenarios. For footpoint
heating, we vary the heating magnitude and stratification, for impulsive
heating, we vary the heating magnitude. We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic
codes to calculate the resulting temperature and density evolution and expected
lightcurves in four channels of AIA and one channel of XRT. We consider two
principal diagnostics: the time lag between the appearance of the loop in two
different channels, and the ratio of the peak intensities of the loop in the
two channels. We find that 1) footpoint heating can predict longer time lags
than impulsive heating, 2) footpoint heating can predict zero or negative time
lags, 3) the intensity ratio expected from impulsive heating is confined to a
narrow range, while footpoint heating predicts a wider range of intensity
ratios, and 4) the range of temperatures expected in impulsive heating is
broader than the range of temperatures expected in footpoint heating. This
preliminary study identifies observables that may be useful in discriminating
between heating models in future work.

problem, Studies in the Mathematical Theory of Inventory and Production, pages
201-209] on the newsvendor problem with ambiguity in the demand distribution,
there has been a growing interest in the study of the distributionally robust
newsvendor problem. The model is criticized at times for being overly
conservative since the worst-case distribution is discrete with a few support
points. However, it is the order quantity prescribed from the model that is of
practical relevance. A simple calculation shows that the optimal order quantity
in Scarf's model with known first and second moment is also optimal for a
censored student-t distribution with parameter 2. In this paper, we generalize
this ""heavy-tail optimality"" property of the distributionally robust newsvendor
to an ambiguity set where information on the first and the $\alpha$th moment is
known, for any real number $\alpha > 1$. We show that the optimal order
quantity for the distributionally robust newsvendor problem is also optimal for
a regularly varying distribution with roughly a power law tail with tail index
$\alpha$. We illustrate the usefulness of the model in the high service level
regime with numerical experiments, by showing that when a standard distribution
such as the exponential or lognormal distribution is contaminated with a
heavy-tailed (regularly varying) distribution, the distributionally robust
optimal order quantity outperforms the optimal order quantity of the original
distribution, even with a small amount of contamination.

requisite geometric tests, but retaining most of the the simplicity and

Observatory, we have observed the radio emission from 561 extensive air showers
with zenith angles between 60$^\circ$ and 84$^\circ$. In contrast to air
showers with more vertical incidence, these inclined air showers illuminate
large ground areas of several km$^2$ with radio signals detectable in the 30 to
80\,MHz band. A comparison of the measured radio-signal amplitudes with Monte
Carlo simulations of a subset of 50 events for which we reconstruct the energy
using the Auger surface detector shows agreement within the uncertainties of
the current analysis. As expected for forward-beamed radio emission undergoing
no significant absorption or scattering in the atmosphere, the area illuminated
by radio signals grows with the zenith angle of the air shower. Inclined air
showers with EeV energies are thus measurable with sparse radio-antenna arrays
with grid sizes of a km or more. This is particularly attractive as radio
detection provides direct access to the energy in the electromagnetic cascade
of an air shower, which in case of inclined air showers is not accessible by
arrays of particle detectors on the ground.

of butterflies have XXZ Heisenberg interaction with two extra spin-1/2

the transfer matrix approach, then we examine the magnetization process, as

the magnetic field and anisotropy variations. Moreover, some unexpected

variety of pathologies such as vanishing/exploding gradients make training such

do enable training at these depths, it has remained unclear whether such
specialized architecture designs are truly necessary to train deep CNNs. In
this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to train vanilla CNNs with ten
thousand layers or more simply by using an appropriate initialization scheme.
We derive this initialization scheme theoretically by developing a mean field
theory for signal propagation and by characterizing the conditions for
dynamical isometry, the equilibration of singular values of the input-output
Jacobian matrix. These conditions require that the convolution operator be an
orthogonal transformation in the sense that it is norm-preserving. We present
an algorithm for generating such random initial orthogonal convolution kernels
and demonstrate empirically that they enable efficient training of extremely
deep architectures.

a new RNN cell with a simple gating mechanism that we call the minimalRNN and
compare it with vanilla RNNs. Our theory allows us to define a maximum
timescale over which RNNs can remember an input. We show that this theory
predicts trainability for both recurrent architectures. We show that gated
recurrent networks feature a much broader, more robust, trainable region than
vanilla RNNs, which corroborates recent experimental findings. Finally, we
develop a closed-form critical initialization scheme that achieves dynamical
isometry in both vanilla RNNs and minimalRNNs. We show that this results in
significantly improvement in training dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that
the minimalRNN achieves comparable performance to its more complex
counterparts, such as LSTMs or GRUs, on a language modeling task.

compression corresponds to processes in core-collapse supernova explosions
after neutrino trapping. Conditions provided in the experiments resemble those
in core-collapse supernovae, permitting their use for laboratory astrophysics.
A unique feature of the experiments is compression at low entropy. The values
of specific entropy are close to those obtained in numerical simulations during
the process of collapse in supernova explosions, and much lower than those
obtained at laser ignition facilities, another type of high-compression
experiment. Both in supernovae and HE experiments the bounce occurs at low
entropy, so the HE experiments provide a new platform to realize some supernova
collapse effects in laboratory, especially to study hydrodynamics of collapsing
flows and the bounce. Due to the good resolution of diagnostics in the
compression of macroscopic amounts of material with essential effects of
nonideal plasma in EOS, and observed development of 3D instabilities, these
experiments may serve as a useful benchmark for astrophysical hydrodynamic

paper develops a theoretical SPPC price model with a framework for a marginal
utility-based price, which previous studies proposed is the price of contingent
claims in an incomplete market. This paper's contribution is fivefold. First,
we restricted the stochastic process to a certain class to demonstrate how to
consistently change all variables' probability distributions, which affect the
SPPC payoff. Second, we explicitly indicated not only the stochastic processes
of the stock price process and performance variables under the changed
probability, but also how the changes in the performance variables' drift
coefficients related to stock betas. Third, we proposed a convenient model in
application that uses only a few parameters. Fourth, we provided a method to
estimate the parameters and improve the estimation of both the price and

Fe3GeTe2 crystals are metallic ferromagnets with an easy axis perpendicular to
the layers, and a very sharp magnetization switching at magnetic field values
that depend slightly on their geometry. In Fe3GeTe2/hBN/Fe3GeTe2
heterostructures, we observe a textbook behavior of the tunneling resistance,
which is minimum (maximum) when the magnetization in the two electrodes is
parallel (antiparallel) to each other. The magnetoresistance is 160% at low
temperature, from which we determine the spin polarization of Fe3GeTe2 to be
0.66, corresponding to 83% and 17% of majority and minority carriers,
respectively. The measurements also show that, with increasing temperature, the
evolution of the spin polarization extracted from the tunneling
magnetoresistance is proportional to the temperature dependence of the
magnetization extracted from the analysis of the anomalous Hall conductivity.
This suggests that the magnetic properties of the surface are representative of
those of the bulk, as it may be expected for vdW materials.

radiative properties of all the media in which they are present. Their
influence depends on the grain composition, size, and geometrical structure

traced by an enhancement of the FIR emissivity and by cloudshine and coreshine.
We investigate the imprint of the grain characteristics on the dust unpolarised
optical properties from the visible to the FIR for isolated grains and
aggregates. Using optical constants for both carbonaceous and silicate
materials, we derive the absorption and scattering efficiencies, the asymmetry
factor of the phase function, the albedo, and the mass opacity, using either
Mie theory or DDA. We study the effects of the size, porosity and shape of the
grains, and of the monomers constituting the aggregates, on the optical
properties. For aggregates we study the influence of the number of monomers and
of mixing monomer sizes. Grain structure changes result in variations at all
wavelengths. Porosity, grain elongation, and aggregation all produce an
increase in the FIR opacity. The spectral dependence of this increase depends
on the nature of the material composing the grain: it is independent of the
wavelength for insulators but not for conductors. For aggregates, the FIR
increase does not depend on the monomer size and saturates for aggregates
containing 6 or more monomers. For silicates, the MIR spectral feature at 18
microns is more sensitive to the details of the grain structure than the 10
microns feature. This study provides a basis for understanding the range of
variations achievable as a result of varying the grain characteristics. It
emphasises the importance of considering the detailed grain structure in
determining the dust optical properties and of using exact methods.

account for future tasks to be added and thus leave enough capacity for them.
To achieve Selfless Sequential Learning we study different regularization
strategies and activation functions. We find that imposing sparsity at the
level of the representation (i.e.~neuron activations) is more beneficial for
sequential learning than encouraging parameter sparsity. In particular, we
propose a novel regularizer, that encourages representation sparsity by means
of neural inhibition. It results in few active neurons which in turn leaves
more free neurons to be utilized by upcoming tasks. As neural inhibition over
an entire layer can be too drastic, especially for complex tasks requiring
strong representations, our regularizer only inhibits other neurons in a local
neighbourhood, inspired by lateral inhibition processes in the brain. We
combine our novel regularizer, with state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods
that penalize changes to important previously learned parts of the network. We
show that our new regularizer leads to increased sparsity which translates in
consistent performance improvement %over alternative regularizers we studied on

similar to classical dwarf galaxies, but sizes up to $\sim\!5$ larger than
expected for their mass. Some UDGs have large populations of globular clusters
(GCs), something unexpected in galaxies with such low stellar density and mass.
We have carried out a comprehensive study of GCs in both UDGs and classical
dwarf galaxies at comparable stellar masses using HST observations of the Coma
cluster. We present new imaging for 33 Dragonfly UDGs with the largest
effective radii ($>2$ kpc), and additionally include 15 UDGs and 54 classical
dwarf galaxies from the HST/ACS Coma Treasury Survey and the literature. Out of
a total of 48 UDGs, 27 have statistically significant GC systems, and 11 have
candidate nuclear star clusters. The GC specific frequency ($S_N$) varies
dramatically, with the mean $S_N$ being higher for UDGs than for classical
dwarfs. At constant stellar mass, galaxies with larger sizes (or lower surface
brightnesses) have higher $S_N$, with the trend being stronger at higher
stellar mass. At lower stellar masses, UDGs tend to have higher $S_N$ when
closer to the center of the cluster, i.e., in denser environments. The fraction
of UDGs with a nuclear star cluster also depends on environment, varying from
$\sim\!40$\% in the cluster core, where it is slightly lower than the
nucleation fraction of classical dwarfs, to $\lesssim20\%$ in the outskirts.
Collectively, we observe an unmistakable diversity in the abundance of GCs, and
this may point to multiple formation routes.

lightweight cryptographic approach, namely SCOPE, is proposed to consolidate
COPE against the honest-but-curious and malicious attacks. Honest-but-curious
attack serves adversaries who accurately obey the protocol but try to learn as

Malicious attack tries to learn not only the private information but also
modifies the packet on harmful purposes. In our work, the SCOPE protocol is
defensive to the both attacks. The private information in the COPE packet are
encrypted by Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and an additional information
is inserted into SCOPE packets served for the authentication process using the

more planetesimal belts. The belts get dynamically excited, either by planets
('planet stirring') or by embedded big planetesimals ('self-stirring').
Collisions between planetesimals become destructive and start to produce dust,
creating an observable debris disc. Following Kenyon & Bromley (2008), it is
often assumed that self-stirring starts to operate as soon as the first ~1000
km-sized embedded 'Plutos' have formed. However, state-of-the-art pebble
concentration models robustly predict planetesimals between a few km and ~200
km in size to form in protoplanetary discs rapidly, before then slowly growing
into Pluto-sized bodies. We show that the timescale, on which these
planetesimals excite the disc sufficiently for fragmentation, is shorter than
the formation timescale of Plutos. Using an analytic model based on the Ida &
Makino (1993) theory, backed up by numerical integrations, we find the
excitation timescale to be $T_{\rm excite} \approx 100 x_{\rm m}^{-1}
M_*^{-3/2} a^3$ Myr, where $x_{\rm m}$ is the total mass of a protoplanetary
disc progenitor in the units of the Minimum-Mass Solar Nebula, $a$ its radius
in the units of 100 AU, and $M_*$ is the stellar mass in solar masses. These
results are applied to a set of 23 debris discs that have been well resolved
with ALMA or SMA. We find that the majority of these discs are consistent with
being self-stirred. However, three large discs around young early-type stars do
require planets as stirrers. These are 49 Cet, HD 95086, and HR 8799, of which
the latter two are already known to have planets.

$T_{\mathrm c}$, increases up to 12 K for films with compressive strain while
the superconductivity disappears for films with large tensile strains. On the
other hand, the structural (nematic) transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm s}$,
slightly decreases as the in-plane strain is more compressive. This suggests
that the structural transition can be extinguished by a smaller amount of Te
substitution for films with more compressive strain, which may lead to higher
$T_{\mathrm c}$ in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$. It was also found that the carrier
densities evaluated via transport properties increase as the in-plane strain
becomes more compressive. A clear correlation between $T_{\mathrm c}$ and the

traditional analysis using a consistency property of loss functions, it is
known that the expected classification error converges more slowly than the
expected risk even when assuming a low-noise condition on the conditional label
probabilities. Consequently, the resulting rate is sublinear. Therefore, it is
important to consider whether much faster convergence of the expected
classification error can be achieved. In recent research, an exponential
convergence rate for stochastic gradient descent was shown under a strong
low-noise condition but provided theoretical analysis was limited to the
squared loss function, which is somewhat inadequate for binary classification
tasks. In this paper, we show an exponential convergence of the expected
classification error in the final phase of the stochastic gradient descent for
a wide class of differentiable convex loss functions under similar assumptions.
As for the averaged stochastic gradient descent, we show that the same
convergence rate holds from the early phase of training. In experiments, we

arrive that must immediately be forwarded to one of $N$ single-server queues.
We discuss recent advances on scalable load balancing schemes which provide
favorable delay performance when $N$ grows large, and yet only require minimal
implementation overhead. Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) yields vanishing delays
as $N$ grows large, as in a centralized queueing arrangement, but involves a
prohibitive communication burden. In contrast, power-of-$d$ or JSQ($d$) schemes
that assign an incoming task to a server with the shortest queue among $d$
servers selected uniformly at random require little communication, but lead to
constant delays. In order to examine this fundamental trade-off between delay
performance and implementation overhead, we consider JSQ($d(N)$) schemes where
the diversity parameter $d(N)$ depends on $N$ and investigate what growth rate
of $d(N)$ is required to asymptotically match the optimal JSQ performance on
fluid and diffusion scale.
  Stochastic coupling techniques and stochastic-process limits play an
instrumental role in establishing the asymptotic optimality. We demonstrate how
this methodology carries over to infinite-server settings, finite buffers,
multiple dispatchers, servers arranged on graph topologies, and token-based
load balancing including the popular Join-the-Idle-Queue (JIQ) scheme. In this
way we provide a broad overview of the many recent advances in the field. This
survey extends the short review presented at ICM 2018 (arXiv:1712.08555).

helium-like xenon measured at an Electron Beam Ion Trap facility. In a review
paper (H. Chen and P. Beiersdorfer, Can. J. Phys. 86, 55 (2008)), the authors
find a significant effect due to the Breit interaction between the free and the
bound electrons in the excitation process of He-like xenon. The authors state
that the agreement between the measured and calculated cross-section values can
only be found when the generalized Breit interaction is included in the
calculations. We have performed new calculations with a Multi-Configuration
Dirac-Fock code, as well as with the Penn State University suite of codes, and
our conclusions are that the contribution of the Breit interaction is much
lower than found in the calculations presented in the abovementioned article.
In fact, our predictions are subsequently almost twice as large as the
experimental values. We present these considerations in hopes of motivating new
experimental investigations.

its finite basin of attraction. The basin boundary, which separates initial
droplet shapes returning to the non-breaking base state from those becoming
unstable and breaking up, is characterized using edge tracking techniques. We
numerically construct the edge state, a dynamically unstable equilibrium whose
stable manifold forms the basin boundary. The edge state equilibrium controls
if the droplet breaks and selects a unique path towards break-up. This path
physically corresponds to the well-known end-pinching mechanism. Our results

sample of 82 local gas-rich galaxies, including 70 ""dwarf"" galaxies ($M_* <
10^9 M_\odot$), from the Local Volume HI Survey (LVHIS), which is close to
volume limited. It is found that LVHIS galaxies hold a tight linear FIR-radio
correlation (FRC) over four orders of magnitude ($F_{1.4GHz} \propto
F_{FIR}^{1.00\pm0.08}$). However, for detected galaxies only, a trend of larger
FIR-to-radio ratio with decreasing flux density is observed. We estimate the
star formation rate by combining UV and mid-IR data using empirical
calibration. It is confirmed that both FIR and radio emission are strongly
connected with star formation but with significant non-linearity. Dwarf
galaxies are found radiation deficient in both bands, when normalized by star
formation rate. It urges a ""conspiracy"" to keep the FIR-to-radio ratio
generally constant for dwarf galaxies. By using partial correlation coefficient
in Pearson definition, we identify the key galaxy properties associated with
the FIR and radio deficiency. Some major factors, such as stellar mass surface
density, will cancel out when taking the ratio between FIR and radio fluxes.
The remaining factors, such as HI-to-stellar mass ratio and galaxy size, are
expected to cancel each other due to the distribution of galaxies in the
parameter space. Such cancellation is probably responsible for the ""conspiracy""
to keep the FRC alive.

cancer, had a devastating effect on its host, the Tasmanian Devil. Current
estimates of its density are at roughly 20% of the pre-disease state, and
single-population epidemiological models have predicted the likely extinction
of the host. Here we take advantage of extensive surveys across Tasmania
providing data on the spatial and temporal spread of DFTD, and investigate the
dynamics of this host-pathogen system using a spatial metapopulation model. We
first confirm a most likely origin of DFTD in the north-east corner of the
island, and then use the inferred dynamics to predict the fate of the species.
We find that our medium-term predictions match additional data not used for
fitting, and that on the long-term, Tasmanian Devils are predicted to coexist
with the tumour. The key process allowing persistence is the repeated
reinvasion of extinct patches from neighbouring areas where the disease has
flared up and died out, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium with different
levels of spatial heterogeneity. However, this dynamic equilibrium is predicted
to keep this apex predator at about 9 % of its original density, with possible
dramatic effects on the Tasmanian ecosystem.

abnormality detection in medical imaging. We utilize typical, publicly
available datasets with brain scans from healthy subjects and patients with
stroke lesions and brain tumors. We use the data from healthy subjects to train
different auto-encoder based models to learn the distribution of healthy images
and detect pathologies as outliers. Models that can better learn the data
distribution should be able to detect outliers more accurately. We evaluate the
detection performance of deep generative models and compare them with non-deep
learning based approaches to provide a benchmark of the current state of
research. We conclude that abnormality detection is a challenging task for deep
generative models and large room exists for improvement. In order to facilitate
further research, we aim to provide carefully pre-processed imaging data

analysis. It is commonly assumed that samples of the functional predictor are
independent realizations of an underlying stochastic process, and are observed
over a grid of points contaminated by i.i.d. measurement errors. In practice,
however, the dynamical dependence across different curves may exist and the
parametric assumption on the error covariance structure could be unrealistic.
In this paper, we consider functional linear regression with serially dependent
observations of the functional predictor, when the contamination of the
predictor by the white noise is genuinely functional with fully nonparametric
covariance structure. Inspired by the fact that the autocovariance function of
observed functional predictors automatically filters out the impact from the
unobservable noise term, we propose a novel autocovariance-based generalized
method-of-moments estimate of the slope function. We also develop a
nonparametric smoothing approach to handle the scenario of partially observed
functional predictors. The asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators
under different scenarios are established. Finally, we demonstrate that our

achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of problems. Many companies
employ resources and money to generate these models and provide them as an API,
therefore it is in their best interest to protect them, i.e., to avoid that
someone else copies them. Recent studies revealed that state-of-the-art CNNs
are vulnerable to adversarial examples attacks, and this weakness indicates
that CNNs do not need to operate in the problem domain (PD). Therefore, we
hypothesize that they also do not need to be trained with examples of the PD in
order to operate in it.
  Given these facts, in this paper, we investigate if a target black-box CNN
can be copied by persuading it to confess its knowledge through random
non-labeled data. The copy is two-fold: i) the target network is queried with
random data and its predictions are used to create a fake dataset with the
knowledge of the network; and ii) a copycat network is trained with the fake
dataset and should be able to achieve similar performance as the target
network.
  This hypothesis was evaluated locally in three problems (facial expression,
object, and crosswalk classification) and against a cloud-based API. In the
copy attacks, images from both non-problem domain and PD were used. All copycat
networks achieved at least 93.7% of the performance of the original models with
non-problem domain data, and at least 98.6% using additional data from the PD.
Additionally, the copycat CNN successfully copied at least 97.3% of the
performance of the Microsoft Azure Emotion API. Our results show that it is
possible to create a copycat CNN by simply querying a target network as
black-box with random non-labeled data.

anisotropy is characterized by a control parameter $\eta$ measuring the ratio
of interaction energy along the two lattice directions. The simplicity of the
model allows us to study systematically the effect and interplay between
$\eta$, the nearest-neighbor interaction energy $E_{n}$, and the flux rate $F$,
on the shapes and the fractal dimension $D_{f}$ of clusters before coalescence.
At finite particle flux $F$ we observe the emergence of rod-like and
needle-shaped clusters whose aspect ratio $R$ depends on $\eta$, $E_{n}$ and
$F$. In the regime of strong interaction anisotropy, the cluster aspect ratio
shows power-law scaling as function of particle flux, $R \sim F^{- \alpha}$.
Furthermore, the evolution of the cluster length and width also exhibit
power-law scaling with universal growth exponents for all considered values of
$F$. We identify a critical cluster length $L_{c}$ that marks a transition from
one-dimensional to self-similar two-dimensional cluster growth. Moreover, we

implementing balanced homodyne readout scheme and for a particular choice of

achieved by picking the local oscillator from interferometer reflection

and giant planets. Their predictions are thought to be less reliable at young
ages ($<$ 200 Myr) and in the low-mass regime ($\mathrm{<1~M_{\odot}}$). GJ
2060 AB and TWA 22 AB are two rare astrometric M-dwarf binaries respectively
members of the AB Doradus and Beta Pictoris moving groups. As their dynamical
mass can be measured within a few years, they can be used to calibrate the
evolutionary tracks and set new constraints on the age of young moving groups.
We find a total mass of $\mathrm{0.18\pm 0.02~M_\odot}$ for TWA 22. That mass
is in good agreement with model predictions at the age of the Beta Pic moving
group. We obtain a total mass of $\mathrm{1.09 \pm 0.10~M_{\odot}}$ for GJ
2060. We estimate a spectral type of M$1\pm0.5$,
$\mathrm{L/L_{\odot}=-1.20\pm0.05}$ dex, and $\mathrm{T_{eff}=3700\pm100}$ K
for GJ 2060 A. The B component is a M$3\pm0.5$ dwarf with
$\mathrm{L/L_{\odot}=-1.63\pm0.05}$ dex and $\mathrm{T_{eff}=3400\pm100}$ K.
The dynamical mass of GJ 2060 AB is inconsistent with the most recent models
predictions (BCAH15, PARSEC) for an ABDor age in the range 50-150 Myr. It is 10
to 20\% (1-2 sigma, depending on the assumed age) above the models predictions,
corresponding to an underestimation of $0.10$ to $0.20~\mathrm{M_\odot}$.
Coevality suggests a young age for the system ($\sim$ 50 Myr) according to most
evolutionary models. TWA 22 validates the predictions of recent evolutionary
tracks at $\sim$20 Myr. On the other hand, we evidence a 1-2 sigma mismatch
between the predicted and observed mass of GJ 2060 AB. This slight departure
may indicate that one of the star hosts a tight companion. Alternatively, this
would confirm the models tendency to underestimate the mass of young low-mass
stars.

  via function approximation",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical algorithms in numerical analysis for numerical integration
(quadrature/cubature) follow the principle of approximate and integrate: the
integrand is approximated by a simple function (e.g. a polynomial), which is
then integrated exactly. In high-dimensional integration, such methods quickly
become infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. A common alternative is
the Monte Carlo method (MC), which simply takes the average of random samples,
improving the estimate as more and more samples are taken. The main issue with
MC is its slow (though dimension-independent) convergence, and various
techniques have been proposed to reduce the variance. In this work we suggest a
numerical analyst's interpretation of MC: it approximates the integrand with a
constant function, and integrates that constant exactly. This observation leads
naturally to MC-like methods where the approximant is a non-constant function,
for example low-degree polynomials, sparse grids or low-rank functions. We show
that these methods have the same $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ asymptotic convergence as in
MC, but with reduced variance, equal to the quality of the underlying function
approximation. We also discuss methods that improve the approximation quality
as more samples are taken, and thus can converge faster than $O(1/\sqrt{N})$.
The main message is that techniques in high-dimensional approximation theory
can be combined with Monte Carlo integration to accelerate convergence.

contentious issue and the topic of much debate. In this paper we focus on
cricket and examine what conclusions may be drawn about the ranking of Test
batsmen using data on batting scores from the first Test in 1877 onwards. The
overlapping nature of playing careers is exploited to form a bridge from past
to present so that all players can be compared simultaneously, rather than just
relative to their contemporaries. The natural variation in runs scored by a
batsman is modelled by an additive log-linear model with year, age and
cricket-specific components used to extract the innate ability of an individual
cricketer. Incomplete innings are handled via censoring and a zero-inflated
component is incorporated into the model to allow for an excess of frailty at
the start of an innings. The innings-by-innings variation of runs scored by
each batsman leads to uncertainty in their ranking position. A Bayesian
approach is used to fit the model and realisations from the posterior
distribution are obtained by deploying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
Posterior summaries of innate player ability are then used to assess
uncertainty in ranking position and this is contrasted with rankings determined
via the posterior mean runs scored. Posterior predictive checks show that the
model provides a reasonably accurate description of runs scored.

of the candidates is a shock wave driven by a coronal mass ejection, which is
thought to accelerate particles via diffusive-shock acceleration. We perform
physics-based simulations of proton acceleration using information on the shock
and ambient plasma parameters derived from the observation of a real GLE event.
We analyse the simulation results with the aim to find out which of the
parameters are significant in controlling the acceleration efficiency and to
get a better understanding of the conditions under which the shock can produce
relativistic protons. We use results of the recently developed technique to
determine the shock and ambient plasma parameters, applied to the 17 May 2012
GLE event, and carry out proton acceleration simulations with the Coronal Shock
Acceleration model. We have performed proton acceleration simulations for nine
individual magnetic field lines characterised by various plasma conditions.
Analysis of the simulation results shows that the acceleration efficiency of
the shock, i.e., its ability to accelerate particles to high energies, tends to
be higher for those shock portions that are characterised by larger values of
the scattering-centre compression ratio and/or the fast-mode Mach number. At
the same time, the acceleration efficiency can be strengthened due to enhanced
plasma density in the flux tube. Analysis of the delays between the flare onset
and the production times of protons of 1 GV rigidity for different field lines
in our simulations, and a subsequent comparison of those with the observed
values indicate a possibility that quasi-perpendicular portions of the shock
play the main role in producing relativistic protons.

the problem of optimal mass transportation. Roughly speaking, they measure the
minimal effort required to reconfigure the probability mass of one distribution
in order to recover the other distribution. They are ubiquitous in mathematics,
with a long history that has seen them catalyse core developments in analysis,
optimization, and probability. Beyond their intrinsic mathematical richness,
they possess attractive features that make them a versatile tool for the
statistician: they can be used to derive weak convergence and convergence of
moments, and can be easily bounded; they are well-adapted to quantify a natural
notion of perturbation of a probability distribution; and they seamlessly
incorporate the geometry of the domain of the distributions in question, thus
being useful for contrasting complex objects. Consequently, they frequently
appear in the development of statistical theory and inferential methodology,
and have recently become an object of inference in themselves. In this review,
we provide a snapshot of the main concepts involved in Wasserstein distances
and optimal transportation, and a succinct overview of some of their many
statistical aspects.

general purpose framework for quantifying the degree of importance of specific
factors of influence in deep neural networks as well as for actively promoting

multitask learning as well as training with auxiliary and adversarial losses.
We apply neural stethoscopes to analyse the state-of-the-art neural network for
stability prediction. We show that the baseline model is susceptible to being
misled by incorrect visual cues. This leads to a performance breakdown to the
level of random guessing when training on scenarios where visual cues are
inversely correlated with stability. Using stethoscopes to promote meaningful
feature extraction increases performance from 51% to 90% prediction accuracy.
Conversely, training on an easy dataset where visual cues are positively
correlated with stability, the baseline model learns a bias leading to poor
performance on a harder dataset. Using an adversarial stethoscope, the network
is successfully de-biased, leading to a performance increase from 66% to 88%.

systematically study the evolution of the effective Coulomb interactions

that the response upon strain is strongly dependent on the material. For
LaTiO3, the interaction parameters are determined by the degree of localization
of the orbitals, and grow with increasing tensile strain. In contrast, LaCrO3
shows the opposite trends: the interactions parameters shrink upon tensile
strain. This is caused by the enhanced screening due to the larger electron
filling. LaVO3 shows an intermediate behavior.

assessment of the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and
network architecture complexity of a deep neural network, which is important

this diverse set of networks are presented in this study to act as a reference

proportion of POI-relevant and POI-irrelevant tweets, the proposed algorithm
demonstrates much higher clustering performance than the DBSCAN case in terms
of $\mathcal{F}_1$ score and its variants. While DBSTexC performs exactly as
DBSCAN with the textually homogeneous inputs, it far outperforms DBSCAN with
the textually heterogeneous inputs. Furthermore, to further improve the
clustering quality by fully capturing the geographic distribution of tweets, we
present fuzzy DBSTexC (F-DBSTexC), an extension of DBSTexC, which incorporates
the notion of fuzzy clustering into the DBSTexC. We then demonstrate the

decoded efficiently using a message-passing algorithm. In the original LDLC
decoder, the message exchanged between variable nodes and check nodes are
continuous functions, which must be approximated in practice. A promising
method is Gaussian approximation (GA), where the messages are approximated by
Gaussian functions. However, current GA-based decoders share two weaknesses:
firstly, the convergence of these approximate decoders is unproven; secondly,
the best known decoder requires $O(2^d)$ operations at each variable node,
where $d$ is the degree of LDLC. It means that existing decoders are very slow
for long codes with large $d$. The contribution of this paper is twofold:
firstly, we prove that all GA-based LDLC decoders converge sublinearly (or
faster) in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region; secondly, we propose a
novel GA-based LDLC decoder which requires only $O(d)$ operations at each

methods to convert the per pixel probability maps to final desired outputs.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to make the semantic
segmentation network output to be more realistic or better
structure-preserving, decreasing the dependency on potentially complex
post-processing. In this work, we propose EL-GAN: a GAN framework to mitigate
the discussed problem using an embedding loss. With EL-GAN, we discriminate
based on learned embeddings of both the labels and the prediction at the same
time. This results in more stable training due to having better discriminative
information, benefiting from seeing both `fake' and `real' predictions at the

use the TuSimple lane marking challenge to demonstrate that with our proposed

to the labels when compared to conventional methods, the subsequent
post-processing is also simpler and crosses the competitive 96% accuracy

(0.5-10 keV energy band) of about 3 deg x 3 deg around the GC with the
XMM-Newton observatory we conducted a systematic search for transient X-ray
sources. Promising systems were analyzed for spectral, timing, and
multi-wavelength properties to constrain their nature. We discovered a new
highly variable (factor $\mathrm{\gtrsim{20}}$) X-ray source about 1.25 deg
south of the GC. We found evidence making the newly discovered system a
candidate IP. The X-ray light curve shows a period of $\mathrm{511\pm10 s}$
which can be interpreted as the spin period of the WD. The X-ray spectrum is
well fit by a bremsstrahlung model with a temperature of $\mathrm{13.9\pm2.5
keV}$, suggesting a WD mass of $\mathrm{0.4-0.5 M_\odot}$. Among many
candidates we could not identify a blue optical counterpart as would be
expected for IPs. The high X-ray absorption and absence of a clear optical
counterpart suggest that the source is most likely located in the GB. This
would make the system a transient IP (GK Per class) with especially high peak
X-ray luminosity and therefore a very faint X-ray transient (VFXT).

Shimokawa-Han-Amari's hypothesis testing scheme with Borade's unequal error
protection (UEP) for channel coding. A separate source channel coding
architecture is employed. The resulting exponent is optimal for the newly
introduced class of \emph{generalized testing against conditional
independence}. When communication is over a MAC or a BC, our scheme combines
hybrid coding with UEP. The resulting error exponent over the MAC is optimal in
the case of generalized testing against conditional independence with
independent observations at the two sensors, when the MAC decomposes into two
individual DMCs. In this case, separate source-channel coding is sufficient;
this same conclusion holds also under arbitrarily correlated sensor
observations when testing is against independence. For the BC, the error
exponents region of hybrid coding with UEP exhibits a tradeoff between the
exponents attained at the two decision centers. When both receivers aim at
maximizing the error exponents under different hypotheses and the marginal
distributions of the sensors' observations are different under these
hypotheses, then this tradeoff can be mitigated with the following strategy.
The sensor makes a tentative guess on the hypothesis, submits this guess, and
applies our coding and testing scheme for the DMC only for the decision center
that is not interested in maximizing the exponent under the guessed hypothesis.

rational economic thinking, human decision-making processes are influenced by
social preferences, such as an inclination to fairness. In this study we
suggest that the apparent gap between competitive and altruistic human

their status, i.e., a utility function different from simple profit
maximisation. To this end we analyse a simple agent-based model, where
individuals play the repeated dictator game in a social network they can
modify. As model parameters we consider the living costs and the rate at which
agents forget infractions by others. We find that individual strategies used in
the game vary greatly, from selfish to selfless, and that both of the above
parameters determine when individuals form complex and cohesive social

resources, and various conjectures regarding their role in DQC1's performance
advantage. Coherence and discord are prominent candidates, respectively
characterizing non-classicality within localized and correlated systems. Here
we realize DQC1 within a superconducting system, engineered such that the
dynamics of coherence and discord can be tracked throughout its execution. We
experimentally confirm that DQC1 acts as a resource converter, consuming
coherence to generate discord during its operation. Our results highlight
superconducting circuits as a promising platform for both realizing DQC1 and

controlled bots, also known as non player characters, can often be easily
distinguishable from those controlled by humans. Tell-tale signs such as failed
navigation, ""sixth sense"" knowledge of human players' whereabouts and
deterministic, scripted behaviors are some of the causes of this. We propose,
however, that one of the biggest indicators of non humanlike behavior in these
games can be found in the weapon shooting capability of the bot. Consistently
perfect accuracy and ""locking on"" to opponents in their visual field from any
distance are indicative capabilities of bots that are not found in human
players. Traditionally, the bot is handicapped in some way with either a timed
reaction delay or a random perturbation to its aim, which doesn't adapt or
improve its technique over time. We hypothesize that enabling the bot to learn
the skill of shooting through trial and error, in the same way a human player
learns, will lead to greater variation in game-play and produce less
predictable non player characters. This paper describes a reinforcement
learning shooting mechanism for adapting shooting over time based on a dynamic
reward signal from the amount of damage caused to opponents.

the experimental data for the first 2$^+$ state and the isoscalar giant
quadrupole resonance. It is found that the first $2^+$ state and the low-energy
quadrupole states between 3 and 6 MeV display an opposite behavior with
increasing neutron number. While the strength of the first $2^+$ state
decreases, some excited states start to accumulate between 3 and 6 MeV, and
increase their strength with increasing neutron number. This low-energy region
between 3 and 6 MeV is quite sensitive to the changes in the shell structure
with increasing neutron number. In particular, between $^{116}$Sn and
$^{132}$Sn, the filling of the neutron orbitals with large values of $j$, has
an important impact on the low-energy region. Our analysis shows that the
low-energy states have a non-collective character, except the first 2$^+$

interesting pattern: with the increase of the neutron number, their strength
increases and their nature changes, namely they switch from proton excitations

detection and diagnosis of various cardiac disease. It aims at identifying
regional wall motions into one of the four types including normal, hypokinetic,
akinetic, and dyskinetic, and is extremely challenging due to the complex
myocardium deformation and subtle inter-class difference of motion patterns.
All existing work on automated motion analysis are focused on binary
abnormality detection to avoid the much more demanding motion scoring, which is
urgently required in real clinical practice yet has never been investigated
before. In this work, we propose Cardiac-MOS, the first powerful method for
cardiac motion scoring from cardiac MR sequences based on deep convolution
neural network. Due to the locality of convolution, the relationship between
distant non-local responses of the feature map cannot be explored, which is
closely related to motion difference between segments. In Cardiac-MOS, such
non-local relationship is modeled with non-local neural network within each
segment and across all segments of one subject, i.e., segment- and
subject-level non-local modeling, and lead to obvious performance improvement.
Besides, Cardiac-MOS can effectively extract motion information from MR
sequences of various lengths by interpolating the convolution kernel along the
temporal dimension, therefore can be applied to MR sequences of multiple
sources. Experiments on 1440 myocardium segments of 90 subjects from short axis
MR sequences of multiple lengths prove that Cardiac-MOS achieves reliable
performance, with correlation of 0.926 for motion score index estimation and
accuracy of 77.4\% for motion scoring. Cardiac-MOS also outperforms all
existing work for binary abnormality detection. As the first automatic motion
scoring solution, Cardiac-MOS demonstrates great potential in future clinical
application.

estimation of heights, widths, areas, and so on for the vertebral body and
disc) is of the utmost importance in clinical spinal disease diagnoses, such as
osteoporosis, intervertebral disc degeneration, and lumbar disc herniation, yet
still an unprecedented challenge due to the variety of spine structure and the
high dimensionality of indices to be estimated. In this paper, we propose a
novel cascade amplifier regression network (CARN), which includes the CARN
architecture and local shape-constrained manifold regularization (LSCMR) loss
function, to achieve accurate direct automated multiple indices estimation. The
CARN architecture is composed of a cascade amplifier network (CAN) for
expressive feature embedding and a linear regression model for multiple indices
estimation. The CAN consists of cascade amplifier units (AUs), which are used
for selective feature reuse by stimulating effective feature and suppressing
redundant feature during propagating feature map between adjacent layers, thus
an expressive feature embedding is obtained. During training, the LSCMR is
utilized to alleviate overfitting and generate realistic estimation by learning

stability of the three-phase interstellar medium using three-dimensional
simulations of a $1$ kpc$^2$, vertically-extended domain. The FUV heating rate
sets the range of thermal pressures across which the cold ($\sim10^2$ K) and
warm ($\sim10^4$ K) neutral media (CNM and WNM) can coexist in equilibrium.
Even absent a variable star formation rate regulating the FUV heating rate, the
gas physics keeps the pressure in the two-phase regime: because radiative
heating and cooling processes happen on shorter timescales than sound wave
propagation, turbulent compressions tend to keep the interstellar medium within
the CNM-WNM pressure regime over a wide range of heating rates. The thermal
pressure is set primarily by the heating rate with little influence from the
hydrostatics. The vertical velocity dispersion adjusts as needed to provide
hydrostatic support given the thermal pressure: when the turbulent pressure
$\langle\rho\rangle\sigma_z^2$ is calculated over scales $\gtrsim500$ pc, the
thermal plus turbulent pressure approximately equals the weight of the gas. The
warm gas volume filling fraction is $0.2<f_w<0.8$ over a factor of less than
three in heating rate, with $f_w$ near unity at higher heating rates and near
zero at lower heating rates. We suggest that cosmological simulations that do
not resolve the CNM should maintain an interstellar thermal pressure within the
two-phase regime.

breaks time-reversal symmetry. Since its proposal, explorations of AFTI in
strong-correlated systems are still lacking. In this paper, we show for the
first time that a novel AFTI phase can be realized in three-dimensional
topological Kondo insulator (TKI). In a wide parameter region, the ground
states of TKI undergo a second-order transition to antiferromagnetic insulating
phases which conserve a combined symmetry of time reversal and a lattice
translation, allowing us to derive a $\mathcal{Z}_2$-classification formula for
these states. By calculating the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ index, the antiferromagnetic
insulating states are classified into (AFTI) or non-topological
antiferromagnetic insulator (nAFI) in different parameter regions. On the
antiferromagnetic surfaces in AFTI, we find topologically protected gapless
Dirac cones inside the bulk gap, leading to metallic Fermi rings exhibiting
helical spin texture with weak spin-momentum locking. Depending on model
parameters, the magnetic transitions take place either between AFTI and strong
topological insulator, or between nAFI and weak topological insulator. By
varying some model parameters, we find a topological transition between AFTI
and nAFI, driving by closing of bulk gap. Our work may account for the
pressure-induced magnetism in TKI compound SmB$_6$, and helps to explore richer
AFTI phases in heavy-fermion systems as well as in other strong-correlated

interpolation. In each step of a dynamic programming time-stepping we
approximate the value function with Chebyshev polynomials. The key advantage of
this approach is that it allows to shift the model-dependent computations into
an offline phase prior to the time-stepping. In the offline part a family of
generalised (conditional) moments is computed by an appropriate numerical
technique such as a Monte Carlo, PDE or Fourier transform based method. Thanks
to this methodological flexibility the approach applies to a large variety of
models. Online, the backward induction is solved on a discrete Chebyshev grid,
and no (conditional) expectations need to be computed. For each time step the
method delivers a closed form approximation of the price function along with
the options' delta and gamma. Moreover, the same family of (conditional)
moments yield multiple outputs including the option prices for different
strikes, maturities and different payoff profiles. We provide a theoretical
error analysis and find conditions that imply explicit error bounds for a
variety of stock price models. Numerical experiments confirm the fast
convergence of prices and sensitivities. An empirical investigation of accuracy
and runtime also shows an efficiency gain compared with the least-square
Monte-Carlo method introduced by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001).

essential building block of a large family of soft smart materials. In neat
water it undergoes upon heating at $\approx$305K a phase transition from
swollen to collapsed state. This interesting polymer behavior has been subject
to a large number of computer modelling studies, mostly described with original
OPLS force field suggested in the first works, where qualitatively correct
behavior was observed. Nevertheless, employing converged replica exchange
molecular dynamics simulations, we have shown on PNIPAM 30mer that this widely
used force-field can not describe the phase transition thermodynamics. We found
that the reason is a poor balance of hydrophobic-polar character of the
polymer. We have developed and tested three new force fields OPLS1.2x, QM1, and
QM2, which all exhibit two state behavior, and reasonably reproduce
experimental lower critical solution temperature and transition thermodynamics.
The best performance was found for QM2, which is suggested for future PNIPAM
studies. Finally, the effect of polymer chain length on collapse transition
thermodynamics was investigated by simulations of 20, 30 and 40mer chains.
Consistent with experimental data, the transition enthalpy per monomer unit is
only weakly increasing with the chain length. However, the calculated
transition enthalpy is around times smaller than the experimental calorimetry
value.

based on consistency regularization, whereby a model is trained to be robust to
small perturbations of its inputs and parameters. To understand consistency
regularization, we conceptually explore how loss geometry interacts with
training procedures. The consistency loss dramatically improves generalization
performance over supervised-only training; however, we show that SGD struggles
to converge on the consistency loss and continues to make large steps that lead
to changes in predictions on the test data. Motivated by these observations, we
propose to train consistency-based methods with Stochastic Weight Averaging
(SWA), a recent approach which averages weights along the trajectory of SGD
with a modified learning rate schedule. We also propose fast-SWA, which further
accelerates convergence by averaging multiple points within each cycle of a
cyclical learning rate schedule. With weight averaging, we achieve the best
known semi-supervised results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, over many different
quantities of labeled training data. For example, we achieve 5.0% error on
CIFAR-10 with only 4000 labels, compared to the previous best result in the

revealing the delivered message index to the user. The information theoretic

absence of high-redshift dusty galaxies, with existing redshift distributions
peaking around $z\sim1.5-2.5$. This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty
systems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early
Universe was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward
evolution galaxy model described by Casey et al. (2018) to the ALMA regime (in
depth and area) and determine that the measured number counts and redshift
distributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully consistent with
constraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at $z<2.5$ determined by
single-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger
angular scales ($\sim1-10$deg$^{2}$). We find that measured 1.1-1.3mm number
counts are most constraining for the measurement of the faint-end slope of the
IRLF at $z<2.5$ instead of the prevalence of dusty galaxies at $z>4$. Recent
studies have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at $z>4$ may be particularly
dust-poor, but we find their millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out
consistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law even by assuming relatively
typical, cold-dust ($T_{\rm dust}\approx30\,$K) SEDs. Our models suggest that
the design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the
prevalence of $z>4$ early Universe obscured starbursts. The most promising
avenue for detection and characterization of such early dusty galaxies will
come from future ALMA 2mm blank field surveys covering a few hundred
arcmin$^{2}$ and the combination of existing and future dual-purpose 3mm

the success of these semiempirical molecular orbital models and to develop
further improvements on them. The NDDO approximation provides a recipe to
approximate electron-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) in a symmetrically

in both bases for a selection of molecules and for a selection of basis sets.
We find that the errors in Hartree-Fock and second-order Moller-Plesset

formation of parton showers. Mass effects are not well understood when parton
branching occurs in nuclear matter, such as the quark-gluon plasma. Recently, a
theoretically consistent picture of open heavy flavor production in ultra
relativistic nuclear collisions has begun to emerge based on effective theories
of QCD, such as soft collinear effective theory with Glauber gluons. We show
that implementation of in-medium splitting processes containing heavy quarks
into next-to-leading order calculations of heavy flavor production leads to
larger cross section suppression when compared to traditional energy loss
phenomenology. To better constrain the important mass dependence of in-medium
splitting functions, we propose a new measurement in relativistic heavy ion
collisions, based on a two-prong structure inside a reconstructed heavy flavor
jet. In the region of jet transverse momenta where parton mass effects are
leading, we predict a unique reversal of the mass hierarchy of jet quenching
effects in heavy ion relative to proton collisions. We find that the momentum
sharing distribution of prompt $b$-tagged jets is more strongly modified in
comparison to the one for light jets. The work summarized here opens new
directions of research on the substructure of heavy flavor jets.

four polarization modes, the plus $h_{+}$, cross $h_{\times}$, breathing
$h_{b}$, and longitudinal $h_{L}$ modes. The scalar polarizations $h_b$ and

demonstrate how an unknown overall phase depending on energy and angle mixes

  Analysis for System Design in Complex Environment","6 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Successful engineering requires environmentally adapted procedural and
architectural approaches. While dealing with complicated issues has become an
engineering standard mastering uncertainties in complex environment is still a
major issue. Global trends, such as an increasing rate of disruptive technology
changes or merging of technology fields, however, enforce the importance of
this complex habitat. Missing experience in unknown technological territory
faces engineers with two questions of paramount importance: 1) How can the best
architectural solution within the space of potential alternatives be
identified? 2) How can a proof-of-concept for considered solutions prior
implementation be provided? Mastering lack of knowledge related risks and
uncertainties states one of the most prominent tasks in according projects. The
paper presents a novel methodology of system design in complex environment
called Hyper Space Exploration (HSE). The HSE approach combines methods of
virtual prototyping with those of design of virtual experiments based studies
for statistical learning. Virtual prototyping allows an early feedback on
system behavior with a proof-of-concept prior implementation. Statistical
learning enables system architects to systematically build up the space of
potential solution alternatives, model the effects of design and use-case
variables on target indicators in complex territory, quantify target indicator
trade-offs and finally identify Pareto-optimal system solutions. The first part
of the paper characterizes engineering challenges in complex environment.
Section two presents the HSE methodology with its two major constituents work
flow and tool chain. Section three outlines first successful HSE applications
that already proved its capabilities and universality. Final section four gives
an outlook to further HSE applications as well as methodological future HSE
extensions.

detection schemes usually rely on local spectroscopy or interference through
the Josephson effect. Here, we theoretically study the magnetic response of a
two-dimensional cone of Majorana fermions localized at the surface of class
DIII Topological Superconductors. For a field parallel to the surface the
Zeeman term vanishes and the orbital term induces a Doppler shift of the
Andreev levels resulting in a tilting of the surface Majorana cone. For fields
larger than a critical threshold field $H^*$ the system undergoes a transition
from type I to type II Dirac-Majorana cone. In a spherical geometry the surface
curvature leads to the emergence of the Majorana spin connection in the tilting
term via an interplay between orbital and Zeeman, that generates a finite
non-trivial coupling between negative and positive energy states. Majorana
modes are thus expected to show a finite response to the applied field, that
acquires a universal character in finite geometries and opens the way to
detection of Majorana modes via time-dependent magnetic fields.

node does not depend on where it came from. Recent studies of data on actual

memory in paths does have considerable impact on central methods in network

that conventional network representations disregard. Here we summarise the
progress in this area and outline remaining challenges calling for more

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1802.00591",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Silicene has shown great application potential as a versatile material for
nanoelectronics, particularly promising as building block for spintronic
applications. Unfortunately, despite its intriguing properties, such as
relatively large spin-orbit interactions, one of the biggest hurdles for
silicene to be useful as a host spintronic material is the lack of magnetism or
the topological phase transition owing to the silicene-substrate interactions,
which influence its fundamental properties and has yet to be fully explored.
Here, we show that when silicene is grown on CeO2 substrate, an appreciable
robust magnetic moment appears in silicene covalently bonded to CeO2 (111),
while a topological phase transition to a band insulator occurs regardless of
van der Waals (vdWs) interaction or covalent bonding interaction at interface.
The induced magnetism of silicene is due to the breaking of Si-Si
{\pi}-bonding, also resulting in trivial topological phase. The
silicene-substrate interaction, even weak vdWs force (equivalent to an electric
field), can destroy quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) of silicene. We propose a
viable strategy --- constructing inverse symmetrical sandwich structure
(protective layer/silicene/substrate) --- to preserve quantum spin Hall (QSH)
state of silicene in weak vdWs interaction system. This work takes a critical
step towards fundamental physics and realistic applications of silicene-based
spintronic devices.

constant magnetic field for a silicon-strip tracker. Substantial increases of
momentum resolution respect to standard fit is obtained. The key point is the
use of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).
Two different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an
effective variance for each hit, the second method implements the maximum
likelihood search. The tracker model is similar to the PAMELA tracker. Each
side, of the two sided of the PAMELA detectors, is simulated as momentum
reconstruction device. One of the two is similar to silicon micro-strip
detectors of large use in running experiments. Two different position
reconstructions are used for the standard fits, the $\eta$-algorithm (the best
one) and the two-strip center of gravity. The gain obtained in momentum
resolution is measured as the virtual magnetic field and the virtual
signal-to-noise ratio required by the two standard fits to reach an overlap
with the best of two new methods. For the best side, the virtual magnetic field
must be increased 1.5 times respect to the real field to reach the overlap and
1.8 for the other. For the high noise side, the increases must be 1.8 and 2.0.
The signal-to-noise ratio has similar increases but only for the
$\eta$-algorithm. The signal-to-noise ratio has no effect on the fits with the
center of gravity. Very important results are obtained if the number N of
detecting layers is increased, our methods provide a momentum resolution
growing linearly with N, much higher than standard fits that grow as the
$\sqrt{N}$.

(also called tight wavelet frames) are of importance in wavelet analysis and
applied sciences due to their many desirable properties in applications such as
image processing and numerical algorithms. Tight framelets are often derived
from particular refinable functions satisfying certain stringent conditions.
Consequently, a large family of refinable functions cannot be used to construct
tight framelets. This motivates us to introduce the notion of a quasi-tight
framelet, which is a dual framelet but behaves almost like a tight framelet. It
turns out that the study of quasi-tight framelets is intrinsically linked to
the problem of the generalized matrix spectral factorization for matrices of
Laurent polynomials. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation on
the generalized matrix spectral factorization problem and compactly supported
quasi-tight framelets. As an application of our results on generalized matrix
spectral factorization for matrices of Laurent polynomials, we prove in this
paper that from any arbitrary compactly supported refinable function in
$L_2(R)$, we can always construct a compactly supported one-dimensional
quasi-tight framelet having the minimum number of generators and the highest
possible order of vanishing moments. Our proofs are constructive and
supplemented by step-by-step algorithms. Several examples of quasi-tight
framelets will be provided to illustrate the theoretical results and algorithms
developed in this paper.

Neural Networks (NNs), hardware accelerators emerge as a promising solution.
However, with technology node scaling below 10nm, hardware accelerators become
more susceptible to faults, which in turn can impact the NN accuracy. In this
paper, we study the resilience aspects of Register-Transfer Level (RTL) model
of NN accelerators, in particular, fault characterization and mitigation. By
following a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) approach, first, we characterize the
vulnerability of various components of RTL NN. We observed that the severity of
faults depends on both i) application-level specifications, i.e., NN data
(inputs, weights, or intermediate), NN layers, and NN activation functions, and
ii) architectural-level specifications, i.e., data representation model and the
parallelism degree of the underlying accelerator. Second, motivated by
characterization results, we present a low-overhead fault mitigation technique
that can efficiently correct bit flips, by 47.3% better than state-of-the-art
methods.

can be effectively modeled through a directed network, where the nodes

with this theme and discusses the concentration of a market. A
cross-shareholding matrix is considered, along with two key factors: the node
out-degree distribution which represents the diversification of investments in
terms of the number of involved companies, and the node in-degree distribution
which reports the integration of a company due to the sales of its own shares
to other companies. While diversification is widely explored in the literature,
integration is most present in literature on contagions. This paper captures
such quantities of interest in the two frameworks and studies the stochastic
dependence of diversification and integration through a copula approach. We
adopt entropies as measures for assessing the concentration in the market. The
main question is to assess the dependence structure leading to a better
description of the data or to market polarization (minimal entropy) or market
fairness (maximal entropy). In so doing, we derive information on the way in
which the in- and out-degrees should be connected in order to shape the market.
The question is of interest to regulators bodies, as witnessed by specific
alert threshold published on the US mergers guidelines for limiting the
possibility of acquisitions and the prevalence of a single company on the
market. Indeed, all countries and the EU have also rules or guidelines in order
to limit concentrations, in a country or across borders, respectively. The
calibration of copulas and model parameters on the basis of real data serves as
an illustrative application of the theoretical proposal.

\textit{et. al.}, OL 40, 3316 (2015)]. Unexpectedly, the freshly fabricated Si
devices showed large losses of 5 dB/cm, originating from absorption by free
carriers, accumulated under the positively charged Si$_3$N$_4$ loading layer.
We use 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) light exposures to neutralize progressively and
permanently silicon nitride's bulk charge associated with diamagnetic
K+defects. This in turn leads to a net decrease of electron concentration in
the SOI layer, reducing thus the propagation loss down to 0.9 dB/cm. Detailed
MOS-capacitance measurements on test samples were performed to monitor the
UV-induced modification of the electronic properties of the system. The
evolution of loss mitigation was directly monitored both by Beer-Lambert
approach in waveguide transmission experiments, as well as through more
accurate cavity linewidth measurements. In the last case, we demonstrate how
intrinsic cavity $Q$'s boost from 60,0000 to up to 500,000 after UV treatment.
