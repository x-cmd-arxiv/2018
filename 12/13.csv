  Clinical Neuroimaging Data","Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL 2019)",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Normative modeling has recently been introduced as a promising approach for
modeling variation of neuroimaging measures across individuals in order to
derive biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. Current implementations rely on
Gaussian process regression, which provides coherent estimates of uncertainty
needed for the method but also suffers from drawbacks including poor scaling to
large datasets and a reliance on fixed parametric kernels. In this paper, we
propose a deep normative modeling framework based on neural processes (NPs) to
solve these problems. To achieve this, we define a stochastic process
formulation for mixed-effect models and show how NPs can be adopted for
spatially structured mixed-effect modeling of neuroimaging data. This enables
us to learn optimal feature representations and covariance structure for the
random-effect and noise via global latent variables. In this scheme, predictive
uncertainty can be approximated by sampling from the distribution of these
global latent variables. On a publicly available clinical fMRI dataset, we
compare the novelty detection performance of multivariate normative models
estimated by the proposed NP approach to a baseline multi-task Gaussian process
regression approach and show substantial improvements for certain diagnostic
problems.

Extended Survey (VVVX) led to a clean sample of likely members. Based on this
integrated dataset, position, distance, reddening, size, metallicity, absolute
magnitude, and proper motion of this object are measured. We estimate the
following parameters: $\alpha=17:31:12$, $\delta=-39:48:30$ (J2000), $D=11.5
\pm 1.0$ kpc, $E(J-Ks)=0.20 \pm 0.03$ mag, $R_c=10$ pc, $R_t=150$ pc,
$[Fe/H]=-1.5 \pm 0.3$ dex, $M_i < -8.6 \pm 1.0$, $\mu_{\alpha} = -2.85$ mas
yr$^{-1}$, and $\mu_{\delta} = 2.55$ mas yr$^{-1}$. The nature of this object
is discussed. If FRS 1758 is a genuine globular cluster, it is one of the
largest in the Milky Way, with a size comparable or even larger than that of
$\omega$ Cen, being also an extreme outlier in the size vs. Galactocentric
distance diagram. The presence of a concentration of long-period RR Lyrae
variable stars and blue horizontal branch stars suggests that it is a typical
metal-poor globular cluster of Oosterhoff type II. Further exploration of a
larger surrounding field reveals common proper motion stars, suggesting either
tidal debris or that FRS\,1758 is actually the central part of a larger
extended structure such as a new dwarf galaxy, tentatively named as Scorpius.
In either case, this object is remarkable, and its discovery graphically
illustrates the possibility to find other large objects hidden in the Galactic
Bulge using future surveys.

the probability of existence of a fundamental acceleration scale is essentially
0. In this paper, we use the same method to revisit the same question: Is there
a fundamental acceleration scale in galaxies? We fit each galaxy rotation curve
of 175 SPARC galaxies with Gaussian priors on galaxy parameters and a variable
acceleration scale. After marginalizing over the nuisance parameters, we find
that the marginalized posterior distributions of the acceleration scale become
broad. The incompatibility between the global best fit and the marginalized
posterior distributions of the acceleration scale is greatly reduced. However,
there still exists evidence that rejects MOND as a fundamental theory. More
accurate observations are needed to exclude or confirm the existence of a
fundamental acceleration scale in galaxies.

regression with many appealing properties. In the big data era, the sheer
volume and spatial/temporal disparity of big data may prohibit centrally
processing and storing the data. This has imposed considerable hurdle for
nearest neighbor predictions since the entire training data must be memorized.
One effective way to overcome this issue is the distributed learning framework.
Through majority voting, the distributed nearest neighbor classifier achieves
the same rate of convergence as its oracle version in terms of both the regret
and instability, up to a multiplicative constant that depends solely on the
data dimension. The multiplicative difference can be eliminated by replacing
majority voting with the weighted voting scheme. In addition, we provide sharp
theoretical upper bounds of the number of subsamples in order for the
distributed nearest neighbor classifier to reach the optimal convergence rate.
It is interesting to note that the weighted voting scheme allows a larger
number of subsamples than the majority voting one. Our findings are supported
by numerical studies using both simulated and real data sets.

methods from Random Matrix Theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to
propose a coarse-grained bottom-up picture of the event horizon -- and the
associated Hawking evaporation phenomenon. The analysis is possible due to a
hierarchy between the various timescales at work. Event horizon physics is
found to be non-local at the Planck scale, and we demonstrate how non-unitary
physics and information loss arise from the process of averaging over the
chaotic unitary dynamics. Most interestingly, we correlate the onset of
non-unitarity with the emergence of spacetime geometry outside the horizon. We
also write a mean field action for the evolution of qubits -- represented by
polarization states of supergravity modes. This evolution is shown to have
similarities to a recent toy model of black hole evaporation proposed by Osuga

accelerated by the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, but the
specific kinetic mechanism resulting in the perpendicular ion heating required
by observations is not understood. A promising mechanism has been proposed by
Chandran et al. (2010), which in this paper we call ""magnetic moment breaking""
(MMB). As currently formulated, MMB dissipation operates only on the ion
perpendicular motion, and does not influence their parallel temperature. Thus,
the MMB mechanism acting by itself produces coronal hole proton distributions
that are unstable to the ion-cyclotron anisotropy instability. This quasilinear
instability is expected to operate faster than the nonlinear turbulent cascade,
scattering ions into the parallel direction and generating
quasi-parallel-propagating ion-cyclotron (IC) waves. To investigate the
consequences of this instability on the MMB-heated protons, we construct a
homogeneous model for protons with coronal hole properties. Using a simplified
version of the resonant cyclotron interaction, we heat the protons by the MMB
process and instantaneously scatter them to lower anisotropy while
self-consistently generating parallel-propagating IC waves. We present several
illustrative cases, finding that the extreme anisotropies implied by the MMB
mechanism are limited to reasonable values, but the distinctive shape of the
proton distribution derived by Klein & Chandran (2016) is not maintained. We
also find that these combined processes can result in somewhat higher particle
energization than the MMB heating alone. These quasilinear consequences should
follow from any kinetic mechanism that primarily increases the perpendicular
ion temperature in a collisionless plasma.

is a key issue. Most of existing techniques developed to improve training
efficiency (e.g. imitation) target on general tasks rather than being tailored

propose a novel framework, Assisted Reinforcement Learning, where a classical
controller (e.g. a PID controller) is used as an alternative, switchable policy
to speed up training of DRL for local planning and navigation problems. The
core idea is that the simple control law allows the robot to rapidly learn
sensible primitives, like driving in a straight line, instead of random
exploration. As the actor network becomes more advanced, it can then take over
to perform more complex actions, like obstacle avoidance. Eventually, the
simple controller can be discarded entirely. We show that not only does this
technique train faster, it also is less sensitive to the structure of the DRL
network and consistently outperforms a standard Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient network. We demonstrate the results in both simulation and real-world

level, we build a task network which simultaneously performs depth estimation
and semantic segmentation on the synthetic data. Meanwhile, we encourage the
network to preserve correlation between depth and semantics by adversarial
training on the output space. We then validate our method on two pairs of
synthetic to real dataset: Virtual KITTI to KITTI, and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes,
where we achieve a significant performance gain compared to the non-adapt

usefulness of geometric information from synthetic data for cross-domain

addressed when building such models is to design handcrafted features that are
effective for the prediction task at hand. In this paper, we make the first
attempt to solve the feature learning problem by taking the unsupervised
learning approach to learn a compact representation of the raw features with a
large degree of redundancy. Specifically, in order to capture the underlying

short-term memory (LSTM) network to obtain a fixed-length embedding for each
input sequence. When compared with the original features, the new features that
correspond to the embedding obtained by the modified LSTM-AE are not only more
parsimonious but also more discriminative for our prediction task. Using simple
supervised learning models, the learned features can improve the prediction
accuracy by up to 17% compared with the supervised neural networks and reduce
overfitting to the dominant low-performing group of students, specifically in

simplifies both the Higgs and gauge-sector extensions, which can be helpful in
radiative corrections. At one loop, these sectors contribute to the $CPT$-even
part of the photon propagator, characterized by the Riemann-type tensor
$(k_F)_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$. We give exact results for the contributions to the

Weyl-type tensor $(\hat{k}_F)_{\alpha \beta \mu \nu}$, the Ricci-type tensor
$(k_F)_{\alpha \beta}$, and the curvature-type scalar $k_F$. In the Yukawa
sector, one-loop contributions are ultraviolet finite, but most of them are
unobservable due to finite renormalization. The only observable effect is a
contribution proportional to $(k_F)_{\alpha \beta}$ that emerges via a
dimension-6 term that is observer and gauge invariant. In the Higgs and gauge
sectors, all the irreducible parts of the corresponding Riemann-type tensors
receive divergent contributions, so they are observable. The only finite

contributions as radiative corrections to the renormalized tensors and assume
that both effects are of the same order of magnitude to find bounds from vacuum
birefringence and compare with the literature. Bounds on $(k_F)_{\alpha \beta}$
contributions, innocuous to birefringence, are also derived using limits on the

enough that it can be used in modular fashion for parameter optimization
searches of exoplanet atmosphere spectra. The transport equations are
formulated in 1D, accounting for sedimentation and diffusion. The grain size is

profiles we simulate transmission spectra covering the visual to mid-IR

larger cloud diffusivity $K_{zz}$ increases the thickness of the cloud, pushing
the $\tau=1$ surface to a lower pressure layer higher in the atmosphere. A
larger nucleation rate also increases the cloud thickness while it suppresses
the grain size. Coagulation is most important at high nuclei injection rates

predicts too steep a rise. In addition, the ejecta-DOM interaction does not

does not suffer from this major drawback of the ejecta-companion model. We

applications. A combination of interfacial viscosity and Marangoni stress
acting over a surfactant-coated droplet in pressure driven flow offers greater
flexibility to modulate the cross-stream motion of it. Despite the intense
theoretical and numerical research towards manipulating the surfactant-laden
Newtonian droplets in Poiseuille flow, the experimental investigations are
seldom explored. Herein, we report our study on understanding the influence of
interfacial viscosity on the cross-stream motion of a surfactant-coated
Newtonian droplet in both isothermal and non-isothermal Poiseuille flow from a
theoretical as well as an experimental perspective. A theoretical model has
been developed to understand the effect of interfacial viscosity on the lateral
migration of a droplet under the assumptions of no shape deformation and
negligible fluid inertia or thermal convection. Theoretical analysis is
performed under two limiting conditions: (i) when the transport of surfactants
is dominated by surface-diffusion and (ii) when the transportation of
surfactants is dominated by surface-convection. Our theoretical analysis shows
that both the dilatational as well as the shear surface viscosities suppress
the lateral migration velocity of the droplet. Experiments have been performed
to validate the theoretically predicted droplet trajectories and to understand
the influence of channel confinement on the lateral migration of the droplet.
It has been observed from the experiments that the droplet travels faster
towards the centerline of the flow in a highly confined domain. The results
presented in this study could provide new vistas in designing and analyzing
various droplet-based microfluidic, biomedical and bio-microfluidic devices.

information flow, differential privacy, and cost analysis. In order to achieve
the best results, these systems often use relational refinements and relational
effects to maximally exploit the similarity in the structure of the two
programs being compared. Relational type systems are appealing for relational
properties because they deliver simpler and more precise verification than what
could be derived from typing the two programs separately. However, relational
type systems do not yet achieve the practical appeal of their non-relational
counterpart, in part because of the lack of a general foundations for
implementing them.
  In this paper, we take a step in this direction by developing bidirectional
relational type checking for systems with relational refinements and effects.
Our approach achieves the benefits of bidirectional type checking, in a
relational setting. In particular, it significantly reduces the need for typing
annotations through the combination of type checking and type inference. In
order to highlight the foundational nature of our approach, we develop
bidirectional versions of several relational type systems which incrementally
combine many different components needed for expressive relational analysis.

problems where standalone solvers exhibit varied performance. Among such a tool
reside selection hyper-heuristics. By combining the strengths of each solver,
this kind of hyper-heuristic offers a more robust tool. However, their
effectiveness is highly dependent on the 'features' used to link them with the
problem that is being solved. Aiming at enhancing selection hyper-heuristics,
in this paper we propose two types of transformation: explicit and implicit.
The first one directly changes the distribution of critical points within the
feature domain while using a Euclidean distance to measure proximity. The
second one operates indirectly by preserving the distribution of critical
points but changing the distance metric through a kernel function. We focus on
analyzing the effect of each kind of transformation, and of their combinations.
We test our ideas in the domain of constraint satisfaction problems because of
their popularity and many practical applications. In this work, we compare the
performance of our proposals against those of previously published data.
Furthermore, we expand on previous research by increasing the number of
analyzed features. We found that, by incorporating transformations into the
model of selection hyper-heuristics, overall performance can be improved,
yielding more stable results. However, combining implicit and explicit
transformations was not as fruitful. Additionally, we ran some confirmatory
tests on the domain of knapsack problems. Again, we observed improved
stability, leading to the generation of hyper-heuristics whose profit had a
standard deviation between 20% and 30% smaller.

the end we obtain a solution with six free parameters. Our solution contains as
particular cases well-known models in the literature. As an application, we
report a model that evades LHC constraints, flavor changing neutral currents
and low energy constraints. Simultaneously, the model is able to explain the
flavor anomalies in the Wilson coefficients $C_9(\mu)$ and $C_{10}(\mu)$
without modifying the corresponding Wilson coefficients for the first family.
In our approach, this procedure is always possible for $Z'$ masses smaller than
$\sim 2.5$~TeV.

ground-state atoms or molecules, or polarizable bodies in general, due to their
common interaction with the quantum electromagnetic field. They arise from the
exchange of virtual photons between the atoms, and, in the case of three or
more atoms, are not additive. In this review, after having introduced the
relevant coupling schemes and effective Hamiltonians, as well as properties of
the vacuum fluctuations, we~outline the main properties of dispersion
interactions, both in the nonretarded (van der Waals) and retarded
(Casimir--Polder) regime. We then discuss their deep relation with the
existence of the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and vacuum
energy. We describe some transparent physical models of two- and three-body
dispersion interactions, based on dressed vacuum field energy densities and
spatial field correlations, which stress their deep connection with vacuum
fluctuations and vacuum energy. These models give a clear insight of the
physical origin of dispersion interactions, and also provide useful
computational tools for their evaluation. We show that this aspect is
particularly relevant in more complicated situations, for example when
macroscopic boundaries are present. We also review recent results on dispersion
interactions for atoms moving with noninertial motions and the strict relation
with the Unruh effect, and on resonance interactions between entangled
identical atoms in uniformly accelerated motion.

control over only the electric impedance and magnetic admittance of the
Huygens' metasurface proved insufficient to produce the desired reflectionless
field transformation. To maintain zero reflections for wide refraction angles,
magnetoelectric coupling between the electric and magnetic response of the

assess the specular reflections of the metasurface, while a far-field antenna
measurement characterized its refraction nature. The measurements verify that
the fabricated metasurface has negligible reflections and the majority of the
scattered power is refracted to the desired Floquet mode. This provides an

here. An ALE theory is developed by endowing the surface with a mesh whose
in-plane velocity need not depend on the in-plane material velocity, and can be
specified arbitrarily. A finite element implementation of the theory is
formulated and applied to curved and deforming surfaces with in-plane
incompressible flows. Numerical inf--sup instabilities associated with in-plane
incompressibility are removed by locally projecting the surface tension onto a
discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The general isoparametric
finite element method, based on an arbitrary surface parametrization with
curvilinear coordinates, is tested and validated against several numerical
benchmarks. A new physical insight is obtained by applying the ALE developments
to cylindrical fluid films, which are computationally and analytically found to
be stable to non-axisymmetric perturbations, and unstable with respect to
long-wavelength axisymmetric perturbations when their length exceeds their
circumference. A Lagrangian scheme is attained as a special case of the ALE
formulation. Though unable to model fluid films with sustained shear flows, the
Lagrangian scheme is validated by reproducing the cylindrical instability.
However, relative to the ALE results, the Lagrangian simulations are found to
have spatially unresolved regions with few nodes, and thus larger errors.

computational time of a fully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model with
a controllable effect on its accuracy. The hydraulic fracture model is based on
the poroelastic formulation of the displacement discontinuity method (DDM)
which is a special formulation of the boundary element method (BEM). DDM is a
powerful and efficient method for problems involving fractures. However, this
method becomes slow as the number of temporal, or spatial elements increases,
or necessary details such as poroelasticity, that makes the solution
history-dependent, are added to the model. FMM is a technique to expedite
matrix-vector multiplications within a controllable error without forming the
matrix explicitly. Fully-coupled poroelastic formulation of DDM involves the
multiplication of a dense matrix with a vector in several places. A crucial
modification to DDM is suggested in two places in the algorithm to leverage the
speed efficiency of FMM for carrying out these multiplications. The first
modification is in the time-marching scheme, which accounts for the solution of
previous time steps to compute the current time step. The second modification
is in the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) to iteratively solve for
the problem unknowns. Several examples are provided to show the efficiency of
the proposed approach in problems with large degrees of freedom (in time and
space). Examples include hydraulic fracturing of a horizontal well and randomly
distributed pressurized fractures at different orientations with respect to
horizontal stresses. The results are compared to the conventional DDM in terms
of computational processing time and accuracy. Accordingly, the proposed
algorithm may be used for fracture propagation studies while substantially
reducing the processing time with a controllable error.

transferred by prime movers (e.g. workers, engines). We derive the implications

The solution to these problems shows that growth is driven by positive marginal
energy surplus of energy goods (e.g. rice, oil), yet materializes through prime

monotonically increasing function of $M_\star$ with no sign of a decline at
high masses, and 2) the most massive spirals ($M_\star\simeq 1-3 \times 10^{11}

baryons associated to their haloes into stars. These results imply that the
most efficient galaxies at forming stars are massive spirals (not $L^\ast$
galaxies), they reach nearly 100% efficiency and thus, once both their cold and

symmetries responsible for the conservation of various components of the
multipole moments of the charge density. We explain how to construct field
theories invariant under the action of the algebra. These field theories
generally break rotational invariance and exhibit anisotropic scaling. We
further explain how to partially gauge the multipole algebra. Such gauging
makes the symmetries responsible for the conservation of multipole moments
local, while keeping rotation and translations symmetries global. It is shown
that upon such gauging one finds the symmetric tensor gauge theories, as well
as the generalized gauge theories discussed recently in the literature. The
outcome of the gauging procedure depends on the choice of the multipole
algebra. In particular, we show how to construct an effective theory for the

a two dimensional example with operators supported on a Sierpinski triangle. We

the quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a
migration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly
infer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile
matching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate
monotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in
heavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the
same number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the
fractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable
($Q_{\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy
loss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the
$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum

proposed likelihood, we infer the underlying dark-matter density field and

large-scale modes and introduces an overall bias in the power spectrum, our
likelihood provides unbiased estimates of the matter power spectrum over the

liquid model which utilizes the emergent conformal symmetry of the low energy
sector of the Lieb-Liniger model. The first system we consider is a variable
length interferometer with two Y-junctions connected back to back. We
demonstrate that dynamics of the relative phase between the two arms of the
interferometer can be analyzed using the formalism developed by Moore in the
problem of electromagnetic vacuum squeezing in a cavity with moving mirrors.
The second system we discuss is a single condensate in a box potential with
periodically moving walls. This system exhibits classical excitation of the
mode resonant with the drive as well as nonlinear generation of off-resonant
modes. In addition we find strong parametric multimode squeezing between modes
whose energy difference matches integer multiples of the drive frequency.

approximately mirroring the observational properties of the Dark Energy Survey

the estimated one. We further apply the method to estimate the cluster member
contamination for the DES Y1 redMaPPer cluster mass calibration analysis, and
compare the results to an alternative approach based on the angular correlation
of weak lensing source galaxies. We find indications that the correlation based
estimates are biased by the selection of the weak lensing sources in the
cluster vicinity, which does not strongly impact the $P(z)$ decomposition
method. Collectively, these benchmarks demonstrate the strength of the $P(z)$
decomposition method in alleviating membership contamination and enabling
highly accurate cluster weak lensing studies without broad exclusion of source

lead to the corruption of encoded logical information. In this work we compare
two different variants of the surface code with a comparable number of qubits:
the surface code defined on a square lattice and the same model on a lattice
that is rotated by $\pi / 4$. This seemingly innocuous change increases the
distance of the code by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.However, as we show, this gain
can come at the expense of significantly increasing the number of different
failure mechanisms that are likely to occur. We use a number of different
methods to explore this tradeoff over a large range of parameter space under an
independent and identically distributed noise model. We rigorously analyze the
leading order performance for low error rates, where the larger distance code
performs best for all system sizes. Using an analytical model and Monte Carlo
sampling, we find that this improvement persists for fixed sub-threshold error
rates for large system size, but that the improvement vanishes close to

sub-threshold error rates where the square lattice surface code marginally
outperforms the rotated model.

observed three transits of GJ 3470b in the Lyman-alpha line with the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) as part of the Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet
Treasury (PanCET) program. Absorption signatures are detected with similar
properties in all three independent epochs, with absorption depths of 35+-7% in
the blue wing of the line, and 23+-5% in the red wing. The repeatability of
these signatures, their phasing with the planet transit, and the radial
velocity of the absorbing gas allow us to conclude that there is an extended
upper atmosphere of neutral hydrogen around GJ 3470 b. We determine from our
observations the stellar radiation pressure and XUV irradiation from GJ 3470

3470b with the EVaporating Exoplanets (EVE) code. The unusual redshifted
signature can be explained by the damping wings of dense layers of neutral
hydrogen that extend beyond the Roche lobe and are elongated in the direction
of the planet motion. This structure could correspond to a shocked layer of
planetary material formed by the collision of the expanding thermosphere with
the wind of the star. The blueshifted signature is well explained by neutral
hydrogen atoms escaping at rates of about 1e10 g s-1 that are blown away from
the star by its strong radiation pressure and are quickly photoionized,
resulting in a smaller exosphere than that of the warm Neptune GJ 436b. The
stronger escape from GJ 3470b, however, may have led to the loss of about 4-35%
of its current mass over its 2 Gyr lifetime.

admit two different AdS vacua. One is conformal, and the holographic two-point
functions of the boundary energy-momentum tensor are the same as the ones
obtained in Einstein gravity. The other AdS vacuum, which arises at some
critical point of the coupling constants, preserves the scale invariance but
not the special conformal invariance due to the logarithmic radial dependence
of the Horndeski scalar. In addition to the transverse and traceless graviton

operators. We find that the trace/scalar mode gives rise to an non-vanishing
two-point function, which distinguishes the scale invariant theory from the
conformal theory. The two-point function vanishes in $d=2$, where the full

graph $G$ from an infinite sequence of attacks is the eternal vertex cover
number of $G$, denoted by $evc(G)$. It is known that, given a graph $G$ and an

whether this problem is in NP or not. Precise value of eternal vertex cover
number is known only for certain very basic graph classes like trees, cycles

  For any graph $G$, it is known that $mvc(G) \le evc(G) \le 2 mvc(G)$, where
$mvc(G)$ is the minimum vertex cover number of $G$. Though a characterization
is known for graphs for which $evc(G) = 2 mvc(G)$, a characterization of graphs
for which $evc(G) = mvc(G)$ remained open. Here, we achieve such a
characterization for a class of graphs that includes chordal graphs and
internally triangulated planar graphs. For some graph classes including
biconnected chordal graphs, our characterization leads to a polynomial time
algorithm to precisely determine $evc(G)$ and to determine a safe strategy of
guard movement in each round of the game with $evc(G)$ guards.
  The characterization also leads to NP-completeness results for the eternal

share hypothesis structure with the PMBM filter. By showing that the prediction

chiral active particles under confinement by employing an extension of the
active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. The chirality modeled by means of an effective
torque term leads to a drastic reduction of the accumulation near the walls
with respect to the case without handedness and to the appearance of currents
parallel to the container walls accompanied by a large accumulation of
particles in the inner region. In the case of two-dimensional chiral particles
confined by harmonic walls, we determine the analytic form of the distribution
of positions and velocities in two different situations: a rotationally
invariant confining potential and an infinite channel with parabolic walls.
Both these models display currents and chirality induced inner accumulation.
These phenomena are further investigated by means of a more realistic
description of a channel, where the wall and bulk regions are clearly
separated. The corresponding current and density profiles are obtained by
numerical simulations. At variance with the harmonic models, the third model
shows a progressive emptying of the wall regions and the simultaneous
enhancement of the bulk population. We explain such a phenomenology in terms of
the combined effect of wall repulsive forces and chiral motion and provide a
semiquantitative description of the current profile in terms of an effective
viscosity of the chiral gas.

Nevertheless, it is a fairly common misconception that Delta-z c represents a

evaluating large changes in a quantity, it is often more useful to consider
logarithmic differences. Defining zeta = ln lambda_obs - ln lambda_em results
in a more accurate approximation for line-of-sight velocity and, more
importantly, this means that the cosmological and peculiar velocity terms
become additive: Delta-zeta c can represent a velocity at any cosmological
distance. Logarithmic shift zeta, or equivalently ln(1+z), should arguably be
used for photometric redshift evaluation. For a comparative non-accelerating
universe, used in cosmology, comoving distance is proportional to zeta. This
means that galaxy population distributions in zeta, rather than z, are close to
being evenly distributed in comoving distance, and they have a more aesthetic
spacing when considering galaxy evolution. Some pedagogic notes on these

cuprate superconductors is investigated using linear response theory. The Hall
conductivity is of paramount importance in that its sign and magnitude directly
reflect the sign of the charge carriers and the size of particle-hole asymmetry
effects. Here we apply a strong-pairing fluctuation theory that incorporates
pseudogap effects known to be important in cuprate transport. As a result, in
the vicinity of the transition temperature our theoretical approach goes beyond
the conventional superconducting fluctuation formalism. In this regime,
pseudogap effects are evident in both the transverse and longitudinal
conductivities and the bosonic response is explicitly gauge invariant. The
presence of a gap in the excitation spectrum is also apparent at higher
temperatures, where the gapped fermionic quasiparticles are the dominant
contribution to the Hall coefficient. The observed non-monotonic temperature
dependence of the Hall coefficient therefore results from a delicate interplay
between the fermionic quasiparticles and the bosonic fluctuations. An important
feature of our work is that the sign of the Hall conductivity from the Cooper
pair fluctuations is the same as that of their fermionic constituents. Thus, we
find no sign change in the Hall coefficient above the transition temperature.
This prediction is corroborated by experiments, away from special charge
ordering stoichiometries. The theoretical results presented in this paper
provide crucial signatures that can be experimentally verified, enabling
validation of the present theory.

  abstract. This version includes minor corrections and additions",,,,"quant-ph cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis addresses the interplay between asymptotic hypothesis testing and
entropy inequalities in quantum information theory. In the first part of the
thesis we focus on hypothesis testing. We consider two main settings; one can
either fix quantum states while optimizing over measurements or fix a
measurement and evaluate its capability to discriminate by optimizing over
states. In the former setting, we prove a composite quantum Stein's Lemma. We
also discuss how this gives an operational interpretation to several quantities
of interest. For the latter, we give the optimal asymptotic error rates in
several symmetric and asymmetric settings, and discuss properties and examples
of these rates.
  In the second part, the focus is shifted to entropy inequalities. We start
with recoverability inequalities. Using tools developed to prove the composite
Stein's Lemma, we give a strengthened lower bound on the conditional quantum
mutual information (CQMI). Next, we give an operational interpretation to the
relative entropy of recovery via hypothesis testing. Then, we discuss some
recent counterexamples, which show that the relative entropy of recovery is not
a lower bound on the CQMI; we provide more counterexamples where some systems
are classical.
  We then turn to a seemingly different type of entropy inequalities called
bounds on information combining. Using a particular recoverability inequality,
we give a lower bound and additionally conjecture optimal lower and upper
bounds. Furthermore, we discuss implications of our bounds to the finite
blocklength behavior of Polar codes.
  Finally, we discuss Renyi-$2$ entropy inequalities for Gaussian states, by
exploiting their formulation as log-det inequalities to find recoverability
related bounds on several quantities. We apply this to Gaussian steerability
and entanglement measures, proving their monogamy and several other features.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) describes the distribution of absorbing column
density as a function of ionization parameter. Up to now, AMD has been measured
only for seven objects with high-resolution X-ray data that contain absorption
lines from ionized heavy elements. Even though the number of measured AMDs is
not large, they display a universal broad shape containing a prominent dip, for
which the absorbing column drops by around two orders of magnitude. In this
paper, we tested a range of photoionization models against the overall shape of
the AMD as observed in Seyferts. In particular, we demonstrate that the shape
of the AMD depends both on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of radiation
which enters the outflow, and the density of the warm absorber (WA). The model
that best reproduces the observed shape of the AMD is one wherein the gas
density of the WA is of the order of $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, irradiated by an SED
whose optical/UV luminosity is 100 times higher than the X-ray luminosity. When
the cloud density is higher than $\sim 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, free-free heating
dominates the entire absorber, and only one instability zone occurs, which is
in agreement with observations.

cyclic graph, there is additional ""collision""- like interference in the quantum
random walk along with the usual interference in any such walk on any graph,
closed or otherwise. We find that the quantum walker remains localized in
comparison to the classical one, even in the absence of disorder, a phenomenon
that is potentially attributable to the additional interference in the quantum
case. This is to be contrasted with the situation on open graphs, where the
quantum walker, being effectively denied the collision-like interference,
garners a much higher spread than its classical counterpart. We use Shannon
entropy of the position probability distribution to quantify spread of the
walker in both quantum and classical cases. We find that for a given number of
vertices on a cyclic graph, the entropy with respect to number of steps for the
quantum walker saturates, on average, to a value lower than that for the
corresponding classical one. We also analyze variations of the entropies with
respect to system size, and look at the corresponding asymptotic growth rates.

Specifically, multiple planes are acquired by near-instantaneous axial scanning

existing particularities observed in software testing considering the
development of a computer game. Method. A mixed-method approach based on a case
study and an opinion survey was applied to collect quantitative and qualitative

testing in game development. Results. We analyzed over 70 messages posted on
three well-established network of question-and-answer communities related to

population, often sell their harvest at low, unfavorable prices before
spoilage. These farmers often lack access to either cold storage or market
forecasts. In particular, by having access to cold storage, farmers can store
their produce for longer and thus have more flexibility as to when they should
sell their harvest by. Meanwhile, by having access to market forecasts, farmers
can more easily identify which markets to sell at and when. While affordable
cold storage solutions have become more widely available, there has been less
work on produce price forecasting. A key challenge is that in many regions of
India, predominantly in rural and remote areas, we have either very limited or
no produce pricing data available from public online sources.
  In this paper, we present a produce price forecasting system that pulls data
from the Indian Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare's website
Agmarknet, trains a model of prices using over a thousand markets, and displays
interpretable price forecasts in a web application viewable from a mobile
phone. Due to the pricing data being extremely sparse, our method first imputes
missing entries using collaborative filtering to obtain a dense dataset. Using
this imputed dense dataset, we then train a decision-tree-based classifier to
predict produce prices at different markets. In terms of interpretability, we
display the most relevant historical pricing data that drive each forecasted
price, where we take advantage of the fact that a wide family of
decision-tree-based ensemble learning methods are adaptive nearest neighbor
methods. We show how to construct heuristic price uncertainty intervals based
on nearest neighbors. We validate forecast accuracy on data from Agmarknet and
a small field survey of a few markets in Odisha.

reduces the overlap of their internal wave functions with those of nucleons.
The same model is also used to study the production of triton and hypertriton

high-temperature conditions. The calculations were based on ab initio random
structure searching and the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Here, we point
out that, despite the of inestimable value of such calculations at
high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, the high-$P$ high-$T$ phase
diagram proposed by Nelson et al. for CaF$_{2}$ neither is in qualitative
agreement with the results of previous ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
nor with the existing corps of experimental data. Therefore, we conclude that
the QHA-based approach employed by Nelson et al. cannot be applied reliably to
the study of phase boundaries involving superionic phases. This conclusion is
further corroborated by additional ab initio calculations performed in the
superionic compounds SrF$_{2}$, BaF$_{2}$, Li$_{3}$OCl, and AgI.

This is an estimation approach that relies on the changes in video dynamic

obtain a feature map by processing a 3D PSD tensor obtained from a set of
distorted frames. This is a full-reference tempospatial approach that considers
both temporal and spatial PSD characteristics. This makes it ubiquitously
suitable for videos with varying motion patterns and spatial contents. Our
technique does not make any assumptions on the coding conditions, streaming

which makes it feasible for real-time and practical implementations. We
validate our proposed metric by testing it on a variety of distorted sequences
from PVQA databases. The results show that our metric estimates the perceptual
quality at the sequence level accurately. We report the correlation
coefficients with the differential mean opinion scores (DMOS) reported in the

effective signal features for analysis are difficult to be extracted. Toward a

We present a semi-automated approach to facilitate precision studies of clone

classification with manual validation of clone pairs. We demonstrate that the
proposed automatic approach has a very high precision and it significantly
reduces the number of clone pairs that need human validation during precision

  Effects on estimates of UV continua and Solar Spectral Irradiance variability","Accepted in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aaf6b7",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Synthesis performed under non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE)
conditions usually overestimate stellar spectra. An approach widely adopted in
the literature to reduce the excess of UV radiation consists of artificially
increasing the continuum opacity by using multiplicative fudge factors, which
are empirically derived to impose the synthetized spectrum to match the
observed one. Although the method was initially developed to improve non-LTE
synthesis of spectral lines, it has been recently employed to model solar
spectral irradiance variability. Such irradiance reconstruction techniques
combine spectral synthesis of different types of structures, which are
performed making use of factors derived from a reference, quiet Sun model.
Because the opacity scales in a complex way with plasma physical properties,
the question arises whether, and to what extent, fudge factors derived using a
reference model can be used to adjust the opacity of models representing
different types of quiet and magnetic features. Here we investigate the effects
of opacity fudging on estimates of solar and stellar irradiance variability in
UV bands. We find that the use of fudge factors might underestimate the
variability by 19% and up to 20% in the ranges 230-300 nm and 300-400 nm,
respectively. These estimates are model dependent and should be considered as
upper limits. Finally, our analysis suggests the uncertainties generated by the
use of fudge factors to increase with the decrease of stellar metallicity and
to be significant for stars whose variability is facula-dominated and whose
effective temperature is larger than approximately 4000 K.

$H$ is the Hubble expansion rate, and $p$ is a constant. While the tracker is
present up to the cubic-order Horndeski Lagrangian $L=c_2X-c_3X^{(p-1)/(2p)}

latter case, however, there exists an approximate tracker solution in the early
cosmological epoch with the nearly constant field equation of state
$w_{\phi}=-1-2p\dot{H}/(3H^2)$. The scaling solution, which corresponds to
$p=1$, is the unique case in which all the terms in the field density
$\rho_{\phi}$ and the pressure $P_{\phi}$ obey the scaling relation
$\rho_{\phi} \propto P_{\phi} \propto H^2$. Extending the analysis to the
coupled DHOST theories with the field-dependent coupling $Q(\phi)$ between the

$Q(\phi)=1/(\mu_1 \phi+\mu_2)$, where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are constants. For
the constant $Q$, i.e., $\mu_1=0$, we derive fixed points of the dynamical

the pressure is computed in a second step. The AMP interface conditions for the
fluid arise from the outgoing characteristic variables in the solid and are

physical properties of their evolved and massive host galaxies, focussing on
the mass-related quenching channel followed by $\mathcal{M}^\star (\simeq
10^{10.6} M_\odot)$ galaxies in the rest-frame NUVrK colour diagram at $0.2 < z
< 0.5$. While our results confirm that (1) radio-loud AGNs are predominantly
hosted by already-quenched and very massive ($M_*>10^{11}M_\odot$) galaxies,
ruling out their feedback as a primary driver of $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxy
quenching, we found that (2) X-ray AGNs affected by heavy obscuration of their
soft X-ray emission are mostly hosted by $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxies that are
in the process of quenching. This is consistent with a quenching scenario that
involves mergers of (gas-poor) $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxies $after$ the onset
of the quenching process, i.e., a scenario where $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxy
mergers are not the cause but rather an aftermath of the quenching
mechanism(s). In that respect, we discuss how our results may support a picture
where the slow quenching of $\mathcal{M}^\star$ galaxies happens due to
halo-halo mergers along cosmic filaments.

  Local Classification Model",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Bayesian classification, it is important to establish a probabilistic
model for each class for likelihood estimation. Most of the previous methods
modeled the probability distribution in the whole sample space. However,
real-world problems are usually too complex to model in the whole sample space;
some fundamental assumptions are required to simplify the global model, for
example, the class conditional independence assumption for naive Bayesian
classification. In this paper, with the insight that the distribution in a
local sample space should be simpler than that in the whole sample space, a
local probabilistic model established for a local region is expected much
simpler and can relax the fundamental assumptions that may not be true in the
whole sample space. Based on these advantages we propose establishing local
probabilistic models for Bayesian classification. In addition, a Bayesian
classifier adopting a local probabilistic model can even be viewed as a
generalized local classification model; by tuning the size of the local region
and the corresponding local model assumption, a fitting model can be
established for a particular classification problem. The experimental results
on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of local
probabilistic models for Bayesian classification.

of an M-objective optimization problem often forms an (M-1)-dimensional
topological simplex (a curved line for M=2, a curved triangle for M=3, a curved
tetrahedron for M=4, etc.). Since the dimensionality of the solution set
increases as the number of objectives grows, an exponentially large sample size
is needed to cover the solution set. To reduce the required sample size, this
paper proposes a Bezier simplex model and its fitting algorithm. These
techniques can exploit the simplex structure of the solution set and decompose
a high-dimensional surface fitting task into a sequence of low-dimensional
ones. An approximation theorem of Bezier simplices is proven. Numerical

that the proposed method achieves an accurate approximation of high-dimensional

conducted in the post-optimization process and enable a better trade-off

style transfer ever since Gatys et al. introduced the neural method. One of the
remaining challenges is to balance a trade-off among three critical
aspects---speed, flexibility, and quality: (i) the vanilla optimization-based
algorithm produces impressive results for arbitrary styles, but is
unsatisfyingly slow due to its iterative nature, (ii) the fast approximation
methods based on feed-forward neural networks generate satisfactory artistic
effects but bound to only a limited number of styles, and (iii)
feature-matching methods like AdaIN achieve arbitrary style transfer in a
real-time manner but at a cost of the compromised quality. We find it
considerably difficult to balance the trade-off well merely using a single
feed-forward step and ask, instead, whether there exists an algorithm that
could adapt quickly to any style, while the adapted model maintains high
efficiency and good image quality. Motivated by this idea, we propose a novel
method, coined MetaStyle, which formulates the neural style transfer as a
bilevel optimization problem and combines learning with only a few
post-processing update steps to adapt to a fast approximation model with
satisfying artistic effects, comparable to the optimization-based methods for
an arbitrary style. The qualitative and quantitative analysis in the
experiments demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves high-quality
arbitrary artistic style transfer effectively, with a good trade-off among
speed, flexibility, and quality.

Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to find sessions that are prone to
code failure in applications that rely on telemetry data for system health
monitoring. We also use LSTM networks to extract telemetry patterns that lead
to a specific code failure. For code failure prediction, we treat the telemetry
events, sequence of telemetry events and the outcome of each sequence as words,
sentence and sentiment in the context of sentiment analysis, respectively. Our
proposed method is able to process a large set of data and can automatically
handle edge cases in code failure prediction. We take advantage of Bayesian
optimization technique to find the optimal hyper parameters as well as the type
of LSTM cells that leads to the best prediction performance. We then introduce
the Contributors and Blockers concepts. In this paper, contributors are the set
of events that cause a code failure, while blockers are the set of events that
each of them individually prevents a code failure from happening, even in
presence of one or multiple contributor(s). Once the proposed LSTM model is
trained, we use a greedy approach to find the contributors and blockers. To
develop and test our proposed method, we use synthetic (simulated) data in the
first step. The synthetic data is generated using a number of rules for code
failures, as well as a number of rules for preventing a code failure from
happening. The trained LSTM model shows over 99% accuracy for detecting code
failures in the synthetic data. The results from the proposed method outperform
the classical learning models such as Decision Tree and Random Forest. Using
the proposed greedy method, we are able to find the contributors and blockers
in the synthetic data in more than 90% of the cases, with a performance better
than sequential rule and pattern mining algorithms.

uses the idea of the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to estimate the slowly
decaying modes from source iteration and remove them from the solution. The
memory cost of our acceleration technique is that the scalar flux for a number
of iterations must be stored; the computational cost is a singular value
decomposition of a matrix comprised of those stored scalar fluxes.On 1-D slab
geometry problems we observe an order of magnitude reduction in the number of
transport sweeps required compared to source iteration and that the number of
sweeps required is independent of the scattering ratio in the problem. These
observations hold for an extremely heterogeneous problem and a 2-D problem. In
2-D we do observe that the effectiveness of the approach slowly degrades as the
mesh is refined, but is still about one order of magnitude faster than source
iteration.

first idea is a new parameterization of the optimality condition which allows
us to develop a class of homotopy proximal variable-metric methods. We show
that under appropriate assumptions such as strong convexity-type and
smoothness, or self-concordance, our new schemes can achieve finite global
iteration-complexity bounds. Our second idea is a primal-dual-primal framework
for proximal-Newton methods which can lead to some useful computational
features for a subclass of nonsmooth composite convex optimization problems.
Starting from the primal problem, we formulate its dual problem, and use our
homotopy proximal Newton method to solve this dual problem. Instead of solving
the subproblem directly in the dual space, we suggest to dualize this
subproblem to go back to the primal space. The resulting subproblem shares some
similarity promoted by the regularizer of the original problem and leads to
some computational advantages. As a byproduct, we specialize the proposed
algorithm to solve covariance estimation problems. Surprisingly, our new
algorithm does not require any matrix inversion or Cholesky factorization, and
function evaluation, while it works in the primal space with sparsity
structures that are promoted by the regularizer. Numerical examples on several
applications are given to illustrate our theoretical development and to compare
with state-of-the-arts.

applications such as compressing high-dimensional data, supervised kernel
linear classifier, and unsupervised generative modeling. However, when applied
to systems which are not defined on one-dimensional lattices, a serious
drawback of the MPS is the exponential decay of the correlations, which limits
its power in capturing long-range dependences among variables in the system. To
alleviate this problem, we propose to introduce long-range interactions, which
act as shortcuts, to MPS, resulting in a new model \textit{ Shortcut Matrix

significantly the correlation length of the MPS, while preserving the
computational efficiency. We develop efficient training methods of SMPS for

giant planet in a protoplanetary gas disk. The highly excited planetesimals
generate bow shocks, the mechanism of which results in chondrule formation,
crystallization of silicate dust, and evaporation of icy planetesimals. The
planetesimals beyond 2:1 resonance migrate owing to the gas drag and obtain the
maximum eccentricity around 3:1 resonance, which is located at approximately
half the planetary distance. The eccentricity depends on the parameters of the
planetesimals and the Jovian planet, such as size and location, and gas density
of the disk. The maximum relative velocity of a 100-km-sized planetesimal with
respect to the gas disk reaches up to ~12 km/s in the case of Jupiter owing to
secular resonance, which occurs because of the disk's gravity. We find that if
a Jovian mass planet is located within 10 au, the planetesimals larger than 100
km gain sufficient velocity to cause the melting of chondrule precursors and
crystallization of the silicate. The maximum velocity is higher for large
planetesimals and eccentric planets. Planetesimals are trapped temporarily in
the resonances and continue to have high speed over >1 Myr after the formation
of a Jovian planet. This duration fits into the timescale of chondrule
formation suggested by the isotopic data. The evaporation of icy planetesimals
occurs when a Jovian planet is located within 15 au. This mechanism can be a
new indicator of planet formation in exosystems if some molecules ejected from

The infants were divided in two groups, the ZIKV-exposed (n=13) and controls
(n=8). Single channel ECG was recorded in each child at ~15 months of age and
HRV was analyzed in 5 min segments to provide a comprehensive characterization
of the degree of variability and complexity of the heart rate. Using a cubic
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier we identified babies as Zika cases or

86%. Our results show that HRV metrics can help differentiate between
ZIKV-affected, yet asymptomatic, and non-ZIKV exposed babies. We identified the
Grid Count as the best HRV measure in this study allowing such differentiation,

noise and user labeling mistakes. Our choice of leveraging both positive and
negative examples and the nested containment structure of selected code is
effective in refining search queries. Compared with an existing technique,

(HF) solutions of fullerenes C$_{60}$, C$_{36}$, and C$_{20}$ in order to
characterize the nature of electron correlation in them. Our analysis is based
on (1) the critical regularization strength to restore symmetry breaking in the
recently developed regularized orbital optimized second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset
perturbation theory ($\kappa$-OOMP2), (2) singlet-triplet gaps from various MP2
methods, and (3) natural orbital occupation numbers from restricted
coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (RCCSD) and coupled-cluster valence
bond with singles and doubles (CCVB-SD). Based on these three independent
probes, we conclude that C$_{36}$ (D$_\text{6h}$) exhibits genuine strong
correlation and symmetry breaking whereas C$_{60}$ exhibits {\it artificial} HF
symmetry breaking and is not strongly correlated. Investigating the critical
regularization strength, we discuss strong correlation in C$_{20}$ at the
Jahn-Teller distorted geometries (C$_\text{2h}$, D$_\text{2h}$, C$_\text{i}$,
and D$_\text{3h}$) and the I$_\text{h}$ geometry. Only C$_{20}$ (I$_\text{h}$)
was found to be strongly correlated while others exhibit {\it artificial} HF
symmetry breaking. This analysis highlights a useful feature of the recommended
$\kappa$-OOMP2 method. It is an electronic structure method that describes
dynamic correlation, and attenuates strong correlation in MP2 towards zero by
regularization. Therefore, $\kappa$-OOMP2 will exhibit symmetry breaking in its
reference determinant only when correlation is strong (i.e., essential symmetry
breaking). Artificial symmetry breaking (arising in HF due to neglect of
dynamic correlation) is thus removed in $\kappa$-OOMP2.

these multiple topological features in the compensated half-metal Cr$_2$CoAl

(minor) spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there are (1) a total of twelve pairs of
magnetic Weyl points, (2) three distinct sets of triple nodal points near the

This combination gives rise to fully spin polarized nexus fermions, in a system

The observed high Curie temperature of 750 K and calculated SOC hybridization
mixing of several meV should make these nexus fermions readily measurable.
Unlike topological features discussed for other Heuslers which emphasize their
strong ferromagnetism, this compensated half-metal is impervious to typical

the calculations of model reproduce the key features of the results of TDSE. It

  Optimal Control Meets Multi-Armed Bandit Learning","30 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.SY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) rely on intra-vehicle sensors such as
camera and radar as well as inter-vehicle communication to operate effectively.
This reliance on cyber components exposes ACVs to cyber and physical attacks in
which an adversary can manipulate sensor readings and physically take control
of an ACV. In this paper, a comprehensive framework is proposed to thwart cyber
and physical attacks on ACV networks. First, an optimal safe controller for
ACVs is derived to maximize the street traffic flow while minimizing the risk
of accidents by optimizing ACV speed and inter-ACV spacing. It is proven that
the proposed controller is robust to physical attacks which aim at making ACV
systems instable. To improve the cyber-physical security of ACV systems, next,
data injection attack (DIA) detection approaches are proposed to address cyber
attacks on sensors and their physical impact on the ACV system. To
comprehensively design the DIA detection approaches, ACV sensors are
characterized in two subsets based on the availability of a-priori information
about their data. For sensors having a prior information, a DIA detection
approach is proposed and an optimal threshold level is derived for the
difference between the actual and estimated values of sensors data which
enables ACV to stay robust against cyber attacks. For sensors having no prior
information, a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm is proposed to enable
ACV to securely control its motion. Simulation results show that the proposed
optimal safe controller outperforms current state of the art controllers by
maximizing the robustness of ACVs to physical attacks. The results also show
that the proposed DIA detection approaches, compared to Kalman filtering, can
improve the security of ACV sensors against cyber attacks and ultimately
improve the physical robustness of an ACV system.

such as Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) and
Virgo is coalescences of neutron star (NS) binaries. Even though a NS's
macroscopic properties such as mass and radius have been obtained from
electro-magnetic wave observations, its internal structure has been studied
mainly by using theoretical approaches. However, with the advent of Advanced
LIGO and Virgo, the tidal deformability of a NS, which depends on the internal
structure of the NS, has been recently obtained from GW observations.
Therefore, reducing the measurement error of tidal deformability as small as
possible in the GW parameter estimation is important. In this study, we
introduce a post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational waveform model in which the tidal
deformability contribution appears from 5 PN order, and we use the Fisher
matrix (FM) method to calculate parameter measurement errors. Because the FM is
computed semi-analytically using the wave function, the measurement errors can
be obtained much faster than those of practical parameter estimations based on
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We investigate the measurement errors for mass
and tidal deformability by applying the FM to the nonspinning TaylorF2 waveform
model. We show that if the tidal deformability corrections are considered up to
the 6 PN order, the measurement error for the dimensionless tidal deformability
can be reduced to about $75 \%$ compared to that obtained by considering only
the 5 PN order correction.

k-fold Zappa-Szep product of cyclic groups, which we call OGS decomposition. It
is easy to see that existence of an OGS decomposition for all the composition
factors of a non-abelian group G implies the existence of an OGS for G itself.
Since the composition factors of a soluble group are cyclic groups, it
obviously has an OGS decomposition. Therefore, the question of the existence of
an OGS decomposition is interesting for non-soluble groups. The Jordan-Holder
Theorem motivates us to consider an existence of an OGS decomposition for the
finite simple groups. In 1993, Holt and Rowley showed that PSL_{2}(q) and
PSL_{3}(q) can be expressed as a product of cyclic groups. In this paper, we
consider an OGS decomposition of PSL_{2}(q) from a point of view different than
that of Holt and Rowley. We look at its connection to the BN-pair decomposition
of the group. This connection leads to sequences over F_{q}, which can be
defined recursively, with very interesting properties, and which are closely
connected to the Dickson and to the Chebyshev polynomials. Since every finite
simple group of Lie-type has $BN-pair$ decomposition, the ideas of the paper
might be generalized to further simple groups of Lie-type.

leverage both labeled and unlabeled data at the same time. Recent
semi-supervised approaches focus on deep neural networks and have achieved
promising results on several benchmarks: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN. However,
most of their experiments are based on models trained from scratch instead of
pre-trained models. On the other hand, transfer learning has demonstrated its
value when the target domain has limited labeled data. Here comes the intuitive
question: is it possible to incorporate SSL when fine-tuning a pre-trained
model? We comprehensively study how SSL methods starting from pretrained models
perform under varying conditions, including training strategies, architecture
choice and datasets. From this study, we obtain several interesting and useful
observations.
  While practitioners have had an intuitive understanding of these
observations, we do a comprehensive emperical analysis and demonstrate that:
(1) the gains from SSL techniques over a fully-supervised baseline are smaller
when trained from a pre-trained model than when trained from random
initialization, (2) when the domain of the source data used to train the
pre-trained model differs significantly from the domain of the target task, the
gains from SSL are significantly higher and (3) some SSL methods are able to
advance fully-supervised baselines (like Pseudo-Label).
  We hope our studies can deepen the understanding of SSL research and
facilitate the process of developing more effective SSL methods to utilize
pre-trained models. Code is now available at github.

measure of how far a graph is from being well-covered. It is defined as the
difference between the maximum and minimum size of a maximal independent set.
  We investigate the independence gap of a graph from structural and
algorithmic points of view, with a focus on classes of perfect graphs.
Generalizing results on well-covered graphs due to Dean and Zito (1994) and
Hujdurovi\'c et al. (2018), we express the independence gap of a perfect graph
in terms of clique partitions and use this characterization to develop a
polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs of constant independence gap
in any class of perfect graphs of bounded clique number. Next, we introduce a
hereditary variant of the parameter, which we call hereditary independence gap
and which measures the maximum independence gap over all induced subgraphs of
the graph. We show that determining whether a given graph has hereditary
independence gap at most $k$ is polynomial-time solvable if $k$ is fixed and
co-NP-complete if $k$ is part of input. We also investigate the complexity of
the independent set problem in graph classes related to independence gap,
showing that the problem is NP-complete in the class of graphs of independence
gap at most one and polynomial-time solvable in any class of graphs with
bounded hereditary independence gap. Combined with some known results on
claw-free graphs, our results imply that the independent domination problem is
solvable in polynomial time in the class of $\{$claw, 2$P_3\}$-free graphs.

are frequently observed in the solar wind, yet their generation mechanism is
still an open question. Based on the Wind data during the years 2005$-$2015,
this paper carries out a statistical study on plasma characteristics associated
with the occurrence of ECWs. The probability density distributions (PDDs) of
proton temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$) and proton parallel beta
($\beta_\parallel$) are investigated, where $\perp$ and $\parallel$ refer to
perpendicular and parallel to the background magnetic field, respectively. The
PDDs depend on solar wind types as well as wave polarizations, and those for
ECWs with left-handed (LH) polarization exhibit considerable differences from
the PDDs for ambient solar winds. The distributions of occurrence rates of LH
ECWs in ($\beta_\parallel$, $T_\perp/T_\parallel$) space show a tendency that
the occurrence rates increase with proton temperature anisotropies. The
$\beta_\parallel$ with maximum of occurrence rates is near 0.1 when
$T_\perp/T_\parallel > 1$ while it is around 1 when $T_\perp/T_\parallel < 1$.
The presence of alpha$-$proton differential flow with large kinetic energy
corresponds to a much high occurrence rate as well as the domination of LH
polarization of ECWs. Based on these observations and existing theories, we
propose that the proton cyclotron and parallel firehose instabilities with
effects of alpha$-$proton differential flow are likely responsible for the
local generation of LH ECWs in the solar wind. The generation mechanism of
right-handed ECWs seems to be complicated and more discussions are needed in
future researches.

for the fully frustrated square lattice Ising model in a transverse field (dual
to the 2+1 dimensional odd Ising gauge theory), and for a transverse field
Ising model with multi-spin interactions on the square lattice, which is dual
to a 2+1 dimensional even Ising gauge theory (and reduces to the two
dimensional quantum loop model in a certain limit). Our cluster algorithms use
a microcanonical update procedure that generalizes and exploits the notion of
""pre-marked motifs"" introduced earlier in the context of a quantum cluster
algorithm for triangular lattice transverse field Ising antiferromagnets. We
demonstrate that the resulting algorithms are significantly more efficient than
the standard link percolation based quantum cluster approach. We also introduce
a new canonical update scheme that leads to a further improvement in
measurement of some observables arising from its ability to make
one-dimensional clusters in the ""imaginary time"" direction. Finally, we
demonstrate that refinements in the choice of premarking strategies can lead to
additional improvements in the efficiency of the microcanonical updates. As a

bound weakly enough to be insensitive to the details of the interaction, but
dense enough to be insensitive to the exact values of the large two-body

observables around the unitarity limit converges. In particular, in this scheme
the nuclear force is constructed such that the gross features of states in the
nuclear chart are determined by a very simple leading-order interaction,

moved to their physical values by small perturbative corrections. Explicit
evidence in favor of this conjecture is shown for the binding energies of three

variable selection for parametric cure regression models in time-to-event
analysis under random right-censoring. In this context, it often happens that
some subjects are ""cured"", i.e., they will never experience the event of
interest. Then, the sample of censored observations is an unlabeled mixture of
cured and ""susceptible"" subjects. Using inverse probability censoring weighting
(IPCW), we propose a likelihood-based estimation procedure for the cure
regression model without making assumptions about the distribution of survival
times for the susceptible subjects. The IPCW approach does require a
preliminary estimate of the censoring distribution, for which general
parametric, semi- or non-parametric approaches can be used. The incorporation
of a penalty term in our estimation procedure is straightforward; in
particular, we propose L1-type penalties for variable selection. Our
theoretical results are derived under mild assumptions. Simulation experiments
and real data analysis illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach.

iron and quartz in different ratios. Without magnetic fields, particles in all
samples grow into a bouncing barrier. These aggregates reversibly form larger
clusters in the presence of magnetic fields. The size of these clusters depends
on the strength of the magnetic field and the ratio between iron and quartz.
The clustering increases the size of the largest entities by a factor of a few.
If planetesimal formation is sensitive to the size of the largest aggregates,
e.g., relying on streaming instabilities, then planetesimals will
preferentially grow iron-rich in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. This

probe of a set of cosmological parameters. Given the cosmological observable
and the cosmological parameter, there is an optimum range of redshifts where
the observable can constrain the parameter in the most effective manner. For
other redshift ranges the observable values may be degenerate with respect to
the cosmological parameter values and thus inefficient in constraining the
given parameter. These are blind redshift ranges. We determine the optimum and
the blind redshift ranges of cosmological observables with respect to the
cosmological parameters: matter density parameter $\Omega_m$, equation of state
parameter $w$ and a modified gravity parameter $g_a$ which parametrizes the
evolution of an effective Newton's constant. We consider the observables:
growth rate of matter density perturbations expressed through $f(z)$ and
$f\sigma_8$, the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
observables $D_V(z) \times \frac{r_s^{fid}}{r_s}$, $H \times
\frac{r_s}{r_s^{fid}}$ and $D_A \times \frac{r_s^{fid}}{r_s}$, $H(z)$
measurements and the gravitational wave luminosity distance. We introduce a new
statistic $S_P^O(z)\equiv \frac{\Delta O}{\Delta P}(z) \cdot V_{eff}^{1/2}$,
including the effective survey volume $V_{eff}$, as a measure of the
constraining power of a given observable $O$ with respect to a cosmological
parameter $P$ as a function of redshift $z$. We find blind redshift spots $z_b$
($S_P^O(z_b)\simeq 0$) and optimal redshift spots $z_s$ ($S_P^O(z_s)\simeq
max$) for these observables with respect to the parameters $\Omega_m$, $w$ and
$g_a$. For $O=f\sigma_8$ and $P=(\Omega_{m},w,g_a)$ we find blind spots at
$z_b\simeq(1,2,2.7)$ respectively and optimal (sweet) spots at
$z_s=(0.5,0.8,1.2)$. Thus probing higher redshifts may be less effective than
probing lower redshifts with higher accuracy.

research area involving computer science, philosophy, logic, the social
sciences, etc. For an ethical autonomous system, the ability to justify and
explain its decision making is a crucial aspect of transparency and
trustworthiness. This paper takes a Value Driven Agent (VDA) as an example,
explicitly representing implicit knowledge of a machine learning-based
autonomous agent and using this formalism to justify and explain the decisions
of the agent. For this purpose, we introduce a novel formalism to describe the
intrinsic knowledge and solutions of a VDA in each situation. Based on this
formalism, we formulate an approach to justify and explain the decision-making
process of a VDA, in terms of a typical argumentation formalism,
Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA). As a result, a VDA in a given situation
is mapped onto an argumentation framework in which arguments are defined by the
notion of deduction. Justified actions with respect to semantics from
argumentation correspond to solutions of the VDA. The acceptance (rejection) of
arguments and their premises in the framework provides an explanation for why
an action was selected (or not). Furthermore, we go beyond the existing version
of VDA, considering not only practical reasoning, but also epistemic reasoning,
such that the inconsistency of knowledge of the VDA can be identified, handled
and explained.

assumption that individuals in uncertain situations tend to conform to the
local majority in their network. Among initial defectors, noise such as rumors
or opponents' provocations causes some of them to cooperate accidentally. At a
critical level of noise, these cooperators trigger a cascade of cooperation. We
find an analytic relationship between the phase transition and the asymmetry of
the Ising model, which in turn reflects the asymmetry of cooperation and

However, bugs in Mockito, a project augmented in a later-version of Defects4J,
do not receive much attention by recent researches. In this paper, we aim at
investigating the necessity of considering Mockito bugs when evaluating APR
techniques. Our findings show that: 1) Mockito bugs are not more complex for
repairing compared with bugs from other projects; 2) the bugs repaired by the
state-of-the-art tools share the same repair patterns compared with those
patterns required to repair Mockito bugs; however, 3) the state-of-the-art
tools perform poorly on Mockito bugs (Nopol can only correctly fix one bug
while SimFix and CapGen cannot fix any bug in Mockito even if all the buggy
locations have been exposed). We conclude from these results that existing APR
techniques may be overfitting to their evaluated subjects and we should
consider Mockito, or even more bugs from other projects, when evaluating newly
proposed APR techniques. We further find out a unique repair action required to
repair Mockito bugs named external package addition. Importing the external
packages from the test code associated with the source code is feasible for
enlarging the search space and this action can be augmented with existing
repair actions to advance existing techniques.

network. In the first approach, a (central) content server takes
responsibilities to collect information from all mobile edge nodes (MENs) in
the network and then performs our proposed deep learning (DL) algorithm to
predict the content demand for the whole network. However, such a centralized
approach may disclose the private information because MENs have to share their
local users' data with the content server. Thus, in the second approach, we
propose a novel distributed deep learning (DDL) based framework. The DDL allows
MENs in the network to collaborate and exchange information to reduce the error
of content demand prediction without revealing the private information of
mobile users. Through simulation results, we show that our proposed approaches
can enhance the accuracy by reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) up to
33.7% and reduce the service delay by 36.1% compared with other machine
learning algorithms.

random numbers. However, the security certification of the random numbers in
form of a stochastic model often introduces assumptions that are either hardly
justified or indeed unnecessary. Two important examples are the restriction of
an adversary to the classical regime as well as negligible correlations between
consecutive measurement outcomes. Additionally, non-rigorous system
characterization opens a security loophole. In this work we experimentally
realize a QRNG that does not rely on the aforementioned assumptions and whose
stochastic model is established by a rigorous -- metrological -- approach.
Based on quadrature measurements of vacuum fluctuations, we demonstrate a
real-time random number generation rate of 8 \,GBit/s. Our security
certification approach offers a number of practical benefits and will therefore
find widespread applications in quantum random number generators. In
particular, our generated random numbers are well suited for today's
conventional and quantum cryptographic solutions.

  Applications",,,,,"cs.SE cs.CR cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Android apps cooperate through message passing via intents. However, when
apps do not have identical sets of privileges inter-app communication (IAC) can
accidentally or maliciously be misused, e.g., to leak sensitive information
contrary to users expectations. Recent research considered static program
analysis to detect dangerous data leaks due to inter-component communication
(ICC) or IAC, but suffers from shortcomings with respect to precision,
soundness, and scalability. To solve these issues we propose a novel approach
for static ICC/IAC analysis. We perform a fixed-point iteration of ICC/IAC
summary information to precisely resolve intent communication with more than
two apps involved. We integrate these results with information flows generated
by a baseline (i.e. not considering intents) information flow analysis, and
resolve if sensitive data is flowing (transitively) through components/apps in
order to be ultimately leaked. Our main contribution is the first fully
automatic sound and precise ICC/IAC information flow analysis that is scalable
for realistic apps due to modularity, avoiding combinatorial explosion: Our
approach determines communicating apps using short summaries rather than
inlining intent calls, which often requires simultaneously analyzing all tuples
of apps. We evaluated our tool IIFA in terms of scalability, precision, and
recall. Using benchmarks we establish that precision and recall of our
algorithm are considerably better than prominent state-of-the-art analyses for
IAC. But foremost, applied to the 90 most popular applications from the Google
Playstore, IIFA demonstrated its scalability to a large corpus of real-world
apps. IIFA reports 62 problematic ICC-/IAC-related information flows via two or

spectral signature of hydrogen sulphide (H$_2$S) in Uranus's atmosphere (Irwin
et al., 2018). Here, we extend this analysis to Gemini-North/NIFS observations
of Neptune recorded in 2009 and find a similar detection of H$_2$S spectral
absorption features in the 1.57 - 1.58 $\mu$m range, albeit slightly less
evident, and retrieve a mole fraction of $\sim1-3$ ppm at the cloud tops. We
find a much clearer detection (and much higher retrieved column abundance above
the clouds) at southern polar latitudes compared with equatorial latitudes,
which suggests a higher relative humidity of H$_2$S here. We find our retrieved
H$_2$S abundances are most consistent with atmospheric models that have reduced
methane abundance near Neptune's south pole, consistent with HST/STIS
determinations (Karkoschka and Tomasko, 2011). We also conducted a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) of the Neptune and Uranus data and found that in the
1.57 - 1.60 $\mu$m range, some of the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs)
mapped closely to physically significant quantities, with one being strongly
correlated with the modelled H$_2$S signal and clearly mapping the spatial
dependence of its spectral detectability. Just as for Uranus, the detection of
H$_2$S at the cloud tops constrains the deep bulk sulphur/nitrogen abundance to
exceed unity (i.e. $ > 4.4 - 5.0$ times the solar value) in Neptune's bulk
atmosphere, provided that ammonia is not sequestered at great depths, and
places a lower limit on its mole fraction below the observed cloud of (0.4 -
1.3) $\times 10^{-5}$. The detection of gaseous H$_2$S at these pressure levels
adds to the weight of evidence that the principal constituent of the 2.5 -
3.5-bar cloud is likely to be H$_2$S ice.

proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at
$\sqrt{s}=13~\mathrm{TeV}$ in 2016. The measurement uses the
$\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$ all-jets final state, which comprises a total
of six jets. A kinematic fit is performed to reconstruct the decay of the
$\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$ system and suppress QCD multijet background.
By means of the ideogram method, the top quark mass is determined,
simultaneously constraining an additional jet energy scale factor
($\text{JSF}$). The result of
$172.34\pm0.20\,\text{(stat+JSF)}\pm0.76\,\text{(syst)}~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the
top quark mass is in good agreement with previous measurements in the same and
different final states.

processes. While used for many years in different shapes and forms, there is
little shared understanding of the concept and its relationship to enterprise
architecture. In this report we position the concept of business process map
within the domain of enterprise architecture. Based on literature, we provide a
conceptualisation of the process map as a business process architecture model
that can be integrated with the broader enterprise architecture model. From our
conceptualisation we derive requirements for designing a meta-model of a
modelling language for process maps. The design of this meta-model is the
subject of a research paper, entitled Architecting Business Process Maps, for
which this report acts as a complement that details the underlying process map
conceptualisation.

samples to larger distances than the Parkes data. Emission regions in the DRAO

traditional abstractive summarization task, reader-aware summarization
confronts two main challenges: (1) Comments are informal and noisy; (2) jointly
modeling the news document and the reader comments is challenging. To tackle
the above challenges, we design an adversarial learning model named
reader-aware summary generator (RASG), which consists of four components: (1) a
sequence-to-sequence based summary generator; (2) a reader attention module
capturing the reader focused aspects; (3) a supervisor modeling the semantic
gap between the generated summary and reader focused aspects; (4) a goal
tracker producing the goal for each generation step. The supervisor and the
goal tacker are used to guide the training of our framework in an adversarial
manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on our large-scale real-world text

pulsation amplitude and/or phase - in the Galactic bulge first overtone RR
Lyrae stars (RRc). We used the data gathered during the fourth phase of the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). Out of 10 826 analyzed RRc
stars, Blazhko effect was detected in 607 stars which constitute 5.6 percent of
the sample. It is the largest and most homogeneous sample of modulated RRc
stars analyzed so far. Modulation periods cover a wide range, from slightly
above 2 d to nearly 3000 d. Multiperiodic modulation was detected in 47 stars.
The appearance of modulation in the frequency domain was studied in detail.
Modulation manifests either as close doublets or as equidistant triplets and
multiplets centered on radial mode frequency and its harmonics. In a
significant fraction (29 percent) of stars, we have detected the modulation
frequency itself, which corresponds to the modulation of the mean stellar
brightness. Our search for period doubling effect, that was discovered recently
in modulated fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars, and triggered development of new
model behind the Blazhko modulation, yielded negative result. In 104 stars we
detected additional signals that could correspond to both radial and non-radial
modes. Statistical properties of modulated stars were analyzed in detail and
confronted with properties of non-modulated stars and of modulated fundamental
mode RR Lyrae stars. Our analysis provides constraints for the models to
explain the Blazhko phenomenon, which still remains a puzzle more than hundred
years after its discovery.

rely on other technologies such as free WiFi access points. Moreover, in
addition to its connectivity offer, the MVNO can also draw indirect revenues
from services due to its brand. In that framework including many access
technologies and several revenue sources, a possible partner MNO will then have
to decide which wholesale price to charge the MVNO for its resources. This
multi-actor context, added to the need to consider both wholesale and retail

In this paper, the optimal price setting is formulated as a multi-level
optimization problem which enables us to derive closed-form expressions for the
optimal MNOs wholesale prices and the optimal MVNO retail price. The price
attractivity of the MVNO is also evaluated in terms of its indirect revenues

can be used for weeding and for analyzing crop statistics. We implemented our

cause of intense geomagnetic storms. The majority of such events are caused by
the passage over Earth of a magnetic ejecta. Irrespective of the interplanetary
cause, fast-forward shocks often precede such strong southward B$_{z}$ periods.
Here, we first look at all long periods of strong southward magnetic fields as
well as fast-forward shocks measured by the \textit{Wind} spacecraft in a
22.4-year span. We find that 76{\%} of strong southward B$_{z}$ periods are
preceded within 48 hours by at least a fast-forward shock but only about 23{\%}
of all shocks are followed within 48 hours by strong southward B$_{z}$ periods.
Then, we devise a threshold-based probabilistic forecasting method based on the
shock properties and the pre-shock near-Earth solar wind plasma and
interplanetary magnetic field characteristics adopting a `superposed epoch
analysis'-like approach. Our analysis shows that the solar wind conditions in
the 30 minutes interval around the arrival of fast-forward shocks have a
significant contribution to the prediction of long-duration southward B$_{z}$
periods. This probabilistic model may provide on average a 14-hour warning time
for an intense and long-duration southward B$_{z}$ period. Evaluating the
forecast capability of the model through a statistical and skill score-based
approach reveals that it outperforms a coin-flipping forecast. By using the
information provided by the arrival of a fast-forward shock at L1, this model
represents a marked improvement over similar forecasting methods. We outline a
number of future potential improvements.

detection and identification of positrons and neutrons respectively. The active

two dimensional arrays of wavelength shifting fibres and silicon
photomultipliers, for a total of 3200 readout channels. Signals are recorded

rate of over 2 Tbit/s. In this paper, we describe a novel readout and trigger
system built for the experiment, that satisfies requirements on: compactness,
low power, high performance, and very low cost per channel. The system uses a
combination of high price-performance FPGAs with a gigabit Ethernet based
readout system, and its total power consumption is under 1 kW. The use of zero
suppression techniques, combined with pulse shape discrimination trigger
algorithms to detect neutrons, results in an online data reduction factor of

attention worldwide. With the use of low-cost LIS on building walls, signals
can be reflected by the LIS and sent out along desired directions by
controlling its phases, thereby providing supplementary links for wireless
communication systems. In this study, we evaluate the performance of an
LIS-assisted large-scale antenna system by formulating a tight approximation of
the ergodic capacity and investigate the effect of the phase shifts on the
ergodic capacity in different propagation scenarios. In particular, we propose
an optimal phase shift design based on the ergodic capacity approximation and
statistical channel state information. Furthermore, we derive the requirement
on the quantization bits of the LIS to promise an acceptable capacity
degradation. Numerical results show that using the proposed phase shift design
can achieve the maximum ergodic capacity, and a 2-bit quantizer is sufficient
to ensure capacity degradation of no more than 1 bit/s/Hz.

and molecular physics to planetary systems, are represented by quasi-integrable
Hamiltonian systems. Since Arnold's example, the long-term diffusion in
Hamiltonian systems with more than two degrees of freedom has been represented
as a slow diffusion within the `Arnold web', an intricate web formed by chaotic
trajectories. With modern computers it became possible to perform numerical
integrations which reveal this phenomenon for moderately small perturbations.
Here we provide a semi-analytic model which predicts the extremely slow-time
evolution of the action variables along the resonances of multiplicity one. We
base our model on two concepts: (i) By considering a (quasi-)stationary phase
approach to the analysis of the Nekhoroshev normal form, we demonstrate that
only a small fraction of the terms of the associated optimal remainder provide
meaningful contributions to the evolution of the action variables. (ii) We
provide rigorous analytical approximations to the Melnikov integrals of terms
with stationary or quasi-stationary phase. Applying our model to an example of
three degrees of freedom steep Hamiltonian provides the speed of Arnold
diffusion, as well as a precise representation of the evolution of the action
variables, in very good agreement (over several orders of magnitude) with the
numerically computed one.

leave relativistic remnants upon their demise. Moreover the well defined
observational properties of the main sequence cohort will be critical to the

convection-diffusion-reaction and pure transport problems discretized with

graph-theoretic artificial diffusion operator and a novel shock detector for
isogeometric analysis. Stabilization in time and space directions are performed
similarly, which allow us to use high-order discretizations in time without any
CFL-like condition. The method is proven to yield solutions that satisfy the
discrete maximum principle (DMP) unconditionally for arbitrary order. In
addition, the stabilization is linearity preserving in a space-time sense.
Moreover, the scheme is proven to be Lipschitz continuous ensuring that the
nonlinear problem is well-posed. Solving large problems using a space-time
discretization can become highly costly. Therefore, we also propose a
partitioned space-time scheme that allows us to select the length of every time
slab, and solve sequentially for every subdomain. As a result, the
computational cost is reduced while the stability and convergence properties of
the scheme remain unaltered. In addition, we propose a twice differentiable
version of the stabilization scheme, which enjoys the same stability properties
while the nonlinear convergence is significantly improved. Finally, the
proposed schemes are assessed with numerical experiments. In particular, we
considered steady and transient pure convection and convection-diffusion
problems in one and two dimensions.

the annotation challenge, leading to overfitting classifiers and degraded
classification performance. The lack of annotated pixels also necessarily
results in few hard examples of various entities critical for generating a
robust classification hyperplane. To overcome the problem of the data scarcity
and lack of hard examples in training, we introduce a two-step hard example
generation (HEG) approach that first generates hard example candidates and then
mines actual hard examples. In the first step, a generator that creates hard
example candidates is learned via the adversarial learning framework by fooling
a discriminator and a pixel-wise classification model at the same time. In the
second step, mining is performed to build a fixed number of hard examples from
a large pool of real and artificially generated examples. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed HEG approach, we design a 9-layer fully

that using generated hard examples from the proposed HEG approach improves the

of spatiotemporal events of active-motion and the use of tracking. Most current
work in object recognition deals with static images during both learning and
recognition. In contrast, we are interested in a dynamic scene where visual
processes, such as detecting motion events and tracking, contribute
spatiotemporal information, which is useful for object attention, motion
segmentation, 3-D understanding and object interactions. We explore the use of
these sources of information in both learning and recognition processes. In the
first part of the work, we demonstrate how motion can be used for adaptive
detection of object-parts in dynamic environments, while automatically learning
new object appearances and poses. In the second and main part of the study we
develop methods for using specific types of visual motion to solve two
difficult problems in unsupervised visual learning: learning to recognize hands
by their appearance and by context, and learning to extract direction of gaze.

perfect matchings of a graph is used in many combinatorial algorithms. Kotzig,
Lov\'asz and Plummer developed a decomposition theory for graphs with perfect
matchings and their corresponding polytopes known as the tight cut
decomposition which breaks down every graph into a number of indecomposable
graphs, so called bricks. For many properties that are of interest on graphs
with perfect matchings, including the description of the perfect matching
polytope, it suffices to consider these bricks. A key result by Lov\'asz on the
tight cut decomposition is that the list of bricks obtained is the same
independent of the choice of tight cuts made during the tight cut decomposition
procedure. This implies that finding a tight cut decomposition is polynomial
time equivalent to finding a single tight cut.
  We generalise the notions of a tight cut, a tight cut contraction and a tight
cut decomposition to hypergraphs. By providing an example, we show that the
outcome of the tight cut decomposition on general hypergraphs is no longer
unique. However, we are able to prove that the uniqueness of the tight cut
decomposition is preserved on a slight generalisation of uniform hypergraphs.
Moreover, we show how the tight cut decomposition leads to a decomposition of
the perfect matching polytope of uniformable hypergraphs and that the
recognition problem for tight cuts in uniformable hypergraphs is polynomial
time solvable.

emergence of mesoscopic structure from local networked processes driven by
conflict and homophily. AVMs display rich behavior, including a phase
transition from a fully-fragmented regime of ""echo-chambers"" to a regime of
persistent disagreement governed by low-dimensional quasistable manifolds. Many
extant methods for approximating the behavior of AVMs are either restricted in
scope, expensive in computation, or inaccurate in predicting important
statistics. In this work, we develop a novel, second-order moment closure
approximation method for binary-state rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same model
variants. We incorporate a small amount of noise via a random mutation term,
which renders the system ergodic. Using ergodicity, we then approximate the
voting process, which is non-Markovian in the second moments of the system,
with a Markovian term near the phase transition. This approximation exploits an
asymmetry between different classes of voting events. The resulting scheme
enables us to predict the location of the phase transition and the active edge
density in the regime of persistent disagreement, across the entire space of
parameters and opinion densities. Numerically, our results are nearly exact for
the rewire-to-random model, and competitive with other current approaches for
the rewire-to-same model. Moreover, our computations display constant scaling
in the mean degree, enabling approximations for denser systems than previously
possible. We conclude with suggestions for model refinements and extensions.

utilized. Small magnetic elements of size of 3-100 squared HMI pixels with the
field strength above the detection threshold of 30 Mx cm$^{-2}$ were detected
and tracked. The turbulent diffusion coefficient was retrieved using the
pair-separation technique. Comparison with the previously reported quiet-sun
(QS) diffusivity was performed. It was found that: i) dispersion of small-scale
magnetic elements inside the AR area occurs in the regime close to normal
diffusion, whereas well-pronounced super-diffusion is observed in QS; ii) the
diffusivity regime operating in an AR (the magnitude of the spectral index and
the range of the diffusion coefficient) does not seem to depend on the
individual properties of an AR, such as total unsigned magnetic flux, state of
evolution, and flaring activity. We conclude that small-scale magnetic elements
inside an AR do not represent an undisturbed photosphere, but they rather are
intrinsic part of the whole coherent magnetic structure forming an active

related to processes above the photosphere, but it rather carries the footprint
of the sub-photospheric dynamics.

Hamiltonian which operates within the local cluster. Local embedding, which
involves only the occupied sector, has previously been employed in the context
of Co/graphene. Here, the methodology is extended in order to allow for
effective downfolding of the virtual sector thus allowing for significant
reduction in the computational effort required for AFQMC calculations. The
system size which can be feasibly treated with AFQMC is therefore greatly
extended as only a single local cluster is explicitly correlated at the AFQMC
level of theory. The approximation is controlled by the separate choice of the
spatial size of the active occupied region, $R_o$, and of the active virtual
region, $R_v$. The systematic dependence of the AFQMC energy on $R_o$ and $R_v$
is investigated and it is found that relative AFQMC energies of physical and

represent the data using a spatio-temporal tensor of 3D skeleton coordinates

GANs work particularly well. Secondly, we design an architecture to learn the
joint distribution of body poses and global motion, capable to hypothesize

space. In this previous study, the topological invariant was a property of the

systems. The considered end-to-end MC channel models incorporate the effects of
the release mechanism, the MC environment, and the reception mechanism on the
observed information molecules. Thereby, the various existing models for the
different components of an MC system are presented under a common framework and
the underlying biological, chemical, and physical phenomena are discussed.
Deterministic models characterizing the expected number of molecules observed
at the receiver and statistical models characterizing the actual number of
observed molecules are developed. In addition, we provide channel models for
time-varying MC systems with moving transmitters and receivers, which are
relevant for advanced applications such as smart drug delivery with mobile
nanomachines. For complex scenarios, where simple MC channel models cannot be
obtained from first principles, we investigate simulation-driven and
experimentally-driven channel models. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion

social objectives of acceptance or approval and strategic objectives of
coordination. Since these two objectives may take place in dfferent
environments, a two-layer network is the simple and natural framework for the
study of such kind of dynamical situations. In this paper we present a model in
which the state of the agents corresponds to one of two possible strategies.
They change their states by interaction with their neighbors in the network.
Inside each layer the agents interact by a social pressure mechanism, while
between the layers the agents interact via a coordination game. From an
evolutionary approach, we focus on the asymptotic solutions for all-to-all
interactions across and inside the layers and for any initial distribution of
strategies. We find new asymptotic configurations which do not exist in a
single isolated social network analysis. We report the emergence and existence
of chimera states in which two different collective states coexist in the
network. Namely, one layer reaches a state of full coordination while the other
remains in a dynamical state of coexistence of strategies. In addition, the

global anticoordination states to the agents inertia against social pressure,

we disprove this notion in the context of extracting the proton charge radius
from charge form factor data. Using a Monte Carlo study, we show that a simpler
regression model can in certain cases be the better predictive model. This is
especially true with noisy data where the complex model will fit the noise
instead of the physical signal. Thus, in order to select the appropriate
regression model to employ, a clear technique should be used such as the Akaike
information criterion or Bayesian information criterion, and ideally selected
previous to seeing the results. Also, to ensure a reasonable fit, the scientist
should also make regression quality plots, such as residual plots, and not just
rely on a single criterion such as reduced chi2. When we apply these techniques
to low four-momentum transfer cross section data, we find a proton radius that
is consistent with the muonic Lamb shift results. While presented for the case
of proton radius extraction, these concepts are applicable in general and can
be used to illustrate the necessity of balancing bias and variance when
building a regression model and validating results, ideas that are at the heart
of modern machine learning algorithms.

applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks.
However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample
complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit
the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we
describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy
actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this
framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and
entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible.
We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training
and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a
constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature
hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks,
as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal
robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements,
SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and
off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms,
our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different
random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for
learning in real-world robotics tasks.

completely suppresses the K\'arm\'an vortex shedding. Such a wavy cylinder is
forced to oscillate with a sinusoidal motion in the crossflow direction.
Examination of the lift force spectrum reveals that a critical forcing
frequency exists, below which the flow control effectiveness of the wavy
cylinder is retained, and beyond which the inherent vortex shedding resurrects.
Moreover, the resurrected unsteady vortex shedding can persist even without
sustained forcing, leading to the loss of control efficacy. This suggests that
in addition to the steady state developed from uniform initial condition, an
oscillatory state exists in the wake of wavy cylinder if the initial state is
sufficiently perturbed. The discovery of the bistable states calls for

The cloaking concept is analytically investigated via geometrical optics and
numerically realized with the help of the finite-difference time-domain method.
In order to benefit from its unique focusing and/or collimating characteristics
of light, the Luneburg lens is used. We show that by the proper combination of
Luneburg lenses in an array form, incident light bypasses the region between
junctions of the lenses, i.e., the ""dark zone."" Hence, direct interaction of an
object with propagating light is prevented if one places the object to be
cloaked inside that dark zone. This effect is used for hiding an object which
is made of a perfectly electric conductor material. In order to design an
implementable cloaking device, the Luneburg lens is discretized into a photonic
crystal structure having gradually varying air cylindrical holes in a
dielectric material by using Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximations.
Experimental verifications of the designed cloaking structure are performed at
microwave frequencies of around 8 GHz. The proposed structure is fabricated by
three-dimensional printing of dielectric polylactide material and a brass
metallic alloy is utilized in place of the perfectly electric conductor
material in microwave experiments. Good agreement between numerical and
experimental results is found.

Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. It is a challenging task to have
real-time, efficient, and accurate hardware RNN implementations because of the
high sensitivity to imprecision accumulation and the requirement of special
activation function implementations.
  A key limitation of the prior works is the lack of a systematic design
optimization framework of RNN model and hardware implementations, especially
when the block size (or compression ratio) should be jointly optimized with RNN
type, layer size, etc. In this paper, we adopt the block-circulant matrix-based
framework, and present the Efficient RNN (E-RNN) framework for FPGA
implementations of the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) application. The
overall goal is to improve performance/energy efficiency under accuracy
requirement. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
technique for more accurate block-circulant training, and present two design
explorations providing guidance on block size and reducing RNN training trials.
Based on the two observations, we decompose E-RNN in two phases: Phase I on
determining RNN model to reduce computation and storage subject to accuracy
requirement, and Phase II on hardware implementations given RNN model,
including processing element design/optimization, quantization, activation
implementation, etc. Experimental results on actual FPGA deployments show that
E-RNN achieves a maximum energy efficiency improvement of 37.4$\times$ compared

estimates of a person inside the wireless network. Fundamental challenges for
RSS DFL methods include having a model of RSS measurements as a function of a
person's location, and maintaining an accurate model as the environment changes
over time. Current methods rely on either labeled empty-area calibration or
labeled fingerprints with a person at each location. Both need to be frequently
recalibrated or retrained to stay current with changing environments. Other DFL
methods only localize people in motion. In this paper, we address these
challenges by, first, introducing a new mixture model for link RSS as a
function of a person's location, and second, providing the framework to update
model parameters without ever being provided labeled data from either
empty-area or known-location classes. We develop two new Bayesian localization

for which no polynomial time algorithms exist,such as Job Shop Scheduling and
many other Combinatorial Optimization problems. We will discuss some of these
algorithms and heuristics and how they help us solve complex problems of
practical importance.

  design tools",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We present a method for improving the efficiency and user experience of
freeform illumination design with machine learning. By utilizing orthogonal
polynomials to interface with artificial neural networks, we are able to
generalize relationships between freeform surface shapes and design parameters.
Then, by training the network to generalize the relationship between high-level
design goals and final performance, we were able to transform what is
traditionally a difficult and computationally intensive problem into a compact,
user friendly form. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated
through the design of uniform square patterns from off-axis positions and
rectangular patterns of tuneable aspect ratios and distances from the target.
