complicated in contrast with the beautiful Bloch ball of the qubit. We examined
the mechanism behind this fact in the frame work of general probabilistic
theory (GPT), and found rather general quantitative relations between the
geometry of the state space and its information storing capability. The main
result is the information-asymmetry identity, which (up to the constant term)
equates the {\it Minkowski measure of asymmetry} with the {\it information
storability} which, in addition to its own operational meaning, serves as an
upper bound to common information measures such as semi-classical capacity. As
a consequence, the asymmetry measure is lower-bounded by information storing
capability of the state space, so the increase in the latter enhances the
former. Coming back to the quantum systems, the $d$-level state space cannot be
symmetric ""because"" it can store more than a single bit of information. Also,
the Holevo capacity of any quantum channel with point-symmetric image is at
most a single bit. In the course of the research, we applied Shannon theory to
GPT, producing a couple of new results. Also presented is a new geometrical
proof of known upper bounds to information measures.

characterized uniquely in terms of the topology of the resolutions of their

describe the associated tree in terms of the dual graphs of such resolutions.
Then we extend our setting by allowing $L$ to be an arbitrary semivaluation on
$X$ and by defining $u_L$ on a suitable space of semivaluations. We prove that
any such function is again an ultrametric if and only if $X$ is arborescent,
and without any restriction on $X$ we exhibit special subspaces of the space of
semivaluations in restriction to which $u_L$ is still an ultrametric.

the crucial enablers of the SG concept; they supply accurate high-frequency

which is essential for time of use pricing, rapid fault detection, energy theft
prevention, while also providing consumers with more flexibility and control
over their consumption. However, highly accurate and granular SM data also

such as rechargeable batteries, renewable energy sources or demand shaping. A

the spin current is blockaded in the large-gap regime, this nonequilibrium
strongly-correlated problem maps into an equilibrium model solvable by the

splitting due to the nonequilibrium spin accumulation are thus obtained at high
precision. It is shown that while the bias-induced decoherence of the spin
Kondo effect is partially compensated by the superconductivity, the charge
Kondo effect is enhanced out of equilibrium and undergoes an additional
splitting by the superconducting proximity effect, yielding four Kondo peaks in
the local spectral density. In the charge Kondo regime, we find a universal

  Learning","Corrected typos",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Perception and reasoning are basic human abilities that are seamlessly
connected as part of human intelligence. However, in current machine learning
systems, the perception and reasoning modules are incompatible. Tasks requiring
joint perception and reasoning ability are difficult to accomplish autonomously
and still demand human intervention. Inspired by the way language experts
decoded Mayan scripts by joining two abilities in an abductive manner, this
paper proposes the abductive learning framework. The framework learns
perception and reasoning simultaneously with the help of a trial-and-error
abductive process. We present the Neural-Logical Machine as an implementation
of this novel learning framework. We demonstrate that--using human-like
abductive learning--the machine learns from a small set of simple hand-written
equations and then generalizes well to complex equations, a feat that is beyond
the capability of state-of-the-art neural network models. The abductive
learning framework explores a new direction for approaching human-level
learning ability.

techniques, as well as Open Information Extraction (OpenIE), to
semi-automatically discover the most popular roles within a corpus of 2,000
contributions sections obtained from PubMed Central resources. The roles
discovered by our approach include: experimenting (1,743 instances, 17% of the
entire role set within the corpus), analysis (1,343, 16%), study design (1,132,

automatically build a training set for the supervised role extractor, based on
Naive Bayes algorithm. According to the evaluation we performed, the proposed
role extraction algorithm is able to extract the roles from the text with

Fermions in mono-layer graphene containing particle-particle and white-noise
(out-plane) disorder interactions on an equal footing in the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac

probability measure of the graphene sheet, we show that the density fluctuation
($\zeta^{-1}$) is related to the disorder strength ($n_i$), the interaction
parameter ($r_s$) and the average density ($\bar{n}$) via the relation
$\zeta^{-1}\propto r_sn_i^2\bar{n}^{-1}$ for which $\bar{n}\rightarrow 0$ leads
to strong density inhomogeneities, i.e. electron-hole puddles (EHPs), in
agreement with the previous works. The general equation governing the two-body
distribution probability is obtained and analyzed. We present the analytical
solution for some limits which is used for calculating density-density response
function. We show that the resulting function shows power-law behaviors in
terms of $\zeta$ with fractional exponents which are reported. The
disorder-averaged polarization operator is shown to be a decreasing function of
momentum like ordinary 2D parabolic band systems. It is seen that a
disorder-driven momentum $q_{\text{ch}}$ emerges in the system which controls
the behaviors of the screened potential. We show that in small densities an
instability occurs in which imaginary part of the dielectric function becomes
negative and the screened potential changes sign. Corresponding to this
instability, some oscillations in charge density along with a
screening-anti-screening transition are observed. These effects become dominant
in very low densities, strong disorders and strong interactions, the state in
which EHPs appear. The total charge probability measure is another quantity
which has been investigated in this paper.

two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), based on a quantum cellular automaton
model. This transition is shown to be accompanied with a metal-insulator
transition, as well as a singularity in the electronic compressibility. To this
end, the electronic system which is assumed to be in contact with an electronic
reservoir, is meshed by using of the phase coherence length $\zeta_{\phi}$ as
an extent which divides the spatial dynamics of the electrons into two separate
regimes and controls the localization of electrons. For the scales much smaller
than $\zeta_{\phi}$ the treatment is quantum mechanical, whereas for the scales
much larger than $\zeta_{\phi}$ the picture of semi-classical transport works
and the classical Mote Carlo method is used. Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD) theory is
employed to find the dependence of the free energy of each cell on the
temperature ($T$), the (charged) disorder strength ($\Delta$) and the charge
content of the cell, and a cellular automaton model for transporting the
electrons between the cells is developed. At the transition line (in the
$T-\Delta$ space) the geometrical (e.g. correlation length) quantities also
diverge and some power-law behaviors emerge with some critical exponents in
agreement with the Gaussian free field (GFF) and the percolation theory. In the
percolating side the spanning cluster probability (SCP) (as a realization of
the conductivity) has a decreasing behavior in terms of the temperature which
is the characteristics of the metallic phase. Our simple model yields the
important features of the experimental observations, e.g. the singularity in
the conductivity in some critical density and also the universality
(non-universality) of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) for the small

fully covering receiver is analyzed in two parts: angular and radial
dimensions. For the angular distribution analysis, the receiver is divided into
180 slices to analyze the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of
variation of these slices. For the axial distance distribution analysis,
Kolmogorov- Smirnov test is applied for different significance levels. Also,
two different implementations of the reflection from the vessel surface (i.e.,
rollback and elastic reflection) are compared and mathematical representation
of elastic reflection is given. The results show that MMs have tendency to
spread uniformly beyond a certain ratio of the distance to the vessel radius.
By utilizing the uniformity, we propose a channel model for the partially

  arXiv:1707.09496",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The idea of minimum curvilinearity (MC) is that the hidden geometry of
complex networks, in particular when they are sufficiently sparse, clustered,
small-world and heterogeneous, can be efficiently navigated using the minimum
spanning tree (MST), which is a greedy navigator. The local topological
information drives the global geometrical navigation and the MST can be
interpreted as a growing path that greedily maximizes local similarity between
the nodes attached at each step by globally minimizing their overall distances
in the network. This is also valid in absence of the network structure and in
presence of only the nodes geometrically located over the network generative
manifold in a high-dimensional space. We know that random geometric graphs in
the hyperbolic space are an adequate model for realistic complex networks: the
explanation of this connection is that complex networks exhibit hierarchical,
tree-like organization, and in turn the hyperbolic geometry is the geometry of
trees. Here we show that, according to a mechanism that we define similarity
attachment, the visited node sequence of a network automaton can efficiently
approximate the nodes' angular coordinates in the hyperbolic disk, that
actually represent an ordering of their similarities. This is a consequence of
the fact that the MST, during its greedy growing process, at each step
sequentially attaches the node most similar (less distant) to its own cohort.
Minimum curvilinear automata (MCA) displays embedding accuracy which seems
superior to HyperMap-CN and inferior to coalescent embedding, however its link
prediction performance on real networks is without precedent for methods based
on the hyperbolic space. Finally, depending on the data structure used to build
the MST, the MCA's time complexity can also approach a linear dependence from
the number of edges.

different models for BH spin magnitude and orientation (MS0 - random, MS1 -
spin as a function of mass and metalicity, MS2 - constant value of $0.5$). We
check how they depend on BH-BH merger time and properties of the cluster. We
analyze the implications of GW kick retention fractions on intermediate massive

simulations to get a realistic sample of BH-BH mergers, assigned each BH spin
value according to a studied model, and calculated recoil velocity and final
spin based on most recent theoretical formulas. We discovered that for
physically motivated models, GW kick retention fractions are about $30\%$ and
display small dependence on assumptions about spin, but are much more prone to
cluster properties. In particular, we discovered a strong dependence of GW kick
retention fractions on cluster density. We also show that GW kick retention
fractions are high in final life stages of the cluster, but low at the
beginning. Finally, we derive formulas connecting final spin with effective

groups (collective motion) provides key insights into their biology and
ecology, while also yielding algorithms for bio-inspired technologies and
autonomous systems. It is becoming increasingly clear that many mobile animal
groups are composed of heterogeneous individuals with differential levels and
types of influence over group behaviors. The ability to infer this differential
influence, or leadership, is critical to understanding group functioning in
these collective animal systems. Due to the broad interpretation of leadership,
many different measures and mathematical tools are used to describe and infer
""leadership"", e.g., position, causality, influence, information flow. But a key
question remains: which, if any, of these concepts actually describes
leadership? We argue that instead of asserting a single definition or notion of
leadership, the complex interaction rules and dynamics typical of a group
implies that leadership itself is not merely a binary classification (leader or
follower), but rather, a complex combination of many different components. In
this paper we develop an anatomy of leadership, identify several principle
components and provide a general mathematical framework for discussing
leadership. With the intricacies of this taxonomy in mind we present a set of
leadership-oriented toy models that should be used as a proving ground for
leadership inference methods going forward. We believe this multifaceted
approach to leadership will enable a broader understanding of leadership and
its inference from data in mobile animal groups and beyond.

7} habit planes in low-carbon steels. The novelty of this theory is that no
parameter fitting is necessary. Instead, the shearing systems are chosen in
analogy to the original (single shear) phenomenological theory of martensite
crystallography as those that are macroscopically equivalent to twinning. Out
of all the resulting double shear theories, the ones leading to certain {h h k}
habit planes naturally arise as those having small shape strain magnitude and
satisfying a condition of maximal compatibility, thus making any parameter
fitting unnecessary. An interesting finding is that the precise coordinates of
the predicted {h h k} habit planes depend sensitively on the lattice parameters
of the fcc (face-centered cubic) and bcc (body-centered cubic) phases.
Nonetheless, for various realistic lattice parameters in low carbon steels, the
predicted habit planes are near {5 5 7}. The examples of Fe-0.252C and Fe-0.6C

are consistently close to the Kurdjumov-Sachs model. Furthermore, a MATLAB app

identifying a given tweet as a spam, or to classify a Twitter user account as a
spammer or a bot. In most cases the tweet classification has taken place
offline, on a pre-collected dataset of tweets. In this paper we present an
\emph{on-the-fly} approach to classify each newly downloaded tweet as
\emph{autogenerated} or not. We define an autogenerated tweet (AGT) as a tweet
where all or parts of the natural language content is generated automatically
by a bot or other type of program.
  Our on-the-fly approach makes use of two classifiers. The first classifies a
tweet solely based on the twitter text and the tweet metadata that comes with
every tweet. It is used for tweets posted by unknown users with no available
tweet history. An unknown user also triggers a batch job to start downloading
the missing user timeline information. The second classifier is used for tweets
posted by a user where the user timeline is downloaded and available.
Initially, it will be the first classifier that handles most of the tweets.
This will gradually change and after an initialization phase where we download
historic data for the most active users, we reach a state where the second
classifier handles a vast majority of all the tweets.
  A simulation using our on-the-fly detection mechanism indicates that we can
handle Twitter streams with up to 68,000 unique users each day. The bottleneck
is the time required to download new user timelines. The AGT detection is very
accurate. In a set of 5,000 tweets we correctly classified about 98\% of all
AGTs using a subject-wise cross-validation.

a CME. The existence of these non-eruptive flares raises the question of
whether such flares suffer from a lack of access to nearby open fields in the

56 flares from Sunspot Cycles 23 and 24 to test whether active regions that
produce eruptive X-class flares are preferentially located near coronal
magnetic field domains that are open to the heliosphere, as inferred from a

having access to open fields are eruptive at a higher rate than those for which
access is lacking. The significance of this result should be moderated due to
the small number of non-eruptive X-class flares in the sample, based on the

walker on ordered discrete substrates and complex networks with the presence of
long-range interactions (LRIs). In ordered regular lattices, where LRIs have a
clear geometrical meaning, their presence allow for hoppings between more
distant sites, yet with a smaller probability. In such cases, it is found that
LRIs do not affect the dependency of the mean square displacement (MSD)
traveled by the walker: exact analytical results for the the cycle graph within
the Markov chain framework shows that MSD follows the same linearly increasing
behavior with time when LRIs are absent, independently of the strength of LRI.
This contrasts with the superdiffusive scenario in complex networks. When they
have very short diameter ($\sim \log N$), the analysis of the time dependency
of MSD becomes quite difficult, as it saturates very quickly even when LRIs are
absent. The presence of a faster than linearly increasing growth phase can be
noticed, but it can hardly be measured with precision. This effect is
sidestepped on small-world Newman-Watts (NW) networks, where the network
diameter can be controlled by the number of new links (shortcuts) that are
added to the cycle graph. The time duration $t_f$ of the superdiffusive regime
and the power law exponent can be adequately evaluated by numerical methods.
They depend on the number of nodes and shortcuts, as well as the strength of
LRIs. Although the later causes a strong reduction in $t_f$ when shortcuts are
present, their presence by itself is not sufficient to trigger a superdiffusive
behavior.

global flow pattern consists of a shallow, swirling vortex combined with a
poloidal flow in the r-z plane which is predominantly inward near the bottom

that, as suggested by Oruba et al 2017, an eye forms at the centre of the

characterised by a local reversal in the direction of the poloidal flow. We
establish scaling laws for the flow and map out the conditions under which an

scales with V=(\alpha g \beta)^{1/2}H, where g is gravity, \alpha the expansion

millions of fielded photovoltaic (PV) modules may serve as a global testbed,
where we can interpret the routinely collected maximum power point (MPP)
time-series data to assess the time-dependent ""health"" thereof. The existing
characterization methods, however, cannot effectively mine/decode these
datasets to identify various degradation pathways of the corresponding solar
modules. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, i.e., the Suns-Vmp
method, which offers a simple and powerful approach to monitoring and
diagnosing time-dependent degradation of solar modules by physically mining the
MPP data. The algorithm reconstructs ""IV"" curves by using the natural
illumination- and temperature-dependent daily MPP characteristics as
constraints to fit the physics-based compact model. These synthetic IV
characteristics are then used to determine the time-dependent evolution of
circuit parameters (e.g., series resistance) which in-turn allows one to deduce
the dominant degradation mode (e.g., corrosion) for the modules. The proposed
method has been applied to analyze the MPP data from a test facility at the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Our analysis indicates that the
solar modules degraded at a rate of 0.7 %/year due to discoloration and
weakened solder bonds. These conclusions are independently validated by outdoor
IV measurement and on-site imaging characterization. Integrated with
physics-based degradation models or machine learning algorithms, the method can
also serve to predict the lifetime of PV systems.

problems is developed. The spectral approach is shown to converge to the true
exterior calculus in the limit of large data. Simultaneously, the spectral
approach decouples the memory requirements from the amount of data points and
ambient space dimension. To achieve this, the exterior calculus is reformulated
entirely in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian
operator on functions. The exterior derivatives of these eigenfunctions (and
their wedge products) are shown to form a frame (a type of spanning set) for
appropriate $L^2$ spaces of $k$-forms, as well as higher-order Sobolev spaces.
Formulas are derived to express the Laplace-de Rham operators on forms in terms
of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. By
representing the Laplace-de Rham operators in this frame, spectral convergence
results are obtained via Galerkin approximation techniques. Numerical examples
demonstrate accurate recovery of eigenvalues and eigenforms of the Laplace-de
Rham operator on 1-forms. The correct Betti numbers are obtained from the
kernel of this operator approximated from data sampled on several orientable
and non-orientable manifolds, and the eigenforms are visualized via their
corresponding vector fields. These vector fields form a natural orthonormal
basis for the space of square-integrable vector fields, and are ordered by a
Dirichlet energy functional which measures oscillatory behavior. The spectral
framework also shows promising results on a non-smooth example (the Lorenz 63
attractor), suggesting that a spectral formulation of exterior calculus may be
feasible in spaces with no differentiable structure.

size $O(\sqrt{p})$ (with typical main terms of order $p$).
  For non-generic $f$ we prove that independence still holds for ""generic"" set
of shifts. We can also exhibit examples for which there is no cancellation at
all in M\""obius/Chowla type sums (in fact, it turns out that (square root)
cancellation in M\""obius sums is {\em equivalent} to (square root) cancellation
in Chowla type sums), as well as intervals where the heuristic ""primes are

  The results are deduced from a general theorem on correlations of arithmetic
class functions; these include characteristic functions on primes, the M\""obius
$\mu$ function, and divisor functions (e.g., function field analogs of the
Titchmarsh divisor problem can be treated.) We also prove analogous, but
slightly weaker, results in the more delicate fixed characteristic setting,

scan time limitations may prohibit acquisition of certain contrasts, and images

ability to synthesize unacquired or corrupted contrasts from remaining
contrasts can improve diagnostic utility. For multi-contrast synthesis, current
methods learn a nonlinear intensity transformation between the source and
target images, either via nonlinear regression or deterministic neural
networks. These methods can in turn suffer from loss of high-spatial-frequency
information in synthesized images. Here we propose a new approach for
multi-contrast MRI synthesis based on conditional generative adversarial
networks. The proposed approach preserves high-frequency details via an
adversarial loss; and it offers enhanced synthesis performance via a pixel-wise
loss for registered multi-contrast images and a cycle-consistency loss for
unregistered images. Information from neighboring cross-sections are utilized
to further improved synthesis quality. Demonstrations on T1- and T2-weighted

ratio is only relevant when $m_A>m_H+m_Z$, but it is negligible otherwise. For
$m_A>600$ GeV and $t_\beta\simeq O(1)$, $BR(A\to Z\gamma\gamma)$ can reach
values of the order of $10^{-5}-10^{-4}$, but it decreases by about one order
of magnitude as $t_\beta$ increases up to 10. A similar behavior is followed by
the $H\to Z\gamma\gamma$ decay, which only has a non-negligible branching ratio

differential dynamic logic are complete for all algebraic invariants. Our proof
exploits differential ghosts, which introduce additional variables that can be
chosen to evolve freely along new differential equations. Cleverly chosen
differential ghosts are the proof-theoretical counterpart of dark matter. They
create new hypothetical state, whose relationship to the original state
variables satisfies invariants that did not exist before. The reflection of
these new invariants in the original system then enables its analysis.
  We then show that extending the axiomatization with existence and uniqueness
axioms makes it complete for all local progress properties, and further
extension with a real induction axiom makes it complete for all real arithmetic
invariants. This yields a parsimonious axiomatization, which serves as the
logical foundation for reasoning about invariants of differential equations.
Moreover, our results are purely axiomatic, and so the axiomatization is
suitable for sound implementation in foundational theorem provers.

screening methods may be a weak solution to these issues. We contribute a novel
robust joint screener to safeguard against outliers and distribution
mis-specification for both the response variable and the covariates, and to
account for external variables at the screening step. Specifically, we
introduce a copula-based partial correlation (CPC) screener. We show that the
empirical process of the estimated CPC converges weakly to a Gaussian process
and establish the sure screening property for CPC screener under very mild
technical conditions, where we need not require any moment condition, weaker
than existing alternatives in the literature. Moreover, our approach allows for
a diverging number of conditional variables from the theoretical point of view.
Extensive simulation studies and two data applications are included to
illustrate our proposal.

effective approach for detection and tracking of multiple moving objects with
occlusion. Moving targets are initially detected using a simple yet efficient
block matching technique, providing rough location information for multiple
object tracking. More accurate location information is then estimated for each
moving object by a nonlinear tracking algorithm. Considering the ambiguity
caused by the occlusion among multiple moving objects, we apply an unscented
Kalman filtering (UKF) technique for reliable object detection and tracking.
Different from conventional Kalman filtering (KF), which cannot achieve the
optimal estimation in nonlinear tracking scenarios, UKF can be used to track
both linear and nonlinear motions due to the unscented transform. Further, it
estimates the velocity information for each object to assist to the object
detection algorithm, effectively delineating multiple moving objects of
occlusion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can
correctly detect and track multiple moving objects with nonlinear motion

to transmit thoughts between individuals. However, language can represent only
a subset of our rich and detailed cognitive architecture. Here, we ask what
kinds of common knowledge (semantic memory) are captured by word meanings
(lexical semantics). We examine a prominent computational model that represents
words as vectors in a multidimensional space, such that proximity between
word-vectors approximates semantic relatedness. Because related words appear in
similar contexts, such spaces - called ""word embeddings"" - can be learned from
patterns of lexical co-occurrences in natural language. Despite their
popularity, a fundamental concern about word embeddings is that they appear to
be semantically ""rigid"": inter-word proximity captures only overall similarity,
yet human judgments about object similarities are highly context-dependent and
involve multiple, distinct semantic features. For example, dolphins and
alligators appear similar in size, but differ in intelligence and
aggressiveness. Could such context-dependent relationships be recovered from
word embeddings? To address this issue, we introduce a powerful, domain-general
solution: ""semantic projection"" of word-vectors onto lines that represent
various object features, like size (the line extending from the word ""small"" to
""big""), intelligence (from ""dumb"" to ""smart""), or danger (from ""safe"" to
""dangerous""). This method, which is intuitively analogous to placing objects
""on a mental scale"" between two extremes, recovers human judgments across a
range of object categories and properties. We thus show that word embeddings
inherit a wealth of common knowledge from word co-occurrence statistics and can
be flexibly manipulated to express context-dependent meanings.

In our
model, both of the two connected agents receive a benefit if they have the same
opinion, otherwise they both pay a cost. Agents update their opinions by
comparing payoffs with neighbors. The opinion of an agent with higher payoff is
more likely to be imitated. We apply this model in scale-free networks with
tunable degree distribution. Interestingly, we find that there exists an
optimal ratio of cost to benefit, leading to the shortest consensus time.
Qualitative analysis is obtained by examining the evolution of the opinion
clusters. Moreover, we find that the consensus time decreases as the average
degree of the network increases, but increases with the noise introduced to
permit irrational choices. The dependence of the consensus time on the network
size is found to be a power-law form. For small or larger ratio of cost to
benefit, the consensus time decreases as the degree exponent increases.
However, for moderate ratio of cost to benefit, the consensus time increases
with the degree exponent. Our results may provide new insights into opinion
dynamics driven by the evolutionary game theory.

field in the context of purely affine gravity and extend the study to
multifield dynamics. The coupling is performed via an affine connection and its
associated curvature without referring to any metric tensor. The latter arises
a posteriori and it may gain an emergent character like the scale of gravity.
What is remarkable in affine gravity is the transition from nonminimal to
minimal couplings which is realized by only field redefinition of the scalar
fields. Consequently, the inflationary models gain a unique description in this
context where the observed parameters, like the scalar tilt and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, are invariant under field reparametrization. Overall,
gravity in its affine approach is expected to reveal interesting and rich
phenomenology in cosmology and astroparticle physics.

calculation are adjusted to reproduce some fission observables, such as the
neutron emission multiplicity $\overline{\nu}$, its distribution $P(\nu)$, and
the mass dependence $\overline\nu(A)$. The calculated fission product yield and
isomeric ratio are compared with experimental data. We show that the calculated
independent fission product yield $Y_I(A)$ at the thermal energy reproduces the
experimental data well, while the calculated isomeric ratios tend to be lower
than the Madland-England model prediction. The model is extended to higher
incident neutron energies up to the second chance fission threshold. We
demonstrate for the first time that most of the isomeric ratios stay constant,

every agent assesses the epidemic situation and make decisions on whether it
should stay in or leave its current place. An agent will leave its current
place with a speed if the number of infected neighbors reaches or exceeds a
critical value $E$. Owing to the movement of agents, the network's structure is
dynamical. Interestingly, we find that there exists an optimal value of $E$
leading to the maximum epidemic threshold. This means that epidemic spreading
can be effectively controlled by risk-averse migration. Besides, we find that
the epidemic threshold increases as the recovering rate increases, decreases as
the contact radius increases, and is maximized by an optimal moving speed. Our

one unsteady minijet blowing in wall-normal direction close to the nozzle exit.
The flow is monitored with two hotwire sensors. The first sensor is positioned
on the centerline 5 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle exit, i.e. the end
of the potential core, while the second is located 3 jet diameters downstream
and displaced towards the shear-layer. The mixing performance is monitored with
mean velocity at the first sensor. A reduction of this velocity correlates with
increased entrainment near the potential core. Machine Learning Control (MLC)
is employed to optimize sensor feedback, a general open-loop broadband
frequency actuation and combinations of both. MLC has identified the optimal
periodic forcing with a small duty cycle as the best control policy employing
only 400 actuation measurements, each lasting for 5 seconds. This learning rate
is comparable if not faster than typical optimization of periodic forcing with
two free parameters (frequency and duty cycle). In addition, MLC results
indicate that neither new frequencies nor sensor feedback improves mixing
further-contrary to many of other turbulence control experiments. The
optimality of pure periodic actuation may be attributed to the simple jet
flapping mechanism in the minijet plane. The performance of sensor feedback is
shown to face a challenge for small duty cycles. The jet mixing results
demonstrate the untapped potential of MLC in quickly learning optimal general
control policies, even deciding between open- and closed-loop control.

It is due to the variability in conditions from data acquisition or
abnormalities in images, making brain morphology and intensity characteristics
changeable and complicated. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for skull
stripping in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, namely ASMCNN, by
combining the Active Shape Model (ASM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
for taking full of their advantages to achieve remarkable results. Instead of
working with 3D structures, we process 2D image sequences in the sagittal
plane. First, we divide images into different groups such that, in each group,
shapes and structures of brain boundaries have similar appearances. Second, a
modified version of ASM is used to detect brain boundaries by utilizing prior
knowledge of each group. Finally, CNN and post-processing methods, including
Conditional Random Field (CRF), Gaussian processes, and several special rules
are applied to refine the segmentation contours. Experimental results show that
our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms by a
significant margin in all experiments.

deflect incident light into a specific diffraction order with near-perfect
efficiency. While such asymmetry can be achieved in a variety of ways, e.g., by
using a sawtooth (blazed) geometry, a recently emerged approach is to use a
planar metagrating comprised of designer multi-resonant periodic units
(metamolecules). Here we demonstrate that a bianisotropic unit cell supporting
four resonances interfering in the far field can be used as a building block
for achieving the prefect deflection. A coupled mode analysis shows that these
modes provide a small number of orthogonal electromagnetic radiation patterns
that are needed to suppress transmission/reflection into all but one
diffraction order. Bianisotropy caused by a mirror symmetry breaking enables a
normally incident wave to excite, through near-field couplings, two otherwise
""dark"" resonant modes. We design and experimentally realize bianisotropic
metamolecules which are sub-wavelength in all three dimensions, and whose
optical properties are desensitized to fabrication imperfections by their
geometric simplicity. We show that optical beams tightly focused onto the
metagratings with just a few unit cells can also be asymmetrically deflected
with high efficiency, paving the way for compact broadband optical devices.

exceed 8 hours of shift the railroads may be penalized for over-tiring their

increased safety of train pilots. Cameras continuously capture video from

Track anomalies like vegetation overgrowth, sun kinks affect the track
construct and result in unequal load transfer, imbalanced lateral forces on
tracks which causes further deterioration of tracks and can ultimately result
in derailment of locomotive. Hence there is a need to continuously monitor rail
track health. Track anomalies are rare with the skew as high as one anomaly in
millions of good images. We propose a method to build training data that will
make our algorithms more robust and help us detect real world track issues. The
data augmentation will have a direct effect in making us detect better
anomalies and hence improve time for railroads that is spent in manual
inspection. This paper talks about a real world use case of detecting railway
track defects from a camera mounted on a moving locomotive and tracking their
locations. The camera is engineered to withstand the environment factors on a
moving train and provide a consistent steady image at around 30 frames per
second. An image simulation pipeline of track detection, region of interest
selection, augmenting image for anomalies is implemented. Training images are
simulated for sun kink and vegetation overgrowth. Inception V3 model pretrained
on Imagenet dataset is finetuned for a 2 class classification. For the case of
vegetation overgrowth, the model generalizes well on actual vegetation images,
though it was trained and validated solely on simulated images which might have
different distribution than the actual vegetation. Sun kink classifier can
classify professionally simulated sun kink videos with a precision of 97.5%.

given partition, and thereby maximizing the measure provides a principled way
of detecting communities in networks. Unfortunately, the exact optimization of
the measure is computationally NP-complete and only applicable to very small
networks. Approximation approaches have to be sought to scale to large
networks. To address the computational issue, we proposed a new method to
identify the partition decisions. Coupled with an iterative rounding strategy
and a fast constrained power method, our work achieves tight and effective
spectral relaxations. The proposed method was evaluated thoroughly on both real
and synthetic networks. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the method
obtained comparable, if not better, qualities. Meanwhile, it is highly suitable
for parallel execution and reported a nearly linear improvement in running
speed when increasing the number of computing nodes, which thereby provides a
practical tool for partitioning very large networks.

  Cloud Computing",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing popularity of cloud computing has resulted in a proliferation
of data centers. Effective placement of data centers improves network
performance and minimizes clients' perceived latency. The problem of
determining the optimal placement of data centers in a large network is a
classical uncapacitated $k$-median problem. Traditional works have focused on
centralized algorithms, which requires knowledge of the overall network
topology and information about the customers' service demands. Moreover,
centralized algorithms are computationally expensive and do not scale well with
the size of the network. We propose a fully distributed algorithm with linear
complexity to optimize the locations of data centers. The proposed algorithm
utilizes an iterative two-step optimization approach. Specifically, in each
iteration, it first partitions the whole network into $k$ regions through a
distributed partitioning algorithm; then within each region, it determines the
local approximate optimal location through a distributed message-passing
algorithm. When the underlying network is a tree topology, we show that the
overall cost is monotonically decreasing between successive iterations and the
proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations. Extensive
simulations on both synthetic and real Internet topologies show that the
proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable with that of centralized
algorithms that require global information and have higher computational
complexity.

fundamental tradeoff between achievable rate and harvested energy exists
because the received power is used for two different purposes. The tradeoff is
well characterized by the rate-energy region, and several techniques have been
proposed to improve the achievable rate-energy region. However, the existing
techniques still have a considerable loss in either energy or rate and thus the
known achievable rate-energy regions are far from the ideal one. Deriving tight
upper and lower bounds on the rate-energy region of our proposed scheme, we
prove that the rate-energy region can be expanded almost to the ideal upper
bound. Contrary to the existing techniques, in the proposed scheme, the
information decoding circuit not only extracts amplitude and phase information
but also combines the extracted information with the amplitude information
obtained from the rectified signal. Consequently, the required energy for
decoding can be minimized, and thus the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal
rate-energy region, which implies that the fundamental tradeoff in the
achievable rate-energy region is nearly eliminated. To practically account for
the theoretically achievable rate-energy region, we also present practical
examples with an $M$-ary multi-level circular QAM with Gaussian maximum

resource exploration interest, but small airless bodies gradually lose their
ice to space by outward diffusion. Here, we quantitatively estimate the time it
takes a porous airless body to lose all of its interior ice, based on an
analytic solution for the interior temperature field of bodies in stable
orbits. Without latent heat, the average surface temperature, which is lower
than the classic effective temperature, is representative of the body interior
and hence an appropriate temperature to evaluate desiccation time scales. In a
spherically averaged model, an explicit analytic solution is obtained for the
depth to ice as a function of time and the time to complete desiccation. Half
of the ice volume is lost after 11% of this time. A bilobate structure emerges
from the strong latitude dependence of desiccation rates. Cold polar regions
can harbor subsurface ice, even when the body center does not. Latent heat
retards ice loss, and we obtain a succinct expression for the temperature
difference between the surface and the ice. In the outer main belt, nearly all
bodies 10~km in size or larger should have been able to retain ice in their
interiors over the age of the solar system. Each of the following factors
favors the presence of ice inside NEOs: a semi-major axis in the outer belt or
beyond, a mantle of very low thermal inertia, a young age, or a small and
stable axis tilt.

independent test set of 379 images was used to rank the participants. This
article demonstrates the impact of ranking criteria, segmentation method and
classifier, and highlights the clinical perspective. We compare five different
measures for diagnostic accuracy by analysing the resulting ranking of the
computer systems in the challenge. Choice of performance measure had great
impact on the ranking. Systems that were ranked among the top three for one
measure, dropped to the bottom half when changing performance measure. Nevus
Doctor, a computer system previously developed by the authors, was used to
investigate the impact of segmentation and classifier. The unexpected small
impact of automatic versus semi-automatic/manual segmentation suggests that
improvements of the automatic segmentation method w.r.t. resemblance to
semi-automatic/manual segmentation will not improve diagnostic accuracy
substantially. A small set of similar classification algorithms are used to
investigate the impact of classifier on the diagnostic accuracy. The
variability in diagnostic accuracy for different classifier algorithms was
larger than the variability for segmentation methods, and suggests a focus for
future investigations. From a clinical perspective, the misclassification of a
melanoma as benign has far greater cost than the misclassification of a benign
lesion. For computer systems to have clinical impact, their performance should
be ranked by a high-sensitivity measure.

several non-trivial randomized truthful mechanisms, and also allows for

classic experiment design problems in the online setting, with the algorithm
deciding whether to allocate budget to each experiment as new experiments

  We analyze two greedy primal-dual algorithms and provide bounds on their

we obtain a convex parametrization of the family of functions satisfying

offline before the data start arriving. The online algorithm that uses the
designed smoothing is tailored to the given cost function, and enjoys a

complete annihilation of even order dispersion effects, and that at all sample

demanding 'balanced detection' configuration based on using two detectors. We
demonstrate intensity correlation (IC) OCT using a conventional spectral domain

cross term ghost images and a reduced axial range, half of that of conventional
SD-OCT. We demonstrate that both shortcomings can be removed by applying a
novel generic artefact reduction algorithm and using analytic interferograms.
We show the superiority of IC-SD-OCT compared to conventional SD-OCT by showing
how IC-SD-OCT is able to image spatial structures behind a strongly dispersive
silicon wafer. Finally, we question the resolution enhancement of square root 2
that IC-SD-OCT is often believed to have compared to SD-OCT. We show that this

profile in a pipe can lead to a complete collapse of turbulence and the flow
fully relaminarizes. Two different devices, a stationary obstacle (inset) and a
device to inject additional fluid through an annular gap close to the wall, are
used to control the flow. Both devices modify the streamwise velocity profile
such that the flow in the center of the pipe is decelerated and the flow in the
near wall region is accelerated. We present measurements with stereoscopic
particle image velocimetry to investigate and capture the development of the
relaminarizing flow downstream these devices and the specific circumstances
responsible for relaminarization. We find total relaminarization up to Reynolds
numbers of 6000, where the pressure drop in the downstream distance is reduced
by a factor of 3.4 due to relaminarization. In a smooth straight pipe the flow
remains completely laminar downstream of the control. Furthermore, we show that
transient (temporary) relaminarization in a spatially confined region right
downstream the devices occurs also at much higher Reynolds numbers, accompanied
by a significant drag reduction. The underlying physical mechanism of
relaminarization is attributed to a weakening of the near-wall turbulence
production cycle.

$p=\frac{1}{3}\left( {\rho}-4\,B \right)$, where $B$ is the bag constant and
the distribution of the electrical charge is given as
$q(r)=Q\left({r}/{R}\right)^3=\alpha {r^3}$, where $\alpha$ is a constant. To
this end, to calculate different constants we have described the exterior
spacetime by the Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m metric. By using the values of the
observed mass for the different strange star candidates we have maximized
anisotropic stress at the surface to predict the exact values of the radius for
the different values of $\alpha$ and a specific value of the bag constant.
Further, we perform different tests to study the physical validity and the
stability of the proposed stellar model. We found accumulation of the electric
charge distribution is maximum at the surface having electric charge of the
order ${{10}^{20}}~C$ and electric field of the order ${10}^{21-22}~V/cm$. To

the rotational dynamics of interstellar asteroids (ISAs) of irregular shapes

important for the dynamics and destruction of ISAs. Mechanical torques can spin
up the ISA, resulting in the breakup of the original ISA into small binary
asteroids when the rotation rate exceeds the critical frequency. We find that
the breakup timescale is short for ISAs of highly irregular shapes and low
tensile strength. We apply our results to the first observed ISA, `Oumuamua,

the binary fragments due to gravity along its journey in the interstellar

disruption due to mechanical torques. Finally, we discuss the survival

for the length of the shortest (in terms of total length) such paths. Similarly
the search and counting versions ask for one such and the number of such

  We restrict attention to the shortest $k$-DPP instances on undirected planar
graphs where all sources and sinks lie on a single face or on a pair of faces.
We provide efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for the search versions
of the problem answering one of the main open questions raised by Colin de
Verdiere and Schrijver for the general one-face problem. We do so by providing
a randomised $NC^2$ algorithm along with an $O(n^{\omega})$ time randomised

  In contrast, previously, only the sequential complexity of decision and

constantly many terminals. In addition, the earlier best known sequential
algorithms (e.g. Borradaile et al.) were randomised while ours are also
deterministic.
  The algorithms are based on a bijection between a shortest $k$-tuple of
disjoint paths in the given graph and cycle covers in a related digraph. This
allows us to non-trivially modify established techniques relating counting
cycle covers to the determinant. We further need to do a controlled
inclusion-exclusion to produce a polynomial sum of determinants such that all

colder temperatures, lower loading frequencies, and impurities in the ice

environments is a highly challenging problem. Our approach to it involves a
team of cooperating micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) with on-board cameras only.
The key enabling-aspect of our approach is the on-board person detection and
tracking method. Recent state-of-the-art methods based on deep neural networks
(DNN) are highly promising in this context. However, real time DNNs are
severely constrained in input data dimensions, in contrast to available camera
resolutions. Therefore, DNNs often fail at objects with small scale or far away
from the camera, which are typical characteristics of a scenario with aerial
robots. Thus, the core problem addressed in this paper is how to achieve
on-board, real-time, continuous and accurate vision-based detections using DNNs
for visual person tracking through MAVs. Our solution leverages cooperation
among multiple MAVs. First, each MAV fuses its own detections with those
obtained by other MAVs to perform cooperative visual tracking. This allows for
predicting future poses of the tracked person, which are used to selectively
process only the relevant regions of future images, even at high resolutions.
Consequently, using our DNN-based detector we are able to continuously track
even distant humans with high accuracy and speed. We demonstrate the efficiency
of our approach through real robot experiments involving two aerial robots
tracking a person, while maintaining an active perception-driven formation. Our
solution runs fully on-board our MAV's CPU and GPU, with no remote processing.

high-resolution Fourier-transform spectrometer for various pressure,
temperature and concentration conditions. The continuum absorption by CO2 due
to the presence of water vapor was determined by subtracting from measured
spectra the contribution of local lines of both species, that of the continuum
of pure CO2 as well as of the self- and CO2-continua of water vapor induced by
the H2O-H2O and H2O-CO2 interactions. The obtained results are in very good
agreement with the unique previous measurement (in a narrower spectral range).
They confirm that the H2O-continuum of CO2 is significantly larger than that
observed for pure CO2. This continuum thus must be taken into account in
radiative transfer calculations for media involving CO2+H2O mixture. An
empirical model, using sub-Lorentzian line shapes based on some
temperature-dependent correction factors chi is proposed which enables an

largest classes of functions that can be pre or post composed to limit

We transfer these observations to the lattice of represented spaces where it

that Lipschitz continuous functions that are limit computable are automatically

existing theorem over these linear codes, deterministic sensing matrices are
constructed. To evaluate this procedure, two examples of constructed sensing
matrices are presented. The first example contains a matrix of size
${{p}^{2}}\times {{p}^{3}}$ and coherence ${1}/{p}\;$, and the second one
comprises a matrix with the size $p\left( p-1 \right)\times {{p}^{3}}$ and
coherence ${1}/{\left( p-1 \right)}\;$, where $p$ is a prime integer. Based on
the Welch bound, both examples asymptotically achieve optimal results.
Moreover, by presenting a new theorem, the column replacement is used for
resizing any sensing matrix to a greater-size sensing matrix whose coherence is
calculated. Then, using an example, the outperformance of the proposed method
is compared to a well-known method. Simulation results show the satisfying
performance of the column replacement method either in created or resized

networks, i.e., impacting on their performance no more than another WiFi
device, and ($ii$) achieving superior airtime efficiency as compared to WiFi.
In this paper we show the standardized LAA fails to simultaneously fulfill
these objectives, and design an alternative orthogonal (collision-free)
listen-before-talk coexistence paradigm that provides a substantial improvement
in performance, yet imposes no penalty on existing WiFi networks. We derive two
LAA optimal transmission policies, ORLA and OLAA, that maximize LAA throughput

proposals can attain 100% higher throughput, without harming WiFi. We further
show that long U-LTE frames incur up to 92% throughput losses on WiFi when
using 3GPP LAA, whilst ORLA/OLAA sustain $>$200% gains at no cost, even in the
presence of non-saturated WiFi and/or in multi-rate scenarios.

bunch-by-bunch measurements of injection backgrounds and measurements sensitive
to the energy spectrum and angular distribution of fast neutrons. We observe
beam-gas, Touschek, beam-dust, and injection backgrounds. We do not observe
significant synchrotron radiation, as expected. Measured LER beam-gas
backgrounds and Touschek backgrounds in both rings are slightly elevated, on
average three times larger than the levels predicted by simulation. HER
beam-gas backgrounds are on on average two orders of magnitude larger than
predicted. Systematic uncertainties and channel-to-channel variations are
large, so that these excesses constitute only 1-2 sigma level effects. Neutron
background rates are higher than predicted and should be studied further. We
will measure the remaining beam background processes, due to colliding beams,

Using the $su(2|2)^2$ symmetry we determine the two magnon $S$-matrix and
demonstrate that it agrees, up to two loops, with a weak coupling computation
performed in the CFT. We also compute the first finite size corrections to both
the magnon and the dyonic magnon by constructing solutions to the Nambu-Goto
action that carry finite angular momentum. These finite size computations
constitute a strong coupling confirmation of the proposal.

The TRAPPIST-1 system hosts seven Earth-sized, temperate exoplanets
orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star. As such, it represents a remarkable setting
to study the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets that formed in the
same protoplanetary disk. While the sizes of the TRAPPIST-1 planets are all
known to better than 5% precision, their densities have significant
uncertainties (between 28% and 95%) because of poor constraints on the planet's
masses. Aims.The goal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the
TRAPPIST-1 planetary masses and densities using transit-timing variations
(TTV). The complexity of the TTV inversion problem is known to be particularly
acute in multi-planetary systems (convergence issues, degeneracies and size of
the parameter space), especially for resonant chain systems such as TRAPPIST-1.
Methods. To overcome these challenges, we have used a novel method that employs
a genetic algorithm coupled to a full N-body integrator that we applied to a
set of 284 individual transit timings. This approach enables us to efficiently
explore the parameter space and to derive reliable masses and densities from
TTVs for all seven planets. Results. Our new masses result in a five- to
eight-fold improvement on the planetary density uncertainties, with precisions
ranging from 5% to 12%. These updated values provide new insights into the bulk
structure of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We find that TRAPPIST-1\,c and e likely
have largely rocky interiors, while planets b, d, f, g, and h require envelopes
of volatiles in the form of thick atmospheres, oceans, or ice, in most cases
with water mass fractions less than 5%.

work in teams. To increase organizational productivity, it is thus crucial to
know the factors that affect team effectiveness. Two team-related concepts that
have gained prominence lately are psychological safety and team norms. Still,
few studies exist that explore these in a software engineering context.
  Therefore, with the aim of extending the knowledge of these concepts, we
examined if psychological safety and team norm clarity associate positively
with software developers' self-assessed team performance and job satisfaction,
two important elements of effectiveness.
  We collected industry survey data from practitioners (N = 217) in 38
development teams working for five different organizations. The result of
multiple linear regression analyses indicates that both psychological safety
and team norm clarity predict team members' self-assessed performance and job
satisfaction. The findings also suggest that clarity of norms is a stronger
(30\% and 71\% stronger, respectively) predictor than psychological safety.
  This research highlights the need to examine, in more detail, the
relationship between social norms and software development. The findings of
this study could serve as an empirical baseline for such, future work.

capability of feature engineering. It yields state-of-the-art performance in
various batch learning tasks where all the training data is made available
prior to the training. However, in real-world applications where the data
arrives sequentially in a streaming manner, the high cost of re-training with
batch learning algorithms has posed formidable challenges in the online
learning scenario. The initial challenge is that no prior formulations of FM
could fulfill the requirements in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) -- the
paramount framework for online learning algorithm design. To address the
aforementioned challenge, we invent a new convexification scheme leading to a
Compact Convexified FM (CCFM) that seamlessly meets the requirements in OCO.
However for learning Compact Convexified FM (CCFM) in the online learning
setting, most existing algorithms suffer from expensive projection operations.
To address this subsequent challenge, we follow the general projection-free
algorithmic framework of Online Conditional Gradient and propose an Online
Compact Convex Factorization Machine (OCCFM) algorithm that eschews the
projection operation with efficient linear optimization steps. In support of
the proposed OCCFM in terms of its theoretical foundation, we prove that the
developed algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound. To evaluate the
empirical performance of OCCFM, we conduct extensive experiments on 6
real-world datasets for online recommendation and binary classification tasks.
The experimental results show that OCCFM outperforms the state-of-art online

  Principal Ideal Domains","17 pages, accepted for the special issue of Mathematics for Computer
  Science for the conference ACA 2018",,,,"cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Signature-based algorithms have become a standard approach for Gr\""obner
basis computations for polynomial systems over fields, but how to extend these
techniques to coefficients in general rings is not yet as well understood.
  In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept signature-based algorithm for
computing Gr\""obner bases over commutative integral domains. It is adapted from
a general version of M\""oller's algorithm (1988) which considers reductions by
multiple polynomials at each step. This algorithm performs reductions with
non-decreasing signatures, and in particular, signature drops do not occur.
When the coefficients are from a principal ideal domain (e.g. the ring of
integers or the ring of univariate polynomials over a field), we prove
correctness and termination of the algorithm, and we show how to use signature
properties to implement classic signature-based criteria to eliminate some
redundant reductions. In particular, if the input is a regular sequence, the
algorithm operates without any reduction to 0.
  We have written a toy implementation of the algorithm in Magma. Early
experimental results suggest that the algorithm might even be correct and
terminate in a more general setting, for polynomials over a unique
factorization domain (e.g. the ring of multivariate polynomials over a field or
a PID).

become a subject of intense study. Deep models, typically over-parametrized,
tend to fit the training data exactly. Despite this ""overfitting"", they perform
well on test data, a phenomenon not yet fully understood.
  The first point of our paper is that strong performance of overfitted
classifiers is not a unique feature of deep learning. Using six real-world and
two synthetic datasets, we establish experimentally that kernel machines
trained to have zero classification or near zero regression error perform very
well on test data, even when the labels are corrupted with a high level of
noise. We proceed to give a lower bound on the norm of zero loss solutions for
smooth kernels, showing that they increase nearly exponentially with data size.
We point out that this is difficult to reconcile with the existing
generalization bounds. Moreover, none of the bounds produce non-trivial results
for interpolating solutions.
  Second, we show experimentally that (non-smooth) Laplacian kernels easily fit
random labels, a finding that parallels results for ReLU neural networks. In
contrast, fitting noisy data requires many more epochs for smooth Gaussian
kernels. Similar performance of overfitted Laplacian and Gaussian classifiers
on test, suggests that generalization is tied to the properties of the kernel
function rather than the optimization process.
  Certain key phenomena of deep learning are manifested similarly in kernel
methods in the modern ""overfitted"" regime. The combination of the experimental
and theoretical results presented in this paper indicates a need for new
theoretical ideas for understanding properties of classical kernel methods. We
argue that progress on understanding deep learning will be difficult until more
tractable ""shallow"" kernel methods are better understood.

molecular diffusion in the firn column, where the magnitude of the diffusion is
isotopologoue specific and temperature dependent. By utilizing the differential
diffusion signal, dual isotope measurements of $\delta{}^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and
$\delta\mathrm{D}$ enable multiple temperature reconstruction techniques. This
study assesses how well six different methods can be used to reconstruct past
surface temperatures from the diffusion-based temperature proxies. Two of the
methods are based on the single diffusion lengths of $\delta{}^{18}\mathrm{O}$
and $\delta\mathrm{D}$, three of the methods employ the differential diffusion
signal, while the last uses the ratio between the single diffusion lengths. All
techniques are tested on synthetic data in order to evaluate their accuracy and
precision. We perform a benchmark test to thirteen high resolution Holocene
data sets from Greenland and Antarctica, which represent a broad range of mean
annual surface temperatures and accumulation rates. Based on the benchmark
test, we comment on the accuracy and precision of the methods. Both the
benchmark test and the synthetic data test demonstrate that the most precise
reconstructions are obtained when using the single isotope diffusion lengths,
with precisions of approximately $1.0\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. In the benchmark
test, the single isotope diffusion lengths are also found to reconstruct
consistent temperatures with a root-mean-square-deviation of
$0.7\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$.

definition is motivated by the fact that the convergence rate of the
generalized minimal residual method for the corresponding linear systems is
determined by the ratio. An upper bound for the ratio is established by
developing an upper bound for the maximal singular value and a lower bound for

depends on three factors, the number of the elements in the mesh, the mesh
nonuniformity measured in the Euclidean metric, and the mesh nonuniformity

2-body, 3-body and many-body kernel functions on a set of 19-atom Ni cluster
structures. We find that 2-body GP kernels fail to provide faithful force
estimates, despite succeeding in bulk Ni systems. However, both 3- and
many-body kernels predict forces within a $\sim$0.1 eV/$\text{\AA}$ average
error even for small training datasets, and achieve high accuracy even on
out-of-sample, high temperature, structures. While training and testing on the
same structure always provides satisfactory accuracy, cross-testing on
dissimilar structures leads to higher prediction errors, posing an
extrapolation problem. This can be cured using heterogeneous training on
databases that contain more than one structure, which results in a good
trade-off between versatility and overall accuracy. Starting from a 3-body
kernel trained this way, we build an efficient non-parametric 3-body force
field that allows accurate prediction of structural properties at finite
temperatures, following a newly developed scheme [Glielmo et al. PRB 97, 184307
(2018)]. We use this to assess the thermal stability of Ni$_{19}$ nanoclusters
at a fractional cost of full ab initio calculations.

  treatment duration",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: trials to identify the minimal effective treatment duration are
needed in different therapeutic areas, including bacterial infections, TB and
Hepatitis--C. However, standard non-inferiority designs have several
limitations, including arbitrariness of non-inferiority margins, choice of
research arms and very large sample sizes.
  Methods: we recast the problem of finding an appropriate non-inferior
treatment duration in terms of modelling the entire duration-response curve
within a pre-specified range. We propose a multi-arm randomised trial design,
allocating patients to different treatment durations. We use fractional
polynomials and spline-based methods to flexibly model the duration-response
curve. We compare different methods in terms of a scaled version of the area
between true and estimated prediction curves. We evaluate sensitivity to key
design parameters, including sample size, number and position of arms.
  Results: a total sample size of $\sim 500$ patients divided into a moderate
number of equidistant arms (5-7) is sufficient to estimate the
duration-response curve within a $5\%$ error margin in $95\%$ of the
simulations. Fractional polynomials provide similar or better results than
spline-based methods in most scenarios.
  Conclusions: our proposed practical randomised trial design is an alternative
to standard non-inferiority designs, avoiding many of their limitations, and
yet being fairly robust to different possible duration-response curves. The
trial outcome is the whole duration-response curve, which could be used by
clinicians and policy makers to make informed decisions, facilitating a move
away from a forced binary hypothesis testing paradigm.

investigated in the present work by the example of the 3D Taylor-Green vortex
problem. Our implementation is based on a generic high-performance framework
for matrix-free evaluation of finite element operators with one of the best
realizations currently known. We present a methodology to systematically
analyze the efficiency of the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver for high
polynomial degrees. Due to the absence of optimal rates of convergence in the
under-resolved regime, our results reveal that demonstrating improved
efficiency of high-order methods is a challenging task and that optimal
computational complexity of solvers, preconditioners, and matrix-free
implementations are necessary ingredients to achieve the goal of better
solution quality at the same computational costs already for a geometrically
simple problem such as the Taylor-Green vortex. Although the analysis is
performed for a Cartesian geometry, our approach is generic and can be applied
to arbitrary geometries. We present excellent performance numbers on modern,

evaluation of 3e8 up to 1e9 DoFs/sec on one Intel Haswell node with 28 cores.
Compared to performance results published within the last 5 years for

and is increasingly applied to dermatological research. A key dermatological
parameter inferred from an OCT image is the epidermal (Ep) thickness as a
thickened Ep can be an indicator of a skin disease. Agreement in the literature
on the signal characters of Ep and the subjacent skin layer, the dermis (D), is
evident. Ambiguities of the OCT signal interpretation in the literature is
however seen for the transition region between the Ep and D, which from
histology is known as the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ); a distinct junction
comprised by the lower surface of a single cell layer in epidermis connected to
an even thinner basement membrane, attached to the underlying dermis. In this
work we investigate the impact of an improved axial and lateral resolution on
the applicability of OCT for imaging of the skin. To this goal, OCT images are
compared produced by a commercial OCT system and by an in-house built ultrahigh
resolution (UHR-) OCT system for dermatology. In 11 healthy volunteers, we
investigate the DEJ signal characteristics. We perform a detailed analysis of
the dark (low) signal band clearly seen for UHR-OCT in the DEJ region where we,
by using a transition function, find the signal transition of axial
sub-resolution character, which can be directly attributed to the exact
location of DEJ, both in normal (thin/hairy) and glabrous (thick) skin. For
selected healthy volunteers, we investigate the dermal papillae and the vellus
hairs and identify distinct features that only UHR-OCT can resolve. Differences
are seen in tracing hairs of diameter below 20mm, and in imaging the dermal
papillae where capillary structures are identified in the hand palm, not
previously reported in OCT studies and specifically for glabrous skin not
reported in any other in vivo optical imaging studies.

powerful approach in this category of restoration algorithms is the popular
Expected Patch Log-Likelihood (EPLL) algorithm. EPLL uses a Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) prior learned on clean image patches as a way to regularize
degraded patches. In this paper, we show that a generalized Gaussian mixture
model (GGMM) captures the underlying distribution of patches better than a GMM.
Even though GGMM is a powerful prior to combine with EPLL, the non-Gaussianity
of its components presents major challenges to be applied to a computationally
intensive process of image restoration. Specifically, each patch has to undergo
a patch classification step and a shrinkage step. These two steps can be
efficiently solved with a GMM prior but are computationally impractical when
using a GGMM prior. In this paper, we provide approximations and computational
recipes for fast evaluation of these two steps, so that EPLL can embed a GGMM
prior on an image with more than tens of thousands of patches. Our main
contribution is to analyze the accuracy of our approximations based on thorough
theoretical analysis. Our evaluations indicate that the GGMM prior is
consistently a better fit formodeling image patch distribution and performs
better on average in image denoising task.

rays may play an important role, they can be best traced with low-frequency

present a study of the nearby star burst dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 using
observations at 140 MHz with the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR), at 1580 MHz with
the Very Large Array (VLA) and at 6200 MHz with the VLA and the 100-m
Effelsberg telescope. We find that IC 10 has a low-frequency radio halo, which
manifests itself as a second component (thick disc) in the minor axis profiles
of the non-thermal radio continuum emission at 140 and 1580 MHz. These profiles
are then fitted with 1D cosmic-ray transport models for pure diffusion and
advection. We find that a diffusion model fits best, with a diffusion
coefficient of $D=(0.4$-$0.8) \times 10^{26}(E/{\rm GeV})^{0.5}~{\rm
cm^2\,s^{-1}}$, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than estimates
both from anisotropic diffusion and the diffusion length. In contrast,
advection models, which cannot be ruled out due to the mild inclination, while
providing poorer fits, result in advection speeds close to the escape velocity
of $\approx$$50~\rm km\,s^{-1}$, as expected for a cosmic-ray driven wind. Our
favoured model with an accelerating wind provides a self-consistent solution,
where the magnetic field is in energy equipartition with both the warm neutral
and warm ionized medium with an important contribution from cosmic rays.
Consequently, cosmic rays can play a vital role for the launching of galactic
winds in the disc--halo interface.

significant part of this energy is dissipated as heat. Plasmonic losses present
a major hurdle in the development of plasmonic devices and circuits that can
compete with other mature technologies. Until recently, they have largely kept
the use of plasmonics to a few niche areas where loss is not a key factor, such
as surface enhanced Raman scattering and biochemical sensing. Here, we discuss
the origin of plasmonic losses and various approaches to either minimize or
mitigate them based on understanding of fundamental processes underlying
surface plasmon modes excitation and decay. Along with the ongoing effort to
find and synthesize better plasmonic materials, optical designs that modify the
optical powerflow through plasmonic nanostructures can help in reducing both
radiative damping and dissipative losses of surface plasmons. Another strategy
relies on the development of hybrid photonic-plasmonic devices by coupling
plasmonic nanostructures to resonant optical elements. Hybrid integration not
only helps to reduce dissipative losses and radiative damping of surface
plasmons, but also makes possible passive radiative cooling of nano-devices.
Finally, we review emerging applications of thermoplasmonics that leverage
Ohmic losses to achieve new enhanced functionalities. The most successful
commercialized example of a loss-enabled novel application of plasmonics is
heat-assisted magnetic recording. Other promising technological directions
include thermal emission manipulation, cancer therapy, nanofabrication,
nano-manipulation, plasmon-enabled material spectroscopy and thermo-catalysis,

results, although the relative bar pattern speeds are still faster than

investigate several regularization schemes that explicitly promote the

most accurate KE functionals are non-local functionals based on the
linear-response kernel of the homogeneous electron gas, i.e. the jellium model.
Here, we use the linear-response kernel of the jellium-with-gap model, to
construct a simple non-local KE functional (named KGAP) which depends on the
band gap energy. In the limit of vanishing energy-gap (i.e. in the case of
metals), the KGAP is equivalent to the Smargiassi-Madden (SM) functional, which
is accurate for metals. For a series of semiconductors (with different
energy-gaps), the KGAP performs much better than SM, and results are close to
the state-of-the-art functionals with complicated density-dependent kernels.

the deadliest among them. RCM is an effective, non-invasive pre-screening tool
for skin cancer diagnosis, with the required cellular resolution. However,
images are complex, low-contrast, and highly variable, so that clinicians
require months to years of expert-level training to be able to make accurate
assessments. In this paper, we address classifying 4 key clinically important
structural/textural patterns in RCM images. The occurrence and morphology of
these patterns are used by clinicians for diagnosis of melanomas. The large
size of RCM images, the large variance of pattern size, the large-scale range
over which patterns appear, the class imbalance in collected images, and the
lack of fully-labeled images all make this a challenging problem to address,
even with automated machine learning tools. We designed a novel nested U-net
architecture to cope with these challenges, and a selective loss function to
handle partial labeling. Trained and tested on 56 melanoma-suspicious,
partially labeled, 12k x 12k pixel images, our network automatically annotated
diagnostic patterns with high sensitivity and specificity, providing consistent
labels for unlabeled sections of the test images. Providing such annotation
will aid clinicians in achieving diagnostic accuracy, and perhaps more
important, dramatically facilitate clinical training, thus enabling much more
rapid adoption of RCM into widespread clinical use process. In addition, our
adaptation of U-net architecture provides an intrinsically multiresolution deep

site, the PM concentration increases dramatically, especially for particles
smaller than 2 microns. Image analysis from the c-Air portable device also
shows that the increased PM is comparatively strongly absorbing and asymmetric,
with an aspect ratio of 0.5-0.7. These PM features indicate that a major

foundations to support the development of extended models intended to go deeper
into the molecular mechanisms of DNA functioning.

streams. A stream of cars is using a primary road, and has priority over the
other stream. Cars belonging to the latter stream cross the primary road if the
gaps between two subsequent cars on the primary road are larger than their
critical headways. A question that naturally arises relates to the capacity of
the secondary road: given the arrival pattern of cars on the primary road, what
is the maximum arrival rate of low-priority cars that can be sustained? This
paper addresses this issue by considering a compact model that sheds light on
the dynamics of the considered unsignalized intersection. The model, which is
of a queueing-theoretic nature, reveals interesting insights into the impact of
the user behavior on stability.
  The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we obtain new results
for the aforementioned model that includes driver impatience. Secondly, we
reveal some surprising aspects that have remained unobserved in the existing
literature so far, many of which are caused by the fact that the capacity of
the minor road cannot be expressed in terms of the \emph{mean} gap size;
instead more detailed characteristics of the critical headway distribution play
a crucial role. The third contribution is the introduction of a new form of
bunching on the main road, called Markov platooning. The tractability of this
model allows us to study the impact of various platoon formations on the main
road on the capacity of the minor road.

analysis showed that the rise conforms to 7-9 % per one order of the energy
from 0.2 TeV (accelerators with fixed targets) to 10 PeV (EAS cosmic rays).
That corresponds to around 350 mb at 1 PeV and 380 mb at 10 PeV of primary

  Manufacturing",,,,"eess.SP cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, the utilization of rotating parts, e.g. bearings and gears,
has been continuously supporting the manufacturing line to produce consistent
output quality. Due to their critical role, the breakdown of these components
might significantly impact the production rate. A proper condition based
monitoring (CBM) is among a few ways to maintain and monitor the rotating
systems. Prognosis, as one of the major tasks in CBM that predicts and
estimates the remaining useful life of the machine, has attracted significant
interest in decades. This paper presents a literature review on prognosis
approaches from published papers in the last decade. The prognostic approaches
are described comprehensively to provide a better idea on how to select an
appropriate prognosis method for specific needs. An advanced predictive
analytics, namely Parsimonious Network Based on Fuzzy Inference System
(PANFIS), was proposed and tested into the low speed slew bearing data. PANFIS
differs itself from conventional prognostic approaches in which it supports for
online lifelong prognostics without the requirement of retraining or
reconfiguration phase. The method is applied to normal-to-failure bearing
vibration data collected for 139 days and to predict the time-domain features
of vibration slew bearing signals. The performance of the proposed method is
compared to some established methods such as ANFIS, eTS, and Simp_eTS. From the
results, it is suggested that PANFIS offers outstanding performance compared to
those of other methods.

artifacts which need to be removed for extracting meaningful clinical
information from them. Typically a priori knowledge of the nature of the
artifacts is needed for such purpose. Artifact contamination of EEG is even
more prominent for pervasive EEG systems where the subjects are free to move
and thereby introducing a wide variety of motion-related artifacts. This makes
hard to get a priori knowledge about their characteristics rendering
conventional artifact removal techniques often ineffective. In this paper, we
explore the performance of two hybrid artifact removal algorithms: Wavelet
packet transform followed by Independent Component Analysis (WPTICA) and
Wavelet Packet Transform followed by Empirical Mode Decomposition (WPTEMD) in
pervasive EEG recording scenario, assuming existence of no a priori knowledge
about the artifacts and compare their performance with two existing artifact
removal algorithms. Artifact cleaning performance has been measured using Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Artifact to Signal Ratio (ASR) - an index similar
to traditional Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and also by observing normalized
power distribution topography over the scalp. Comparison has been made first
using semi-simulated signals and then with real experimentally acquired EEG
data with commercially available 19-channel pervasive EEG system Enobio
corrupted by eight types of artifact. Our explorations show that WPTEMD
consistently gives best artifact cleaning performance not only in
semi-simulated scenario but also in the case of real EEG data containing
artifacts.

commercial needs. One of the major issues in cloud computing is the difficulty
to manage federated identities and the trust between the user and the service
providers. This paper focuses on how security can be provided between the user
and the service provider and how the user information can be authenticated. For
the purpose of providing privacy and authentication, Security Assertion Markup
Language (SAML) based Single Sign-On is used. Security is provided by using
Hash based Encryption algorithm (HBE). HBE algorithm works with the help of Key
Exchange Protocol which contains poly hash function. In the algorithm, Identity
providers maintain user directory and authenticates user information; service
provider provides the service to users. The user has to register their details
with the identity provider prior to this. During this stage, Hash based
Encryption algorithm is used to provide secure communication between the
identity provider and the user. In this paper we suggest that higher security
can be given to user login by using an additional cryptographic technique, i.e.
Hash based Encryption algorithm with the help of the Key Exchange Protocol.
