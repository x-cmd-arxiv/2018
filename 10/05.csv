Pritchett","ASIED: A Bayesian Adaptive Subgroup-Identification Enrichment Design",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developing targeted therapies based on patients' baseline characteristics and
genomic profiles such as biomarkers has gained growing interests in recent
years. Depending on patients' clinical characteristics, the expression of
specific biomarkers or their combinations, different patient subgroups could
respond differently to the same treatment. An ideal design, especially at the
proof of concept stage, should search for such subgroups and make dynamic
adaptation as the trial goes on. When no prior knowledge is available on
whether the treatment works on the all-comer population or only works on the
subgroup defined by one biomarker or several biomarkers, it is necessary to
incorporate the adaptive estimation of the heterogeneous treatment effect to
the decision-making at interim analyses. To address this problem, we propose an
Adaptive Subgroup-Identification Enrichment Design, ASIED, to simultaneously
search for predictive biomarkers, identify the subgroups with differential
treatment effects, and modify study entry criteria at interim analyses when
justified. More importantly, we construct robust quantitative decision-making
rules for population enrichment when the interim outcomes are heterogeneous in
the context of a multilevel target product profile, which defines the minimal
and targeted levels of treatment effect. Through extensive simulations, the
ASIED is demonstrated to achieve desirable operating characteristics and
compare favorably against alternatives.

The strong local correlations are treated non-perturbatively by the DMFT, while
the fRG flow can be formulated such that it is driven exclusively by non-local
correlations, which are more amenable to approximations. We show that the full
frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex needs to be taken into account

the singular frequency dependence of the vertex at strong coupling. We are thus

fitting to experimental data is fundamental for many problems in biomechanics.
Models of shear-thinning complex fluids, dating from the work of Bird, Carreau,
Cross and Yasuda, have been applied in highly-cited computational studies of
heamodynamics for several decades. In this manuscript we revisit these models,
first to highlight a degree of uncertainty in the naming conventions in the
literature, but more importantly to address the problem of inferring model
parameters by fitting rheology experiments. By refitting published data, and
also by simulation, we find large, flat regions in likelihood surfaces that
yield families of parameter sets which fit the data equally well. Despite
having almost indistinguishable fits to experimental data these varying
parameter sets can predict very different flow profiles, and as such these
parameters cannot be used to draw conclusions about physical properties of the
fluids, such as zero-shear viscosity or relaxation time of the fluid, or indeed
flow behaviours. We verify that these features are not a consequence of the
experimental data sets through simulations; by sampling points from the
rheological models and adding a small amount of noise we create a synthetic
data set which reveals that the problem of parameter identifiability is
intrinsic to these models.

similar magnetotransport phenomena observed in other rare-earth intermetallics
have often been attributed to the interaction of itinerant carriers with
localized magnetic moments stemming from the $4f$-shell of the rare-earth

minimizing a (nonconvex) quadratic form over the unit simplex. We focus on
reformulating a standard quadratic program as a mixed integer linear
programming problem. We propose two alternative mixed integer linear
programming formulations. Our first formulation is based on casting a standard
quadratic program as a linear program with complementarity constraints. We then
employ binary variables to linearize the complementarity constraints. For the
second formulation, we first derive an overestimating function of the objective
function and establish its tightness at any global minimizer. We then linearize
the overestimating function using binary variables and obtain our second
formulation. For both formulations, we propose a set of valid inequalities. Our
extensive computational results illustrate that the proposed mixed integer
linear programming reformulations significantly outperform other global
solution approaches. On larger instances, we usually observe improvements of
orders of magnitude.

with naturally cleaved graphite gates. Using spectroscopic imaging, we
characterize the local doping profile across and along the p-n junctions. We
find that realistic junctions exhibit non-ideality both in their geometry as
well as in the doping profile across the junction. We show that the geometry of
the junction can be improved by using the cleaved edge of van der Waals metals
such as graphite to define the junction. We quantify the geometric roughness
and doping profiles of junctions experimentally and use these parameters in
Nonequilibrium Green's Function based simulations of focusing and collimation
in these realistic junctions. We find that for realizing Veselago focusing, it
is crucial to minimize lateral interface roughness which only natural graphite
gates achieve, and to reduce junction width, in which both devices under
investigation underperform. We also find that carrier collimation is currently
limited by the non-linearity of the doping profile across the junction. Our

intra-channel baseline migration exists due to the non-zero width (resolution)

enhancing the expression of lineaments. We test the proposed framework on

manual photointerpretation and geologically mapped structures by the Geological
Survey of Western Australia (GSWA). The results show that the best correlation
between our extracted geological lineaments and the GSWA geological lineament
map is achieved by applying a minimum noise fraction transformation and a
Laplacian filter. Application of a directional filter instead shows a stronger
correlation with the output of our manual photointerpretation and known sites
of hydrothermal mineralization. Hence, our framework using either filter can be
used for mineral prospectivity mapping in other regions where faults are
exposed and observable in optical remote sensing data.

development of the multiscale finite volume (MSFV) framework, and has received
considerable attention in recent years. Each time step for SFI consists of an
outer loop to solve the coupled system, in which there is one inner Newton loop
to implicitly solve the pressure equation and another loop to implicitly solve
the transport equations. Limited research has been conducted that deals with
the outer coupling level to investigate the convergence performance. In this
paper we extend the basic SFI method with several nonlinear acceleration
techniques for improving the outer-loop convergence. Specifically, we consider
numerical relaxation, quasi-Newton (QN) and Anderson acceleration (AA) methods.
The acceleration techniques are adapted and studied for the first time within
the context of SFI for coupled flow and transport in porous media. We reveal
that the iterative form of SFI is equivalent to a nonlinear block Gauss-Seidel
(BGS) process. The effectiveness of the acceleration techniques is demonstrated
using several challenging examples. The results show that the basic SFI method
is quite inefficient, suffering from slow convergence or even convergence
failure. In order to better understand the behaviors of SFI, we carry out
detailed analysis on the coupling mechanisms between the sub-problems. Compared
with the basic SFI method, superior convergence performance is achieved by the
acceleration techniques, which can resolve the convergence difficulties
associated with various types of coupling effects. We show across a wide range
of flow conditions that the acceleration techniques can stabilize the iterative
process, and largely reduce the outer iteration count.

is based on a family of sparse generalized doubles (D) operators which provides
an affordable and systematically improvable unitary coupled-cluster
wavefunction suitable for implementation on a near-term quantum computer.
$k$-UpCCGSD employs $k$ products of the exponential of pair coupled-cluster
double excitation operators (pCCD), together with generalized single (S)
excitation operators. We compare its performance in both efficiency of
implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing
the full generalized SD excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the
standard ansatz employing only SD excitations (UCCSD). $k$-UpCCGSD is found to
show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit
depth of $\mathcal O(kN)$, compared with $\mathcal O(N^3)$ for UCCGSD and
$\mathcal O((N-\eta)^2 \eta)$ for UCCSD where $N$ is the number of spin
orbitals and $\eta$ is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of
these three ans\""atze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground
state and the first excited state of H$_4$ (STO-3G, 6-31G), H$_2$O (STO-3G),
and N$_2$ (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled
cluster methods. The results for ground states show that $k$-UpCCGSD offers a
good tradeoff between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower
cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. Excited
states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum
eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies
than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a
specialized multi-determinantal reference state constructed from classical
linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be
improved.

Because every topological crystalline insulator can be deformed into a

provided by a class of simple quantum theories of a bosonic field inhabiting a
d-dimensional space and experiencing a momentum dependent attractive
interaction. An exact mode counting reveals a family of holographic states. In
each a set of gapless modes emerges with their number equal to the area of a
(d-1)-dimensional sphere. These modes store an exponentially large number of
patterns within a microscopic energy gap. The resulting micro-state entropy
obeys the area-law reminiscent of a black hole entropy. We study the
time-evolution of the stored patterns and observe the following phenomenon:
Among the degenerate micro-states the ones with heavier loaded memories survive
longer than those that store emptier patterns. Thus, a state gets stabilized by
the burden of its own memory. From time to time the information pattern gets
off-loaded from one holographic state into another but cannot escape the
system. During this process the pattern becomes highly entangled and scrambled.
We suggest that this phenomenon is universal in systems with enhanced memory
storage capacity, such as black holes or critical neural networks. This
universality sheds an interesting light on the puzzle of why, despite the
evaporation, is a black hole forced to maintain information internally for a
very long time.

entanglement spectra, we show that they are symmetry protected topological
phases. In sharp contrast to the non-interacting limit, these topological
density waves do not follow the bulk-edge correspondence, as their edge modes
are gapped. We then discuss how these results are immediately applicable to
models in the AIII class, and to crystalline topological insulators protected

function $\Psi(\Lambda) = \exp(i\mathbb S(\Lambda))$ along complex contours
bounded by essential singularities of $\Psi$. There is a one to one map between
steepest descent paths connecting essential singularities and real or complex
eigenrays. Residues of finite $\Lambda$ poles of $\mathbb S(\Lambda)$ are shown
to vanish at spatial points corresponding to sources, provided that the pole
bounds only one steepest descent path. If the sum includes two such paths, with
one beginning and the other ending at the same pole, points of vanishing
residue are not sources, but are argued to be the locus on which caustic curves
may have singularities such as cusp points. The map between $\mathbb S$ and the
generating function in the Thom--Arnold classification of catastrophes is
discussed. Monodromies of the solution set with respect to complexified
parameters defining the index of refraction, or spatial endpoints of Green's
functions, are trivially determined from the singularities of $\mathbb

measure the B-mode signature of a range of different simulated systematics

additive shear bias and photometric redshift selection bias. We show that any
correlation between photometric-noise and the relative orientation of the

potential, which couples pairs of domain walls (kinks) into bound
quasiparticles, analogous to mesonic bound states in high-energy physics. We
show that these quasiparticles have signatures in the dynamics of order
parameters following a global quench and the Fourier spectrum of these order
parameters can be expolited as a direct probe of the masses of the confined
quasiparticles. We introduce a two-kink model to qualitatively explain the
phenomenon of long-range-interaction induced confinement, and to quantitatively
predict the masses of the bound quasiparticles. Furthermore, we illustrate that
these quasiparticle states can lead to slow thermalization of one-point
observables for certain initial states. Our work is readily applicable to
current trapped-ion experiments.

Circumstellar disks also undergo viscous evolution which leads to disk
expansion. Previous work indicates that dynamical truncation and viscous
evolution play a major role in determining circumstellar disk size and mass
distributions. However, it remains unclear under what circumstances each of
these two processes dominates. Here we present results of simulations of young
stellar clusters taking viscous evolution and dynamical truncations into
account. We model the embedded phase of the clusters by adding leftover gas as
a background potential which can be present through the whole evolution of the
cluster, or expelled after 1 Myr. We compare our simulation results to actual
observations of disk sizes, disk masses, and accretion rates in star forming
regions. We argue that the relative importance of dynamical truncations and the
viscous evolution of the disks changes with time and cluster density. Viscous
evolution causes the importance of dynamical encounters to increase in time,
but the encounters cease soon after the expulsion of the leftover gas. For the
clusters simulated in this work, viscous growth dominates the evolution of the
disks.

drift of pebbles in protoplanetary disks. The Lagrangian nature of the model
makes it especially suited to follow characteristics of individual (groups of)

content of solid particles. Planetesimal formation via streaming instability is
taken into account, partly based on previous results on streaming instability
outside the water snowline that were presented in Schoonenberg & Ormel (2017).
We validate our model by reproducing earlier results from the literature and
apply our model to steady-state viscous gas disks (with constant gas accretion
rate) around stars with different masses. We also present various other models
where we explore the effects of pebble accretion, the fragmentation velocity
threshold, the global metallicity of the disk, and a time-dependent gas
accretion rate. We find that planetesimals preferentially form in a local
annulus outside the water snowline, at early times in the lifetime of the disk
($\lesssim$$10^{5} \: \rm{yr}$), when the pebble mass fluxes are high enough to
trigger the streaming instability. During this first phase in the planet
formation process, the snowline location hardly changes due to slow viscous
evolution, and we conclude that assuming a constant gas accretion rate is
justified in this first stage. The efficiency of converting the solids
reservoir of the disk to planetesimals depends on the location of the water
snowline. Cooler disks with a closer-in water snowline are more efficient at
producing planetesimals than hotter disks where the water snowline is located
further away from the star. Therefore, low-mass stars tend to form
planetesimals more efficiently, but any correlation may be overshadowed by the
spread in disk properties.

a 3D magnetic topological insulator (TI). The most familiar AXI results from
magnetically gapping the surface states of a 3D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ TI while
preserving the bulk gap. Like the 3D TI, it exhibits a quantized
magnetoelectric polarizability of $\theta=\pi$, and can be diagnosed from bulk
symmetry eigenvalues when inversion symmetric. However, whereas a 3D TI is
characterized by bulk Wilson loop winding, 2D surface states, and the pumping
of the 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ TI index, we show that an AXI with a large number of
bulk bands displays no Wilson loop winding, exhibits chiral hinge states, and
does not pump any previously identified quantity. Crucially, as the AXI
exhibits the topological angle $\theta=\pi$, its occupied bands cannot be
formed into maximally localized symmetric Wannier functions, despite its
absence of Wilson loop winding. In this letter, we revisit the AXI from the
perspective of the recently introduced notion of ""fragile"" topology, and
discover that it in fact can be generically expressed as the cyclic pumping of
a ""trivialized"" fragile phase: a 2D inversion-symmetric insulator with no
Wilson loop winding which nevertheless carries a nontrivial topological index,
the nested Berry phase $\gamma_{2}$. We numerically show that the nontrivial
value $\gamma_{2}=\pi$ indicates the presence of anomalous 0D corner charges in
a 2D insulator, and therefore, that the chiral pumping of $\gamma_{2}$ in a 3D
AXI corresponds to the presence of chiral hinge states. We also briefly
generalize our results to time-reversal-symmetric higher-order TIs, and discuss
the related appearance of nontrivial $\gamma_{2}$ protected by
$C_{2}\times\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in twisted bilayer graphene, and its

halos. In its simplest form, halo bias is determined by halo mass, but there
are known additional dependencies on other halo properties which are of
consequence for accurate modeling of galaxy clustering. Here we present the
most precise measurement of these secondary-bias dependencies on halo age,
concentration, and spin, for a wide range of halo masses spanning from
10$^{10.7}$ to 10$^{14.7}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. At the high-mass end, we find
no strong evidence of assembly bias for masses above M$_{vir}$ $\sim10^{14}$
$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. Secondary bias exists, however, for halo concentration
and spin, up to cluster-size halos, in agreement with previous findings. For
halo spin, we report, for the first time, two different regimes: above
M$_{vir}\sim$10$^{11.5}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$, halos with larger values of spin
have larger bias, at fixed mass, with the effect reaching almost a factor 2.
This trend reverses below this characteristic mass. In addition to these
results, we test, for the first time, the performance of a multi-tracer method
for the determination of the relative bias between different subsets of halos.
We show that this method increases significantly the signal-to-noise of the
secondary-bias measurement as compared to a traditional approach. This analysis

our results to a general greedy local parameter estimation scenario. In

for local metrology plays a role in sensitivity enhancement in the

inside galaxy clusters are characterised by more radially dominated orbits,
independent of cluster mass. Furthermore, the vast majority of star-forming
satellite galaxies stop forming stars during their first passage. We find a
strong dichotomy both in line-of-sight and radial phase space between
star-forming and quiescent galaxies, in line with observations. The tracking of
individual orbits shows that the star-formation of almost all satellite
galaxies drops to zero within $1 \, \mathrm{Gyr}$ after in-fall. Satellite
galaxies that are able to remain star-forming longer are characterised by
tangential orbits and high stellar mass. All this indicates that in galaxy
clusters the dominant quenching mechanism is ram-pressure stripping.

metallicity and distance for the parental cluster. From the RRab stars we find

We confirm the amplitude modulations of the Blazhko type of five RRab and the
non-membership of V21 to the cluster. The colour-magnitude diagram is

well segregated around the first overtone red edge of the instability strip.

ability of model selection methods to discriminate among various ecological
hypotheses. The last decade has seen the rise of Bayesian hierarchical models
in ecology. Consequently, popular tools, such as the AIC, become largely
inapplicable and other tools are not universally applicable. We focus on a
class of competing Bayesian spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) models
and first apply some of the recommended Bayesian model selection tools: (1)
Bayes Factor - using (a) Gelfand-Dey (b) harmonic mean methods, (2) DIC, (3)
WAIC and (4) the posterior predictive loss function. In all, we evaluate 25
variants of model selection tools in our study. We evaluate these model
selection tools from the standpoint of model selection and parameter estimation
by contrasting the choice recommended by a tool with a `true' model. In all, we
generate 120 simulated data sets using the true model and assess the frequency
with which the true model is selected and how well the tool estimates N
(population size). We find that when information content is low, no particular
tool can be recommended to help realise, simultaneously, both the goals of
model selection and parameter estimation. In such scenarios, we recommend that
practitioners utilise our application of Bayes Factor for parameter estimation
and recommend the posterior predictive loss approach for model selection when
information content is low. When both the objectives are taken together, we
recommend the use of our applications of Bayes Factor for Bayesian SECR models.
Our study reveals that although new model selection tools are emerging (eg:
WAIC) in the applied statistics literature, an uncritical absorption of these
new tools (i.e. without assessing their efficacies for the problem at hand)
into ecological practice may mislead inferences.

control of superconducting qubits, magnonic resonators, and phase noise
filters, would be well served by having a highly tunable microwave resonance.
Often this tunability is desired in situ at low temperatures, where one can
take advantage of superconducting cavities. To date, such cryogenic tuning
while maintaining a high quality factor has been limited to $\sim500$ MHz. Here
we demonstrate a three-dimensional superconducting microwave cavity that shares
one wall with a pressurized volume of helium. Upon pressurization of the helium
chamber the microwave cavity is deformed, which results in in situ tuning of
its resonant frequency by more than 5 GHz, greater than 60% of the original 8
GHz resonant frequency. The quality factor of the cavity remains approximately
constant at $\approx7\times 10^{3}$ over the entire range of tuning. As a
demonstration of its usefulness, we implement a tunable cryogenic phase noise
filter, which reduces the phase noise of our source by approximately 10 dB
above 400 kHz.

lattice satisfying divisibility and the double negation law. In our previous

modification of an MV-algebra. The natural question arises if an NMV-algebra
can be converted into a residuated structure, too. Contrary to MV-algebras,
NMV-algebras are not based on lattices but only on directed posets and the
binary operation need not be associative and hence we cannot expect to obtain a
residuated lattice but only an essentially weaker structure called a
conditionally residuated poset. Considering several additional natural
conditions we show that every NMV-algebra can be converted in such a structure.
Also conversely, every such structure can be organized into an NMV-algebra.
Further, we study a bit more stronger version of an algebra where the binary
operation is even monotonous. We show that such an algebra can be organized
into a residuated poset and, conversely, every residuated poset can be

in many cases one can benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage
approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that predicts well, and
then find a minimal subset of features that characterize the predictions. The
model built in the first step is referred to as the \emph{reference model} and
the operation during the latter step as predictive \emph{projection}. The key
characteristic of this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between
sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from utilizing all
available information including prior and that coming from the left out
features. We review several methods that follow this principle and provide
novel methodological contributions. We present a new projection technique that
unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and fast to compute. We
also propose a way of evaluating the feature selection process using fast
leave-one-out cross-validation that allows for easy and intuitive model size
selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem that helps to understand the
conditions under which the projective approach could be beneficial. The
benefits are illustrated via several simulated and real world examples.

of Langevin equations has a solutions that, sampled in discrete time, are the
moving average autoregressive processes, which can be analysed using large

A novel method which is based on the state space modeling has been proposed to
track the bird, where the VHF transmitter is attached to the bird to emit the
signal and several towers with antenna arrays installed on its top are built to
receive the signal. The method consists of two parts, the first one is called
movement model which accounts for prediction of the dynamic movement of the
target, and the second part is the measurement model which links the target's
state variables to the available measurements data, the measurement includes
the time when the signal was detected, the ID of the antenna array which
detected the signal and integers between 0 and 255, the integers are
proportional to the strength of received signal. The extended Kalman filter is
then applied to estimate the location of the target with combing the movement
model and measurement model. In the movement model, several parameters with
positive values are deployed to define the change of the state variables with
time, these parameters reflect the relationship of the state variables at
current time and next time. In this paper, a method based on the maximum
likelihood estimation is proposed to estimate the appropriate values for these
unknown constant variables with given measurement data, and a kite is applied
to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. Furthermore, the unscented
transformation is applied in Kalman filter to achieve more accurate estimation

difficult task, since the temporal dimension of videos introduces an extra
challenge during the generation process. Besides, due to the limitation of
memory and training stability, the generation becomes increasingly challenging
with the increase of the resolution/duration of videos. In this work, we
exploit the idea of progressive growing of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for higher resolution video generation. In particular, we begin to
produce video samples of low-resolution and short-duration, and then
progressively increase both resolution and duration alone (or jointly) by
adding new spatiotemporal convolutional layers to the current networks.
Starting from the learning on a very raw-level spatial appearance and temporal
movement of the video distribution, the proposed progressive method learns
spatiotemporal information incrementally to generate higher resolution videos.
Furthermore, we introduce a sliced version of Wasserstein GAN (SWGAN) loss to
improve the distribution learning on the video data of high-dimension and
mixed-spatiotemporal distribution. SWGAN loss replaces the distance between
joint distributions by that of one-dimensional marginal distributions, making
the loss easier to compute. We evaluate the proposed model on our collected
face video dataset of 10,900 videos to generate photorealistic face videos of

self-organization in experiments on cold atoms with long-range optically

capture the universal effects of long-range interactions and yet be exactly
solvable in the canonical ensemble. In this work we consider the quantum

is both nonlinear and nonlocal. The exact solutions are Mathieu functions that
obey a nonlinear relation between the wavefunction and the depth of the
meanfield potential, and we identify them as bright solitons. Using a Galilean
transformation these solutions can be boosted to finite velocity and are
increasingly localized as the meanfield potential becomes deeper. In contrast
to the usual local GPE, the HMF case features a tower of solitons, each with a
different number of nodes. Our results suggest that long-range interactions
support solitary waves in a novel manner relative to the short-range case.

end-to-end learning policies for single tasks and attempting to transfer them,
we first use simulation to simultaneously learn (1) a continuous

primitive skills, and (2) a single policy for these skills which is conditioned
on this representation. We then directly transfer our multi-skill policy to a

actuate the policy, with each latent corresponding to a pre-learned primitive
skill controller. We complete unseen tasks by choosing new sequences of skill

Bayesian method against simulated galaxies created in the McMaster Unbiased
Galaxy Simulations 2 (MUGS2), for which the true mass is known. We estimate the

masses that were not recovered within the 95\% c.r., a large subset have
posterior distributions that occupy extreme ends of the parameter space allowed
by the priors. A few incorrect mass estimates are explained by the exceptional
evolution history of the galaxies. We also find evidence that the model cannot
describe both the galaxies' inner and outer structure simultaneously in some
cases. After removing the GC analogs associated with the galactic disks, the
true masses were found more reliably (13 out of 18 were predicted within the

set of methods for constrained smooth convex minimization due to their
simplicity, the absence of projection steps, and competitive numerical
performance. While the vanilla Frank-Wolfe algorithm only ensures a worst-case
rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$, various recent results have shown that for
strongly convex functions on polytopes, the method can be slightly modified to
achieve linear convergence. However, this still leaves a huge gap between
sublinear $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ convergence and linear $\mathcal{O}(\log

present a new variant of Conditional Gradient algorithms, that can dynamically
adapt to the function's geometric properties using restarts and smoothly
interpolates between the sublinear and linear regimes. These interpolated

visible in all passbands of SDO/AIA and in the white-light continuum of
SDO/HMI. We investigate its electron density by taking into account all
radiation processes in the flare loops, i.e. the Thomson continuum, hydrogen
Paschen and Brackett recombination continua, as well as free-free continuum
emission. We derive a quadratic function of the electron density for a given
temperature and effective loop thickness. By absolutely calibrating SDO/HMI
intensities, we convert the measured intensities into electron density at each
pixel in the loops. For a grid of plausible temperatures between cool (6000 K)
and hot (10^6 K) structures, the electron density is computed for
representative effective thicknesses between 200 and 20 000 km. We obtain a
relatively high maximum electron density, about 10^13 cm^-3. At such high
electron densities, the Thomson continuum is negligible and therefore one would
not expect a significant polarization degree in dense loops. We conclude that
the Paschen and Brackett recombination continua are dominant in cool flare

physical phenomenon. A maximum SPhP redshift of 19 cm-1 is predicted for a
200-nm-diameter hemispherical probing tip and a vacuum gap of 10 nm. Resonance
redshift is mediated by electromagnetic gap modes excited in the vacuum gap
separating the probe and the surface when the probing tip is much larger than
the gap size. The impact of gap modes on the scattered field can be mitigated
with a probing tip size approximately equal to or smaller than the vacuum gap.
However, sharp probing tips induce important spectral broadening of the
scattered field. It is also demonstrated that a dipole approximation with
multiple reflections cannot be used for explaining the physics and predicting
the amount of redshift in near-field thermal spectroscopy. This work shows that
the scattered field in the far zone is a combination of the thermal near field

Compared to inclusive DIS, information about the quantum numbers of the struck

final state hadrons. Up to now, virtually all knowledge about the quark-gluon
structure of the nucleon from SIDIS has been gained from distributions of

from four source galaxy redshift bins, we reject the hypothesis of no lensing
with a significance of $10.8\sigma$. When employing angular scale cuts, this

signal-to-noise measurement of its kind to date. We fit the amplitude of the
correlation functions while fixing the cosmological parameters to a fiducial
$\Lambda$CDM model, finding $A = 0.99 \pm 0.17$. We additionally use the
correlation function measurements to constrain shear calibration bias,
obtaining constraints that are consistent with previous DES analyses. Finally,
when performing a cosmological analysis under the $\Lambda$CDM model, we obtain
the marginalized constraints of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.261^{+0.070}_{-0.051}$ and
$S_{8}\equiv \sigma_{8}\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.660^{+0.085}_{-0.100}$.

different task objectives with respect to different sets of parameters.
Appropriately scheduling the optimization of a task objective or a set of

present AutoLoss, a meta-learning framework that automatically learns and
determines the optimization schedule. AutoLoss provides a generic way to
represent and learn the discrete optimization schedule from metadata, allows
for a dynamic and data-driven schedule in ML problems that involve alternating
updates of different parameters or from different loss objectives. We apply
AutoLoss on four ML tasks: d-ary quadratic regression, classification using a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP), image generation using GANs, and multi-task
neural machine translation (NMT). We show that the AutoLoss controller is able
to capture the distribution of better optimization schedules that result in
higher quality of convergence on all four tasks. The trained AutoLoss
controller is generalizable -- it can guide and improve the learning of a new
task model with different specifications, or on different datasets.

Recommending sets, each of which is composed of multiple interacted items, is

adopt a multi-layer fully-connected network structure. We design and compare
three alternative architectures for FashionNet. To achieve personalized

fine-tuning technique to transfer a general compatibility model to a model that
embeds personal preference. Experiments on a large scale data set collected

the greatest possible percentage of the final wealth of the best pairs

maintain a target fraction of wealth in each of the two. After each discrete
market fluctuation, a pairs rebalancing rule will sell a precise amount of the
outperforming stock and put the proceeds into the underperforming stock. Under
typical conditions, in hindsight one can find pairs rebalancing rules that
would have spectacularly beaten the market. Our trading strategy, which extends
Ordentlich and Cover's (1998) ""max-min universal portfolio,"" guarantees to
achieve an acceptable percentage of the hindsight-optimized wealth, a
percentage which tends to zero at a slow (polynomial) rate. This means that on
a long enough investment horizon, the trader can enforce a compound-annual
growth rate that is arbitrarily close to that of the best pairs rebalancing
rule in hindsight. The strategy will ""beat the market asymptotically"" if there
turns out to exist a pairs rebalancing rule that grows capital at a higher
asymptotic rate than the market index. The advantages of our algorithm over the
Ordentlich and Cover (1998) strategy are twofold. First, their strategy is
impossible to compute in practice. Second, in considering the more modest

reduce the ""cost of universality"" and achieve a higher learning rate.

content-type distribution networks. In the PICOD$(t)$ problem there are $m$
messages, $n$ users and each user has a distinct message side information set,
as in the classical Index Coding problem (IC). Differently from IC, where each
user has a pre-specified set of messages to decode, in the PICOD$(t)$ a user is
""pliable"" and is satisfied if it can decode any $t$ messages that are not in
its side information set. The goal is to find a code with the shortest length
that satisfies all the users. This flexibility in determining the desired
message sets makes the PICOD$(t)$ behave quite differently compared to the IC,
and its analysis challenging.
  This paper mainly focuses on the \emph{complete--$S$} PICOD$(t)$ with $m$
messages, where the set $S\subset[m]$ contains the sizes of the side
information sets, and the number of users is $n=\sum_{s\in S}\binom{m}{s}$,
with no two users having the same side information set. Capacity results are
shown for: (i) the \emph{consecutive} complete--$S$ PICOD$(t)$, where
$S=[s_{\min}:s_{\max}]$ for some $0 \leq s_{\min} \leq s_{\max} \leq m-t$, and
(ii) the \emph{complement-consecutive} complete--$S$ PICOD$(t)$, where
$S=[0:m-t]\backslash[s_{\min}:s_{\max}]$, for some $0 < s_{\min} \leq s_{\max}
< m-t$. The novel converse proof is inspired by combinatorial design techniques
and the key insight is to consider all messages that a user can eventually
decode successfully, even those in excess of the $t$ required ones. This allows
one to circumvent the need to consider all possible desired message set
assignments at the users in order to find the one that leads to the shortest
code length.
  In addition, tight converse results are also shown for those PICOD$(1)$ with
circular-arc network topology hypergraph.

processing, e.g. for high-quality quad mesh generation. A common approach is to
prescribe the parametric domain structure, in particular the locations of
parametrization singularities (cones), and solve a non-convex optimization
problem minimizing a distortion measure, with local injectivity imposed through
either constraints or barrier terms. In both cases, an initial valid
parametrization is essential to serve as feasible starting point for obtaining
an optimized solution. While convexified versions of the constraints eliminate
this initialization requirement, they narrow the range of solutions, causing
some problem instances that actually do have a solution to become infeasible.
We demonstrate that for arbitrary given sets of topologically admissible
parametric cones with prescribed curvature, a global seamless parametrization
always exists (with the exception of one well-known case). Importantly, our
proof is constructive and directly leads to a general algorithm for computing
such parametrizations. Most distinctively, this algorithm is bootstrapped with
a convex optimization problem (solving for a conformal map), in tandem with a
simple linear equation system (determining a seamless modification of this
map). This initial map can then serve as valid starting point and be optimized

properties of gas and solid materials in cometary comae without mutual
contamination, but there have been few spectropolarimetric studies to extract
each component. We attempt to derive the continuum polarization degree of comet
2P/Encke, free from influence of molecular emissions. The target is unique in
that it has an orbit dynamically decoupled from Jupiter like main-belt
asteroids, while ejecting gas and dust like ordinary comets. We observed the
comet using the Higashi-Hiroshima Optical and Near-Infrared Camera attached to
the Cassegrain focus of the 150-cm Kanata telescope on UT 2017 February 21 when
the comet was at the solar phase angle of 75.7 deg. We find that the continuum
polarization degree with respect to the scattering plane is 33.8+/-2.7 % at the
effective wavelength of 0.815 um, which is significantly higher than those of
cometary dust in a high-Pmax group at similar phase angles. Assuming that an
ensemble polarimetric response of 2P/Encke's dust as a function of phase angle
is morphologically similar with those of other comets, its maximum polarization
degree is estimated to > 40 % at the phase angle of ~100 deg. In addition, we
obtain the polarization degrees of the C2 swan bands (0.51-0.56 um), the NH2
alpha bands (0.62-0.69 um) and the CN-red system (0.78-0.94 um) in a range of
3-19 %, which depend on the molecular species and rotational quantum numbers of
each branch. The polarization vector aligns nearly perpendicularly to the
scattering plane with the average of 0.4 deg over a wavelength range of
0.50-0.97 um. From the observational evidence, we conjecture that the large
polarization degree of 2P/Encke would be attributable to a dominance of large
dust particles around the nucleus, which have remained after frequent
perihelion passages near the Sun.

The standard convergence analyses of projection algorithms are based on the

projections onto the constraint sets are replaced by cutters (projections onto
separating hyperplanes), the firm nonexpansivity is lost. We provide a proof of
convergence for a family of related averaged relaxed cutter methods under
reasonable assumptions, relying on a simple geometric argument. This allows us
to clarify fine details related to the allowable choice of the relaxation

antiskyrmion motion with the combined action of the in-plane magnetic field and
microwave electric fields. The in-plane mag- netic field breaks the rotation
symmetry of the antiskyrmion, and perpendicular microwave electric field
induces the pumping of magnetic anisotropy, leading to antiskyrmion breathing
mode. With above two effects, the antiskyrmion propagates with a desired
trajectory. Antiskyrmion propagation velocity depends on the frequency,
amplitude of anisotropy pumping, and damping constant as well as strength of
in-plane field, which reaches the maximum value when the frequency of microwave
electric field is in consist with the resonance frequency of antiskyrmion.
Moreover, we show that the antiskyrmion propagation depends on the direction of
magnetic field, where the antiskyrmion Hall angle can be suppressed or
enhanced. At a critical direction of magnetic field, the Hall angle is zero.
Our results introduce a possible application of antiskyrmion in
antiskyrmion-based spintronic devices with lower energy consumption.

(1998) only priced this derivative at time-0, giving
$C_0=1+\sigma\sqrt{T/(2\pi)}$. Of course, the general time-$t$ price is not
equal to $1+\sigma\sqrt{(T-t)/(2\pi)}$. I complete the Ordentlich-Cover (1998)
analysis by deriving the price at any time $t$. By contrast, I also study the
more natural case of the best levered rebalancing rule in hindsight. This
yields $C(S,t)=\sqrt{T/t}\cdot\,\exp\{rt+\sigma^2b(S,t)^2\cdot t/2\}$, where
$b(S,t)$ is the best rebalancing rule in hindsight over the observed history
$[0,t]$. I show that the replicating strategy amounts to betting the fraction
$b(S,t)$ of wealth on the stock over the interval $[t,t+dt].$ This fact holds
for the general market with $n$ correlated stocks in geometric Brownian motion:
we get $C(S,t)=(T/t)^{n/2}\exp(rt+b'\Sigma b\cdot t/2)$, where $\Sigma$ is the
covariance of instantaneous returns per unit time. This result matches the
$\mathcal{O}(T^{n/2})$ ""cost of universality"" derived by Cover in his
""universal portfolio theory"" (1986, 1991, 1996, 1998), which super-replicates
the same derivative in discrete-time. The replicating strategy compounds its
money at the same asymptotic rate as the best levered rebalancing rule in
hindsight, thereby beating the market asymptotically. Naturally enough, we find
that the American-style version of Cover's Derivative is never exercised early
in equilibrium.

tomography (PET-CT) images for computer aided diagnosis applications requires
combining the sensitivity of PET to detect abnormal regions with anatomical
localization from CT. Current methods for PET-CT image analysis either process
the modalities separately or fuse information from each modality based on
knowledge about the image analysis task. These methods generally do not
consider the spatially varying visual characteristics that encode different
information across the different modalities, which have different priorities at
different locations. For example, a high abnormal PET uptake in the lungs is
more meaningful for tumor detection than physiological PET uptake in the heart.
Our aim is to improve fusion of the complementary information in multi-modality
PET-CT with a new supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to
fuse complementary information for multi-modality medical image analysis. Our
CNN first encodes modality-specific features and then uses them to derive a
spatially varying fusion map that quantifies the relative importance of each
modality's features across different spatial locations. These fusion maps are
then multiplied with the modality-specific feature maps to obtain a
representation of the complementary multi-modality information at different
locations, which can then be used for image analysis. We evaluated the ability
of our CNN to detect and segment multiple regions with different fusion
requirements using a dataset of PET-CT images of lung cancer. We compared our
method to baseline techniques for multi-modality image fusion and segmentation.
Our findings show that our CNN had a significantly higher foreground detection
accuracy (99.29%, p < 0.05) than the fusion baselines and a significantly
higher Dice score (63.85%) than recent PET-CT tumor segmentation methods.

Google and it was immediately welcomed by groups of users, such as the ones
described above, as Google Glass allows them to perform actions, like taking a

wearable devices can be used to authenticate users, both to grant access
(one-time) and to maintain access (continuous), in similar hands-free fashion.
We do so by designing and implementing Gauth, a system that enables users to
authenticate with a service simply by issuing a voice command, while facing the
computer terminal they are going to use to access the service. To achieve this
goal, we create a physical communication channel from the terminal to the
device using machine readable visual codes, like QR codes, and utilize the
device's network adapter to communicate directly with a service. More
importantly, we continuously authenticate the user accessing the terminal,
exploiting the fact that a user operating a terminal is most likely facing it
most of the time. We periodically issue authentication challenges, which are
displayed as a QR code on the terminal, that cause the glass device to
re-authenticate the user with an appropriate response. We evaluate our system

Here, by using the first-principles calculations, we predict that Germanium

concentration, which corresponds to the chemical formula C17Ge, the specific
capacity for Germagraphene can be as high as 1734 mAh/g, over four times larger
than graphite. We show that the material is conductive before and after Li

and find that the diffusion barrier is low (~0.151 eV), implying fast Li
diffusion. The calculated average intercalation potential is very low (~0.03
V), which is beneficial for increasing the working voltage for the full-cells.
In addition, during the process of Li intercalation, the lattice change for the

data. We consider four extensions of the minimal dark energy-dominated
scenarios: 1) nonzero curvature $\Omega_k$, 2) number of relativistic species
$N_{\rm eff}$ different from the standard value of 3.046, 3) time-varying
equation-of-state of dark energy described by the parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$
(alternatively quoted by the values at the pivot redshift, $w_p$, and $w_a$),
and 4) modified gravity described by the parameters $\mu_0$ and $\Sigma_0$ that
modify the metric potentials. We also consider external information from Planck
CMB measurements; BAO measurements from SDSS, 6dF, and BOSS; RSD measurements
from BOSS; and SNIa information from the Pantheon compilation. Constraints on
curvature and the number of relativistic species are dominated by the external
data; when these are combined with DES Y1, we find
$\Omega_k=0.0020^{+0.0037}_{-0.0032}$ at the 68% confidence level, and $N_{\rm
eff}<3.28\, (3.55)$ at 68% (95%) confidence. For the time-varying
equation-of-state, we find the pivot value $(w_p, w_a)=(-0.91^{+0.19}_{-0.23},
-0.57^{+0.93}_{-1.11})$ at pivot redshift $z_p=0.27$ from DES alone, and $(w_p,
w_a)=(-1.01^{+0.04}_{-0.04}, -0.28^{+0.37}_{-0.48})$ at $z_p=0.20$ from DES Y1
combined with external data; in either case we find no evidence for the
temporal variation of the equation of state. For modified gravity, we find the
present-day value of the relevant parameters to be $\Sigma_0=
0.43^{+0.28}_{-0.29}$ from DES Y1 alone, and $(\Sigma_0,
\mu_0)=(0.06^{+0.08}_{-0.07}, -0.11^{+0.42}_{-0.46})$ from DES Y1 combined with
external data, consistent with predictions from GR.

strong interaction between organic molecular excitons and photons within
microcavities. The spectral dispersion of third harmonic generation near
resonance with the cavity polariton states is studied experimentally via
angle-resolved reflected third harmonic generation measurements with several
pump wavelengths. In addition, a three-step nonlinear optical transfer matrix
model is used to simulate the third harmonic generation using the
sum-over-states dispersive nonlinear coefficients, which include hybrid
exciton-photon polariton states. The angle-dependent experiment and modeling
agree, revealing that the output of third harmonic generation is resonantly
enhanced when the third harmonic wavelength is near the upper polariton state.
The degree of enhancement is higher on the exciton-like branch of the polariton
dispersion. Lower polariton enhanced third harmonic generation is not
experimentally observed due to inadequate coupling at the longer wavelength,
which is also consistent with the nonlinear transfer matrix modeling. These
results indicate that the sum-over-states nonlinear dispersion is descriptive
of the process implying that the polariton states are terms in a complete set
of states forming the basis for the perturbative calculation of the nonlinear
optical response. The results also indicate the possibility of wavelength agile

films were grown simultaneously on (001) NdGaO3 (NGO) substrates by pulsed
laser deposition, and then post-growth annealed at 780 oC in O2 for different
durations of time. With increasing annealing time, the films developed
significant strains of opposite signs along the two orthogonal in-plane
directions. The static temperature-dependent resistivity, R(T), was measured
simultaneously along the two orthogonal directions. With increasing annealing
time, both zero-field-cooled and field-cooled R(T) show significant increases,
suggesting strain-triggered EPS and appearance of antiferromagnetic insulating
(AFI) phases in a ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) ground state. Meanwhile, R(T)
along the tensile-strained [010] direction becomes progressively larger than
that along the compressive-strained [100]. The enhanced resistivity anisotropy
indicates that the EPS is characterized by phase-separated FMM entities with a
preferred orientation along [100], possibly due to the cooperative deformation
and rotation/tilting of the MnO6 octahedra under the enhanced anisotropic
strain. The anisotropic EPS can also be tuned by an external magnetic field.
During a field-cycle at several fixed temperatures, the AFI phases are melted
at high fields and recovered at low fields, resulting in sharp resistance
changes of the ratio as high as 104. Furthermore, the resistivity was found to
exhibit glass-like behavior, relaxing logarithmically in the phase-separated
states. Fitting the data to a phenomenological model, the resulting resistive
viscosity and characteristic relaxation time are found to evolve with
temperature, showing a close correlation with the static measurements in the

complex nature of human choices, escaping traditional behavioral assumptions

models of intransitive comparisons have been proposed, but in all cases the
maximum likelihood problem is non-concave, making inference difficult. In this
work we generalize this trend, showing that there cannot exist any parametric
model with a concave log-likelihood function that can exhibit intransitive
preferences. Given this result, we motivate a new model for analyzing
intransitivity in pairwise comparisons, taking inspiration from the Condorcet
method (majority vote) in social choice theory. The Majority Vote model we
analyze is defined as a voting process over independent Random Utility Models
(RUMs). We infer a multidimensional embedding of each object or player, in
contrast to the traditional one-dimensional embedding used by models such as
the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) models. We show that a
three-dimensional majority vote model is capable of modeling arbitrarily strong

comparison probabilities on any triplet. We provide experimental results that
substantiate our claims regarding the effectiveness of our model in capturing

quartic coupling on the Yukawa coupling constants, we find that the addition of
order one Yukawa couplings beyond the top quark drastically lowers the scale at
which the Higgs potential becomes unstable. Specifically, even with only one
additional order one Yukawa coupling, the scalar potential becomes unstable
already at the TeV scale, assuming the Standard Model values for the Higgs
sector parameters at the electroweak scale. Furthermore, by assuming the
Standard Model values for the Higgs sector parameters at the TeV scale, the
quartic coupling constant is driven to be larger than its Standard Model value
at the electroweak scale. This in turn predicts a much lighter Higgs mass than
the measured value of 125 GeV. In this scenario, the strength of the
electroweak phase transition is also significantly weakened.

that performance can degrade in some settings - such as with stochasticity or
implicit momentum. In deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), such optimization
methods are often used for training neural networks via the temporal difference
error or policy gradient. As an agent improves over time, the optimization
target changes and thus the loss landscape (and local optima) change. Due to
the failure modes of those methods, the ideal choice of optimizer for Deep RL
remains unclear. As such, we provide an empirical analysis of the effects that
a wide range of gradient descent optimizers and their hyperparameters have on
policy gradient methods, a subset of Deep RL algorithms, for benchmark
continuous control tasks. We find that adaptive optimizers have a narrow window
of effective learning rates, diverging in other cases, and that the
effectiveness of momentum varies depending on the properties of the
environment. Our analysis suggests that there is significant interplay between
the dynamics of the environment and Deep RL algorithm properties which aren't
necessarily accounted for by traditional adaptive gradient methods. We provide
suggestions for optimal settings of current methods and further lines of
research based on our findings.

finite length $R$-module with free resolution $G_\bullet$. De Stefani, Huneke,
and N\'{u}\~{n}ez-Betancourt explored two questions about the properties of
resolutions of $M$. First, in characteristic $p>0$, what vanishing conditions
on the Frobenius Betti numbers, $\beta_i^F(M, R) : = \lim_{e \to \infty}
\lambda(H_i(F^e(G_\bullet)))/p^{ed}$, force pd$_R M < \infty$. Second, if pd$_R
M = \infty $, does this force $d+2$nd or higher syzygies of $M$ to have
infinite length.
  For the first question, they showed, under rather restrictive hypotheses,
that $d+1$ consecutive vanishing Frobenius Betti numbers forces pd$_R M <
\infty$. And when $d=1$ and $R$ is CM then one vanishing Frobenius Betti number
suffices. Using properties of stably phantom homology, we show that these
results hold in general, i.e., $d+1$ consecutive vanishing Frobenius Betti
numbers force pd$_R M < \infty$, and, under the hypothesis that $R$ is CM, $d$
consecutive vanishing Frobenius Betti numbers suffice.
  For the second question, they obtain very interesting results when $d=1$. In
particular, no third syzygy of $M$ can have finite length. Their main tool is,
if $d=1$, to show, if the syzygy has a finite length, then it is an alternating
sum of lengths of Tors. We are able to prove this fact for rings of arbitrary
dimension, which allows us to show that if $d=2$, no third syzygy of $M$ can be
finite length! We also are able to show that the question has a positive answer
if the dimension of the socle of $H^0_{\mathfrak m}(R)$ is large relative to
the rest of the module, generalizing the case of Buchsbaum rings.

pollution in the cities of the world. Urban traffic engineers and managers have

approach, through software applications or information boards, network managers
are informed about the users' status in the network and offer the best route to
them. Finally, the third approach involves optimizing the capacity of the UTN.
This approach tries to control the traffic actuators in order to create the
maximum capacity for network users. Therefore, it can be said that the advanced
traffic management systems (ATMS) are based on four main sections. These four
sections include traffic information, traffic assignment, traffic optimization,
and traffic prediction. This paper initially presents an overview of these four
sections, in the end, it proposes a development strategy for the ATMSs.

algorithm over wireless sensor networks based on randomized consensus strategy.
Compared with the centralized algorithm, distributed filtering techniques
require less computation per sensor and lead to more robust estimation since
they simply use the information from the neighboring nodes in the network.
However, poor local sensor estimation caused by limited observability and
network topology changes which interfere the global consensus are challenging
issues. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel randomized
gossip-based distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. Information exchange and
computation in the proposed algorithm can be carried out in an arbitrarily
connected network of nodes. In addition, the computational burden can be
distributed for a sensor which communicates with a stochastically selected
neighbor at each clock step under schemes of gossip algorithm. In this case,
the error covariance matrix changes stochastically at every clock step, thus
the convergence is considered in a probabilistic sense. We provide the mean
square convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. Under a sufficient
condition, we show that the proposed algorithm is quite appealing as it
achieves better mean square error performance theoretically than the
noncooperative decentralized Kalman filtering algorithm. Besides, considering
the limited computation, communication, and energy resources in the wireless
sensor networks, we propose an optimization problem which minimizes the average
expected state estimation error based on the proposed algorithm. To solve the
proposed problem efficiently, we transform it into a convex optimization
problem. And a sub-optimal solution is attained. Examples and simulations are
provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

OFDM-IM signal passes through high power amplifier (HPA). In this letter,
dither signals are added in the idle subcarriers to reduce the PAPR. Unlike the
previous work using single level dither signals, multilevel dither signals are
used by exploiting that the amplitudes of the active subcarriers are variously

dither signals more freedom (a larger radius of dithering) in average.

traffic, there may be unoccupied channels in the EUPs of the cells. These
unoccupied channels of the EUPs can assist the excessive number of users if
these channels are assigned with proper interference management. If the number
of traffic of a cell surpasses the number of channels of the EUP, then the cell
assigns the channels from the EUP of other cells in the cluster. To alleviate

sectors the EUP of the cell which assigns channels that the assigned channels
are provided to the sectored part where these channels receive negligible

provisioning of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a challenge in the wireless

effective way to provide the excessive users with desirable QoS. Since QoS for
non-real-time traffic are not as strict as for real-time traffic, the
unoccupied channels of the adjacent cells can be assigned to the non-real-time
traffic to retain QoS for real-time traffic. This results in the intensified

In this paper, we propose an effective radio resource management scheme that
relies on the dynamically assigned bandwidth allocation process. In case of
interference management, we classify the traffic into real-time traffic and
non-real-time traffic and give priority to the real-time traffic. According to
our scheme, the real-time traffic among the excessive number of users are
reassigned to the original channels which have been occupied by non-real-time

resource jams a wireless network through which the packet from a sensor is sent
to a remote estimator to estimate the system state. To degrade the estimation
quality with power constraint, the attacker aims to solve how much power to
obstruct the channel each time, which is the recently proposed optimal attack
energy management problem. The existing works are built on an ideal link model
in which the packet dropout never occurs without attack. To encompass wireless
transmission losses, we introduce the SINR-based link. First, we focus on the
case when the attacker employs the constant power level. To maximize the
terminal error at the remote estimator, we provide some sufficient conditions
for the existence of an explicit solution to the optimal static attack energy
management problem and the solution is constructed. Compared with the existing
result in which corresponding sufficient conditions work only when the system
matrix is normal, the obtained conditions in this paper are viable for a
general system and shown to be more relaxed. For the other system index, the
average error, the associated sufficient conditions are also derived based on
different analysis with the existing work. And a feasible method is presented
for both indexes when the system cannot meet the sufficient conditions. Then
when the real-time ACK information can be acquired, an MDP based algorithm is
designed to solve the optimal dynamic attack energy management problem. We
further study the optimal tradeoff between attack power and system degradation.
By moving power constraint into the objective function to maximize system index
and minimize energy consumption, the other MDP based algorithm is proposed to
find the optimal attack policy which is further shown to have a monotone
structure. The theoretical results are illustrated by simulations.

quasi-two-dimensional ferromagnet belonging to the family of magnetic layered
transition metal trichalcogenides that have attracted recently a big deal of
interest with regard to the fundamental and applied aspects of two-dimensional
magnetism. For this purpose electron spin resonance (ESR) and ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) measurements have been carried out over a wide frequency and
temperature range. A gradual change in the angular dependence of the ESR
linewidth at temperatures above the ferromagnetic transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ reveals the development of two-dimensional spin correlations in the
vicinity of $T_{\rm c}$ thereby proving the intrinsically low-dimensional
character of spin dynamics in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. Angular and frequency
dependent measurements in the ferromagnetic phase clearly show an easy-axis
type anisotropy of this compound. Furthermore, these experiments are compared
with simulations based on a phenomenological approach, which takes into account
results of static magnetization measurements as well as high temperature $g$
factors obtained from ESR spectroscopy in the paramagnetic phase. As a result
the determined magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density (MAE) $K_U$ is
$(0.48 \pm 0.02) \times10^6$ erg/cm$^3$. This analysis is complemented by
density functional calculations which yield the experimental MAE value for a
particular value of the electronic correlation strength $U$. The analysis of
the electronic structure reveals that the low-lying conduction band carries
almost completely spin-polarized, quasi-homogeneous, two-dimensional states.

multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter-wave systems. In such systems, multi-cluster

result, each active user suffers a significant rate loss. Particularly, a
conventional single beam selection (SBS) scheme is used in an equivalent

to the limited number of the channel propagation clusters per-user. In

of the precoded data streams. Consequently, each active user inherently loses a
huge number of data streams utilizing the conventional SBS scheme. Therefore,
we propose a hybrid beam selection (HBS) scheme in an equivalent beamspace MIMO

- the so-called Brownian gyrator - whose stochastic dynamics is described by a
pair of coupled Langevin equations with different temperature noise terms. This
model is known to produce a curl-carrying non-equilibrium steady-state with
persistent angular rotations. We generalize the original model introducing
constant forces doing work on the gyrator, for which we derive exact asymmetry
relations, that are reminiscent of the standard fluctuation relations. Unlike
the latter, our relations concern instantaneous and not time averaged values of
the observables of interest. We investigate the full two-dimensional dynamics
as well as the dynamics projected on the $x$- and $y$-axes, so that information
about the state of the system can be obtained from just a part of its degrees
of freedom. Such a state is characterized by effective ""temperatures"" that can
be measured in nanoscale devices, but do not have a thermodynamic nature.
Remarkably, the effective temperatures appearing in full dynamics are
distinctly different from the ones emerging in its projections, confirming that
they are not thermodynamic quantities, although they precisely characterize the
state of the system.

the nature of its post-merger remnant. A previous search for post-merger
gravitational waves targeted high-frequency signals from a possible neutron
star remnant with a maximum signal duration of 500 s. Here we revisit the
neutron star remnant scenario with a focus on longer signal durations up until
the end of the Second Advanced LIGO-Virgo Observing run, 8.5 days after the
coalescence of GW170817. The main physical scenario for such emission is the
power-law spindown of a massive magnetar-like remnant. We use four independent
search algorithms with varying degrees of restrictiveness on the signal
waveformand different ways of dealing with noise artefacts. In agreement with
theoretical estimates, we find no significant signal candidates. Through
simulated signals, we quantify that with the current detector sensitivity,
nowhere in the studied parameter space are we sensitive to a signal from more
than 1 Mpc away, compared to the actual distance of 40 Mpc. This study however
serves as a prototype for post-merger analyses in future observing runs with
expected higher sensitivity.

  Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning method for affine image
registration on 3D medical images. Unlike optimisation-based methods, our
affine image registration network (AIRNet) is designed to directly estimate the
transformation parameters between two input images without using any metric,
which represents the quality of the registration, as the optimising function.
But since it is costly to manually identify the transformation parameters
between any two images, we leverage the abundance of cheap unlabelled data to
generate a synthetic dataset for the training of the model. Additionally, the
structure of AIRNet enables us to learn the discriminative features of the
images which are useful for registration purpose. Our proposed method was
evaluated on magnetic resonance images of the axial view of human brain and
compared with the performance of a conventional image registration method.
Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves better overall performance
on registration of images from different patients and modalities with 100x
speed-up in execution time.

merger GW170817 from radio to X-ray are consistent with synchrotron radiation
by shock-accelerated electrons. However, previous afterglow modeling studies
were based on a simplified assumption that the acceleration efficiency is
extremely high, i.e. all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal
population. This affects the estimate of the minimum electron energy and hence
$\nu_m$, the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian
fitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution,
in which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the
maximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below $\nu_m$ in the
early phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency
always above $\nu_m$. Therefore the $\nu_m$ passage through the radio band
could have been clearly detected for GW170817, if sufficient low-frequency
radio data had been taken in early time. In the new solutions, the lowest
energy of electrons is found close to equipartition with the post shock
protons, but only a small fraction ($<$10\%) of electrons are accelerated as
nonthermal particles. The jet energy and interstellar medium density are
increased by 1--2 orders of magnitude from the conventional modeling, though
these are still consistent with other constraints. We encourage to take densely
sampled low-frequency radio data in the early phase for future BNS merger
events, which would potentially detect $\nu_m$ passage and give a strong
constraint on electron energy distribution and particle acceleration
efficiency.

massively modifying the existing transportation infrastructure. For vehicle
localization, vehicles on the road are classified into two categories: host
vehicles (HVs) are the ones used to estimate other vehicles' positions and
forwarding vehicles (FVs) are the ones that move in front of the HVs. The FV
transmits modulated data from the tail (or back) light, and the camera of the
HV receives that signal using optical camera communication (OCC). In addition,
the streetlight (SL) data are considered to ensure the position accuracy of the
HV. Determining the HV position minimizes the relative position variation
between the HV and FV. Using photogrammetry, the distance between FV or SL and
the camera of the HV is calculated by measuring the occupied image area on the
image sensor. Comparing the change in distance between HV and SLs with the
change in distance between HV and FV, the positions of FVs are determined. The
performance of the proposed technique is analyzed, and the results indicate a
significant improvement in performance. The experimental distance measurement

the level of interference from a nearby frequency band. Frequency bands with a

white light emitting diodes (LEDs) and an MR camera are used as transmitters
and receiver respectively. Positioning is a key issue in MRN systems in terms
of accuracy, data rate, and distance. We propose an indoor navigation and
positioning combined algorithm and further evaluate its performance. An android

transmitter links. Experimentally, we received data from four links which are

consideration of transmission losses and logical constraints in ED problems
causes difficulties either in the linearization procedure, or in handling via
heuristic-based approaches, and this may result in outcome violation. The
non-smooth terms can make the situation even worse. On the other hand,
non-convex nonlinear models with logical constraints are not solvable using the
existing nonlinear commercial solvers. In order to explain and remedy these
shortcomings, we proposed a novel recasting strategy to overcome the hurdle of
solving such complicated problems with the aid of the existing nonlinear
solvers. The proposed model can facilitate the pre-solving and probing
techniques of the commercial solvers by recasting the logical constraints into
the mixed-integer terms of the objective function. It consequently results in a
higher accuracy of the model and better computational efficiency. The acquired
results demonstrated that the LB-MINLP model, compared to the existing

the non-smooth and nonlinear terms and achieve an optimal solution much faster

Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) of heavy metal/ferromagnetic insulator bilayer

an accumulation of spin near the bilayer interface, giving rise to a
magnoresistance which is not invariant under inversion of the current
direction. Unlike the electronic contribution described by Zhang and Vignale
[Phys. Rev. B 94, 140411 (2016)], which requires an electrically conductive
ferromagnet, the magnonic contribution can occur in ferromagnetic insulators
such as yttrium iron garnet. We show that the magnonic USMR is, to leading
order, cubic in the spin Hall angle of the heavy metal, as opposed to the
linear relation found for the electronic contribution. We estimate that the
maximal magnonic USMR in Pt|YIG bilayers is on the order of $10^{-8}$, but may
reach values of up to $10^{-5}$ if the magnon gap is suppressed, and can thus
become comparable to the electronic contribution in, e.g., Pt|Co. We show that
the magnonic USMR at a finite magnon gap may be enhanced by an order of
magnitude if the magnon diffusion length is decreased to a specific optimal
value that depends on various system parameters.

domain of empirical validity of another is widely known as ""reduction."" Here it
is argued that one popular methodology for showing that one theory reduces to
another, associated with the so-called ""Bronstein cube"" of physical theories,
rests on an over-simplified characterization of the type of mathematical
relationship between theories that typically underpins reduction. An
alternative methodology, based on a certain simple geometrical relationship
between dis- tinct state space models of the same physical system, is then
described and illustrated with examples. Within this approach, it is shown how
and under what conditions inter-model reductions involving distinct model pairs
can be composed or chained together to yield a direct reduction between
theoretically remote descriptions of the same system. Building on this
analysis, we consider cases in which a single reduction between two models may
be effected via distinct composite reductions differing in their intermediate
layer of description, and motivate a set of formal consistency requirements on
the mappings between model state spaces and on the subsets of the model state
spaces that characterize such reductions. These constraints are explicitly
shown to hold in the reduction of a non-relativistic classical model to a model
of relativistic quantum mechanics, which may be effected via distinct composite
reductions in which the intermediate layer of description is either a model of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics or of relativistic classical mechanics. Some
brief speculations are offered as to whether and how this sort of consistency
requirement between distinct composite reductions might serve to constrain the
relationship that any unification of the Standard Model with general relativity
must bear to these theories.

Computer Aided Design (CAD) and the Finite Cell Method (FCM) for models with

order finite elements, embeds the physical model into a fictitious domain,
which can be discretized without having to take into account the boundary of
the physical domain. The true geometry is captured by a precise numerical
integration of elements cut by the boundary. Thus, an effective Point
Membership Classification algorithm that determines the inside-outside state of
an integration point with respect to the physical domain is a core operation in
FCM. To treat also ""dirty geometries"", i.e. imprecise or flawed geometric
models, a combination of a segment-triangle intersection algorithm and a flood
fill algorithm being insensitive to most CAD model flaws is proposed to
identify the affiliation of the integration points. The present method thus
allows direct computations on geometrically and topologically flawed models.
The potential and merit for practical applications of the proposed method is
demonstrated by several numerical examples.

elliptical mass distribution (SPEMD) plus external shear, to different levels
of complexity. We show that relaxing the isothermal constraint of the SPEMD is
not statistically significant, and thus we simplify the SPEMD to a singular
isothermal ellipsoid to estimate the Einstein radius of the main lens galaxy
$\theta_{\text{E}} = 0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}851$, the intensity and position
angle of the external shear $(\gamma,\theta_{\gamma}) =

We provide time delay predictions for pairs of images, assuming a plausible
range of lens redshift values $z_l$ between $0.5$ and $0.9$. We finally examine
the impact on time delays of the so-called Source Position Transformation, a
family of degeneracies existing between different lens density profiles that
reproduce most of the lensing observables equally well. We show that this
effect contributes significantly to the time delay error budget and cannot be
ignored during the modeling. This has implications for robust cosmography
applications of lensed systems. GRAL113100-441959 is the first in a series of
seven new spectroscopically confirmed GLs discovered from Gaia Data Release 2.

It is of great interest for noise problems in various areas of industrial
application. First principle based CAA with short response time are needed in
the industrial design process for reliable prediction of spectral differences
in turbulent-boundary-layer trailing-edge noise due to design modifications. In
this paper, an aeroacoustic method is studied, resting on a hybrid CFD/CAA
procedure. In a first step RANS simulation provides a time-averaged solution,
including the mean-flow and turbulence statistics such as length-scale,
time-scale and turbulence kinetic energy. Based on these, fluctuating sound
sources are then stochastically generated by the Fast Random Particle-Mesh
Method to simulate in a second CAA step broadband aeroacoustic sound. From
experimental findings it is well known that porous trailing edges significantly
lower trailing edge noise level over a large range of frequencies reaching up
to 8dB reduction. Furthermore, sound reduction depends on the porous material
parameters, e.g. geometry, porosity, permeability and pore size. The paper
presents first results for an extended hybrid CFD/CAA method including porous
materials with prescribed parameters. To incorporate the effect of porosity, an
extended formulation of the Acoustic Perturbation Equations with source terms
is derived based on a reformulation of the volume averaged Navier-Stokes
equations into perturbation form. Proper implementation of the Darcy and
Forchheimer terms is verified for sound propagation in homogeneous and

Selecting the best method to reconstruct an image to a higher resolution with

major drawback from the existing enlargement techniques is the introduction of
color bleeding while interpolating pixels over the edges that separate distinct
colors in an image. The color bleeding causes to accentuate the edges with new

paper proposes a novel approach to mitigate the color bleeding by segmenting
the homogeneous color regions of the image using Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC) and applying a higher order interpolation technique
separately on the isolated segments. The interpolation at the boundaries of
each of the isolated segments is handled by using a morphological operation.
The approach is evaluated by comparing against several frequently used image

understand and predict the quantum dynamics. Remarkably, the resonance
phenomenon in oscillating quantum systems has challenged the adiabatic theorem.
In this scenario, inconsistencies in the application of quantitative adiabatic
conditions have led to a sequence of new approaches for adiabaticity. Here, by
adopting a different strategy, we introduce a validation mechanism for the
adiabatic approximation by driving the quantum system to a non-inertial
reference frame. More specifically, we begin by considering several relevant
adiabatic approximation conditions previously derived and show that all of them
fail by introducing a suitable oscillating Hamiltonian for a single quantum bit
(qubit). Then, by evaluating the adiabatic condition in a rotated non-inertial
frame, we show that all of these conditions, including the standard adiabatic
condition, can correctly describe the adiabatic dynamics in the original frame,
either far from resonance or at a resonant point. Moreover, we prove that this
validation mechanism can be extended for general multi-particle quantum
systems, establishing the conditions for the equivalence of the adiabatic
behavior as described in inertial or non-inertial frames. In order to

agent that performs hierarchical active inference across a human and a machine
part. We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with
an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could
accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish
this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by
explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and
physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the
amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability
to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order
to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with
increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about
environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation
in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine,
human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can
be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment,
body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine
learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared
representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards
hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the
art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation
might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and
suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to
execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.

privacy-preserving approaches to the problem. In this paper, we present a

cultural groups in the receiving country. The refugee crisis of 2015 has
resulted in critical levels of opinion polarization on the question of whether
to welcome migrants, causing clashes in receiving countries. This scenario
emphasizes the need to better understand the dynamics of mutual adaptation
between locals and migrants, and the conditions that favor successful
integration. Agent-based simulations can help achieve this goal. In this work,
we introduce our model MigrAgent and our preliminary results. The model
synthesizes the dynamics of migration intake and post-migration adaptation. It
explores the different acculturation outcomes that can emerge from the mutual
adaptation of a migrant population and a local population depending on their
degree of tolerance. With parameter sweeping, we detect how different
acculturation strategies can coexist in a society and in different degrees
among various subgroups. The results show higher polarization effects between a
local population and a migrant population for fast intake conditions. When
migrant intake is slow, transitory conditions between acculturation outcomes
emerge for subgroups, e.g., from assimilation to integration for liberal
migrants and from marginalization to separation for conservative migrants.
Relative group sizes due to speed of intake cause counterintuitive scenarios,
such as the separation of liberal locals. We qualitatively compare the
processes of our model with the German portion sample of the survey Causes and
Consequences of Socio-Cultural Integration Processes among New Immigrants in

the sphere's boundary is fully covered by biological receptors that may
irreversibly react with hitting molecules. Moreover, information molecules
diffusing in the sphere may undergo a degradation reaction and be transformed
to another molecule type. Concentration Green's function (CGF) of diffusion
inside this environment is analytically obtained in terms of a convergent

number $\kappa$ of the local functions as well as the network topology and

time $O((\tau_{\max} +

$\epsilon$ where $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the graph, $\tau_{\max}$ the

Therefore, it matches the rate of $SSDA$, which is optimal when $\tau_{\max} =

a starting point. It is widely known that this construction can - with the
right ingredients - be generalized to Artin groups of finite type. Results of
Bessis as well as Brady and Watt are used to establish the general construction
for Artin groups of finite type. The non-crossing partition lattice in finite
Coxeter groups is identified and used to generate the so called poset group.
With the help of this poset group, which turns out to be isomorphic to the
Artin group, a simplicial complex is constructed on which the poset group acts.
It is shown that the complex itself is the universal cover of the $K(\pi,1)$ of
the Artin group of finite type and the quotient under the action is the desired
$K(\pi,1)$.

Telescope AGN Catalog (3LAC). A core-jet structure, visible in radio and
X-rays, is enclosed within a $\sim$220 kpc wide radio structure. The morphology
and spectral characteristics of the kiloparsec jet in radio and X-rays are
typical of Fanaroff-Riley type I galaxies. The analysis of the radio data and
optical spectrum and different diagnostic methods based on the optical,
infrared and $\gamma$-ray luminosities also support a classification as a
low-power radio galaxy seen at moderate angles
($\theta=$10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$). In the framework of leptonic models, the
high-energy peak of the non-thermal nuclear spectral energy distribution can be
explained in terms of synchrotron-self-Compton emission from a jet seen at
$\theta\sim$15$^\circ$. Similarly to other misaligned AGNs detected by Fermi,
the required bulk motion is lower ($\Gamma_{\rm bulk}=$4) than the values
inferred in BL Lac objects, confirming that, because of the de-boosting of
emission from the highly-relativistic blazar region, these nearby systems are
valuable targets to probe the existence of multiple sites of production of the
most energetic emission in the jets.

In this paper we investigate the possibility to perform an online, distributed

implement advanced network features like distributed modelling, self-optimizing
protocols, and anomaly detection, to name a few. The proposed approach, called
DOWSN (Distributed Optimization for WSN) is an island-model infrastructure in
which each node executes a simple, computationally cheap (both in terms of CPU
and memory) optimization algorithm, and shares promising solutions with its
neighbors. We perform extensive tests of different DOWSN configurations on a
benchmark made up of continuous optimization problems; we analyze the influence
of the network parameters (number of nodes, inter-node communication period and
probability of accepting incoming solutions) on the optimization performance.
Finally, we profile energy and memory consumption of DOWSN to show the
efficient usage of the limited hardware resources available on the sensor
nodes.

prohibitive as the density of the models increases. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for supporting fast and efficient spectral processing of dense

achieve that, we apply the problem of tracking graph Laplacian eigenspaces via
orthogonal iterations, exploiting potential spectral coherence between adjacent

used for all the individual parts, we propose a flexible solution that
automatically identifies the optimal subspace size for satisfying a given

different 3D meshes in compression and denoising setups, showed that the
proposed schemes are very fast alternatives of SVD based spectral processing
while achieving at the same time similar or even better reconstruction quality.
More importantly, the proposed approach can be employed by several other
state-of-the-art denoising methods as a preprocessing step, optimizing both
their reconstruction quality and their computational complexity.

there is an underlying $k$-regular graph connecting the bins. The three schemes
are variants of power-of-$d$ choices, except that the sampling of $d$ bins at
each time are based on the locations of $d$ independently moving
non-backtracking random walkers, with the positions of the random walkers being
reset when certain events occurs. We show that under some conditions for the
underlying graph that can be summarized as the graph having large enough girth,
all three schemes can perform as well as power-of-$d$, so that the maximum load
is bounded by $\log\log n/\log d+O(1)$ with high probability.

paper on \emph{Sinkhorn divergences} (SDs), a regularized variant of OT
distances which can interpolate, depending on the regularization strength
$\varepsilon$, between OT ($\varepsilon=0$) and MMD ($\varepsilon=\infty$).
Although the tradeoff induced by that regularization is now well understood
computationally (OT, SDs and MMD require respectively $O(n^3\log n)$, $O(n^2)$
and $n^2$ operations given a sample size $n$), much less is known in terms of
their \emph{sample complexity}, namely the gap between these quantities, when
evaluated using finite samples \emph{vs.} their respective densities. Indeed,
while the sample complexity of OT and MMD stand at two extremes, $1/n^{1/d}$
for OT in dimension $d$ and $1/\sqrt{n}$ for MMD, that for SDs has only been
studied empirically. In this paper, we \emph{(i)} derive a bound on the

reformulating SDs as a maximization problem in a RKHS. We thus obtain a scaling

complexity obtained directly from the wave function is sensitive to time
evolution, leaving us to claim that it surpasses the other approaches. We also
demonstrate that circuit complexity displays a universal behaviour---the
complexity is proportional to the number of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions
that act on a reference state. Due to this fact, for a given number of
Hamiltonians, we can always find the combination of states that provides the
maximum complexity; consequently, other combinations involving a smaller number
of evolutions will have less than maximum complexity and, hence, will have
resources. Finally, we explore the evolution of complexity in non-local
theories; we demonstrate the growth of complexity is sustained over a longer
period of time as compared to a local theory.

symmetric random walk, except that, with a certain fixed probability, at each
step, it chooses instead to jump to a given site with probability proportional
to the time it has already spent there. This process has been analyzed in the
physics literature under the name ""random walk with preferential relocations"",
where it is argued that the position of the walker after $n$ steps, scaled by
$\log n$, converges to a Gaussian random variable; because of the $\log$
spatial scaling, the process is said to undergo a ""slow diffusion"".
  In this paper, we generalize this model by allowing the underlying random
walk to be any Markov process and the random run-lengths (time between two
relocations) to be i.i.d.-distributed. We also allow the memory of the walker
to fade with time, meaning that when a relocations occurs, the walker is more
likely to go back to a place it has visited more recently.
  We prove rigorously the central limit theorem described above (plus a local
limit theorem and the convergence of the weighted occupation measure) by
associating to the process a growing family of vertex-weighted random recursive
trees and a Markov chain indexed by this tree. The spatial scaling of our
relocated random walk is related to the height of a ""typical"" vertex in the
random tree. This typical height can range from doubly-logarithmic to
logarithmic or even a power of the number of nodes of the tree, depending on
the form of the memory.

Kohn anomalies and the Labb\'e-Friedel distortion. Then the physics of dilute
alloys is discussed. The analogy with nuclear collisions was a fruitful
starting point, which suggested one should analyse the effects of impurities in
terms of a scattering problem with the introduction of phase shifts. Starting
from these concepts, Friedel derived a theory of the resistivity of alloys, and
a celebrated sum rule relating the phase shifts at the Fermi level to the
number of electrons in the impurity, which turned out to play a prominent role
later in the context of correlated impurities, as for instance in the Kondo
effect. Friedel oscillations are also an important result, related to
incommensurate magnetic structures. It is shown how they can be derived in
various ways: from collision theory, perturbation theory, self-consistent
approximations and Green's function methods. While collision theory does not
permit to take the crystal structure into account, which is responsible for
electronic bands, those effects can be included in other descriptions, using
for instance the tight binding approximation.

(IWAC and WAC-AE) technique applied to cooperative spectrum sensing problem in
cognitive radio systems. This method allows the secondary users cooperate based
on only local information exchange without a fusion centre (FC). We have
compared four rules of average consensus (AC) algorithms. The first rule is the
simple AC without weights. The AC rule presents {performance comparable to the
traditional cooperative spectrum sensing} (CSS) techniques, such as the equal
gain combining (EGC) rule, which is a soft combining centralised method.
Another technique is the weighted average consensus (WAC) rule using the
weights based on the SUs channel condition. This technique results in a
performance similar to the maximum ratio combining (MRC) with soft combining
(centralised CSS). Two new AC rules are analysed, namely weighted average
consensus accuracy exchange (WAC-AE), and improved weighted average consensus
(IWAC); the former relates the weights to the channel conditions of the SUs
neighbours, while the latter combines the conditions of WAC and WAC-AE in the
same rule. All methods are compared each other and with the hard combining
centralised CSS. The WAC-AE results in a similar performance of WAC technique
but with fast convergence, while the IWAC can deliver suitable performance with
small complexity increment{. Moreover, IWAC method results in a similar
convergence rate than the WAC-AE method but slightly higher than the AC and WAC
methods}. Hence, the computational complexity of IWAC, WAC-AE, and WAC are
proven to be very similar. The analyses are based on the numerical Monte-Carlo
simulations (MCS), while algorithm's convergence is evaluated for both fixed
and dynamic-mobile communication scenarios, and under AWGN and Rayleigh
channels.

agave juices that has been produced for centuries. Its preparation and testing
involves an artisanal method to determine the alcohol content based on pouring
a stream of the liquid into a small vessel: if the alcohol content is correct,
stable bubbles, known as pearls, form at the surface and remain floating for
some time. It has been hypothesized that an increase in bubble lifetime results
from a decrease in surface tension due to added surfactants. However, the
precise mechanism for extended lifetime remains unexplained. By conducting
experiments and numerical simulations, we studied the extended lifetime of
pearls. It was found that both changes in fluid properties (resulting from
mixing ethanol and water) and the presence of surfactants are needed to observe
pearls with a long lifetime. Moreover, we found that the dimensionless lifetime
of a bubble first increases with the Bond number, until reaching a maximum at
$Bo\approx 1$, and then continuously decreases. Our findings on bubble
stability in Mezcal not only explain the effectiveness of the artisanal method,
but it also provides insight to other fields where floating bubbles are
relevant such as in oceanic foam, bio-foams, froth flotation and magma flows.

$a\in(-\alpha,\infty)$ and $0<p<p_{c}(a):=\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$. By
using the method of scaling spheres, we prove Liouville theorems for the above

$a\in(-\alpha,\infty)$ and $p\in(0,p_{c}(a))$. When $a>0$, we covered the gap
$p\in\big[\frac{n+\alpha+a}{n-\alpha},p_{c}(a)\big)$. In particular, when
$\alpha=2$, our results give an affirmative answer to the conjecture posed by
Phan and Souplet \cite{PS}. As a consequence, we derive a priori estimates and
existence of positive solutions to higher order Lane-Emden equations in bounded
domains for all $1<p<\frac{n+2m}{n-2m}$. Our theorems improve the results in
\cite{CFL,DPQ} remarkably to the maximal range of $p$. For bounded domains
$\Omega$, we also apply the method of scaling spheres to derive Liouville
theorems for super-critical problems. Extensions to PDEs and IEs with general
nonlinearities $f(x,u)$ are also included. We believe the method of scaling
spheres developed here can be applied conveniently to various fractional or

largest absolute value of the subdeterminants of the constraint matrix. In this
paper we give an algorithm that finds an epsilon-approximate solution for this
problem by solving a number of integer linear programs whose constraint
matrices have subdeterminants bounded by D in absolute value. The number of
these integer linear programs is polynomial in the dimension n, in D and in
1/epsilon, provided that the number k of variables that appear nonlinearly in
the objective is fixed. As a corollary, we obtain the first polynomial-time
approximation algorithm for separable concave integer quadratic programming
with D at most two and k fixed. In the totally unimodular case D=1, we give an
improved algorithm that only needs to solve a number of linear programs that is
polynomial in 1/epsilon and is independent on n, provided that k is fixed.

coalescence gravitational wave (GW) candidates from Advanced LIGO's first
observing run (O1). As demonstrated by the multimessenger observations of
GW170817/GRB 170817A, electromagnetic and GW observations provide complementary
information about the astrophysical source and, in the case of weaker
candidates, may strengthen the case for an astrophysical origin. Here we
investigate low-significance GW candidates from the O1 compact-binary
coalescence searches using the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), leveraging
its all-sky and broad energy coverage. Candidates are ranked and compared to
background to measure significance. Those with false alarm rates of less than
10^-5 Hz (about one per day) are used as the search sample for gamma-ray
follow-up. No GW candidates were found to be coincident with gamma-ray
transients independently identified by blind searches of the GBM data. In
addition, GW candidate event times were followed up by a separate targeted
search of GBM data. Among the resulting GBM events, the two with lowest false
alarm rates were the gamma-ray transient GW150914-GBM presented in Connaughton
et al. (2016) and a solar flare in chance coincidence with a GW candidate.

taking with Pb+Pb collisions at 150$A$ GeV/c. An exploratory set of collected
data allowed to validate the general concept of the $D^0$ mesons detection via
its $D^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ + K^-$ decay channel and delivered the first direct

radar (SAR) technology for detecting buried and obscured targets, e.g. bomb or
mine, has been successfully demonstrated recently. Despite promising recent
progress, a significant open challenge is to distinguish obscured targets from
other (natural and manmade) clutter sources in the scene. The problem becomes
exacerbated in the presence of noisy responses from rough ground surfaces. In
this paper, we present three novel sparsity-driven techniques, which not only
exploit the subtle features of raw captured data but also take advantage of the
polarization diversity and the aspect angle dependence information from
multi-channel SAR data. First, the traditional sparse representation-based
classification (SRC) is generalized to exploit shared information of classes
and various sparsity structures of tensor coefficients for multi-channel data.
Corresponding tensor dictionary learning models are consequently proposed to
enhance classification accuracy. Lastly, a new tensor sparsity model is
proposed to model responses from multiple consecutive looks of objects, which
is a unique characteristic of the dataset we consider. Extensive experimental
results on a high-fidelity electromagnetic simulated dataset and radar data
collected from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory side-looking SAR demonstrate
the advantages of proposed tensor sparsity models.

simulations of cold fronts in viscous gas, and estimating the gas tangential
velocity from centripetal acceleration, we constrain the effective viscosity to
be at most 1/5 of Spitzer isotropic viscosity, but consistent with full
Braginskii anisotropic viscosity for magnetized plasma. While the northwestern
front does not show obvious eddies, its shape and the structure of its
brightness profile suggest KH eddies seen in projection. The southern cold
front continues in a spiral to the center of the cluster, ending with another
cold front only 12 kpc from the gas density peak. The cool peak itself is
displaced ~30 kpc from the BCG (the biggest such offset among centrally-peaked
clusters), while the X-ray emission on a larger scale is still centered on the
BCG, indicating that the BCG is at the center of the gravitational potential
and the cool gas is sloshing in it. The specific entropy index of the gas in
the peak ($K\approx49$ keV cm$^2$) makes A2142 a rare ""warm core""; apparently
the large displacement of the cool peak by sloshing is the reason. Finally, we
find a subtle narrow, straight channel with a 10% drop in X-ray brightness,

clearly cuts models with $\mu\,,\,\Sigma>1$. This effect is less prevalent in
the Horndeski case due to the larger amount of free functions in the theory.

fund allocations in the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market. The existing scoring
approaches focus on only either probability of default (PD) prediction, known
as credit scoring, or profitability prediction, known as profit scoring, to
identify the best loans for investment. Credit scoring fails to deliver the
main need of lenders on how much profit they may obtain through their
investment. On the other hand, profit scoring can satisfy that need by
predicting the investment profitability. However, profit scoring completely
ignores the class imbalance problem where most of the past loans are
non-default. Consequently, ignorance of the class imbalance problem
significantly affects the accuracy of profitability prediction. Our proposed
two-stage scoring approach is an integration of credit scoring and profit
scoring to address the above challenges. More specifically, stage 1 is designed
as credit scoring to identify non-default loans while the imbalanced nature of
loan status is considered in PD prediction. The loans identified as non-default
are then moved to stage 2 for prediction of profitability, measured by internal
rate of return. Wide and deep learning is used to build the predictive models
in both stages to achieve both memorization and generalization. Extensive
numerical studies are conducted based on real-world data to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. The numerical studies indicate our

characterization of acoustic properties of various biomaterials and biological
tissues. It has the potential to be a favorable imaging modality in contrast
ultrasound imaging with coated microbubbles. However, the development of
effective means for evaluating the nonlinearity parameter of suspensions of
ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs, also known as bubbly liquids) remains open.
The present paper formulates a new equation based on the thermodynamic method
that correlates both attenuation and phase velocity of linear ultrasound. The
simplicity of the present method makes the B/A estimation possible with a
relatively rigorous mathematical derivation. The calculated nonlinearity
parameter contains the contribution of dynamic effects of bubbles, and its
low-frequency limit agrees with B/A estimated by the method of mixture law when
the volume fraction is below 10-4. Furthermore, the maximum B/A in bubbly
liquids can reach up to105, while the minimum can be as low as -105. The
negative nonlinearity parameter indicates significantly different thermodynamic
properties of bubbly liquids.

fully directional and broadcast. In the former, the source nodes transmit a

whereas, in the latter, the nodes transmit to both the destination and the

occurs every time a transmitter node changes the destination node. We show how

the optimal transmission scheme (i.e., broadcast or fully directional) for

visibility of the monochromatic constituents corresponding to three color

width and visibility over the imaging field of view. This leads to an unwanted

Spread nets are (safe)
Petri nets equipped with vector clocks on places and with ticking functions on
transitions, and are such that vector clocks are consistent with the ticking of
transitions. Such nets generalize previous families of nets like unfoldings,
merged processes and trellis processes, and can thus be used to represent runs
of a net in a true concurrency semantics through an operation called the
spreading of a net. By contrast with previous constructions, which may identify
conflicts, spread nets allow loops in time

structures as the combination of simple agents, memes, whose evolutionary
interactions lead to intelligent structures capable of problem-solving. This
paper focuses on Memetic Computing optimization algorithms and proposes a
counter-tendency approach for algorithmic design. Research in the field tends
to go in the direction of improving existing algorithms by combining different
methods or through the formulation of more complicated structures. Contrary to
this trend, we instead focus on simplicity, proposing a structurally simple
algorithm with emphasis on processing only one solution at a time. The proposed
algorithm, namely Three Stage Optimal Memetic Exploration, is composed of three
memes; the first stochastic and with a long search radius, the second
stochastic and with a moderate search radius and the third deterministic and
with a short search radius. The bottom-up combination of the three operators by
means of a natural trial and error logic, generates a robust and efficient
optimizer, capable of competing with modern complex and computationally
expensive algorithms. This is suggestive of the fact that complexity in
algorithmic structures can be unnecessary, if not detrimental, and that simple
bottom-up approaches are likely to be competitive is here invoked as an
extension to Memetic Computing basing on the philosophical concept of Ockham's
Razor. An extensive experimental setup on various test problems and one digital
signal processing application is presented. Numerical results show that the
proposed approach, despite its simplicity and low computational cost displays a
very good performance on several problems, and is competitive with
sophisticated algorithms representing the-state-of-the-art in computational
intelligence optimization.

  insurance portfolio",,,,,"q-fin.PM q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rate change calculations in the literature involve deterministic methods that
measure the change in premium for a given policy. The definition of rate change
as a statistical parameter is proposed to address the stochastic nature of the
premium charged for a policy. It promotes the idea that rate change is a
property of an asymptotic population to be estimated, not just a property to
measure or monitor in the sample of observed policies that are written. Various
models and techniques are given for estimating this stochastic rate change and
quantifying the uncertainty in the estimates. The use of matched sampling is
emphasized for rate change estimation, as it adjusts for changes in policy
characteristics by directly searching for similar policies across policy years.
This avoids any of the assumptions and recipes that are required to re-rate
policies in years where they were not written, as is common with deterministic
methods. Such procedures can be subjective or implausible if the structure of
rating algorithms change or there are complex and heterogeneous exposure bases
and coverages. The methods discussed are applied to a motor premium database.
The application includes the use of a genetic algorithm with parallel
computations to automatically optimize the matched sampling.

spin-torque nano-oscillators consisting of an out-of-plane magnetized free
layer and an in-plane polarizer is necessary to stabilize out-of-plane
magnetization precession without the need of external magnetic fields. As the
in-plane anisotropy is increased, a gradual tilting of the magnetization
towards the in-plane easy direction is introduced, favouring zero-field
dynamics over static in-plane states. Above a critical value, zero-field
dynamics are no longer observed. The optimum ratio of in-plane shape to
out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy, for which large angle out-of-plane zero-field
dynamics occur within the widest current range, is reported.

the majority of people now living in large cities. This population
concentration is capable of boosting the growth of positive indicators such as
innovation, the production of new patents and supercreative employment, but
increases the spread of diseases and the occurrence of crimes. Faced with the
realization that crime rates grow year after year in these large urban centers,
we sought to understand the dynamics of crime within cities. We investigate at
the subscale of the neighborhoods of a highly populated city the incidence of
property crimes in terms of both the resident and the floating population. Our
results show that a relevant allometric relation could only be observed between
property crimes and floating population. More precisely, the evidence of a
superlinear behavior indicates that a disproportional number of property crimes
occurs in regions where an increased flow of people takes place in the city.
For comparison, we also found that the number of crimes of peace disturbance
only correlates well, and in a superlinear fashion too, with the resident
population. Our study raises the interesting possibility that the
superlinearity observed in previous studies [Bettencourt et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 104, 7301 (2007) and Melo et al., Sci. Rep. 4, 6239 (2014)] for
homicides versus population at the city scale could have its origin in the fact
that the floating population, and not the resident one, should be taken as the
relevant variable determining the intrinsic microdynamical behavior of the
system. This finding was the motivation for the codification of a framework
that supports the analysis of population and crime data to propose city
divisions that allow the allocation of police by floating population and
resident population statistics.

not predicted and must be evaluated by calculating Coulomb and exchange
interactions over the predicted orbitals. Transferable potentials for first-row
atoms and transition metal oxides that can be used without modification in
different molecules are reported. For improved accuracy, molecular
wavefunctions can be refined by slightly scaling nuclear charges and by
introducing potentials optimized for functional groups. For a test set of 20
molecules representing different bonding environments, the transferable
potentials with scaling give wavefunctions with energies that deviate from
exact self-consistent field or configuration interaction energies by less than
0.05 eV and 0.02 eV per bond or valence electron pair, respectively.
