a 4.5-d, transiting orbit around the star TYC 7282-1298-1 ($V$ = 10.8, F5V).
The planet has been pursued by the NGTS team as NGTS-2b and by ourselves as
WASP-179b. We characterised the system using a combination of photometry from
WASP-South and TRAPPIST-South, and spectra from CORALIE (around the orbit) and
HARPS (through the transit). We find the planet's orbit to be nearly aligned
with its star's spin. From a detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, we
measure a projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -19 \pm 6^\circ$. From
line-profile tomography of the same spectra, we measure $\lambda = -11 \pm
5^\circ$. We find the planet to have a low density ($M_{\rm P}$ = 0.67 $\pm$
0.09 $M_{\rm Jup}$, $R_{\rm P}$ = 1.54 $\pm$ 0.06 $R_{\rm Jup}$), which, along
with its moderately bright host star, makes it a good target for transmission
spectroscopy. We find a lower stellar mass ($M_*$ = $1.30 \pm 0.07$ $M_\odot$)
than reported by the NGTS team ($M_*$ = $1.64 \pm 0.21$ $M_\odot$), though the
difference is only $1.5$ $\sigma$.

30 quasars at z>5 that are hyper-luminous in the infrared ($\mu$$L_{\rm
IR}>10^{13}$ L$_{\odot}$, where $\mu$ is a lensing magnification factor), the
possibility has opened up for SPICA, the proposed ESA M5 mid-/far-infrared
mission, to extend its spectroscopic studies toward the epoch of reionization
and beyond. In this paper, we examine the feasibility and scientific potential
of such observations with SPICA's far-infrared spectrometer SAFARI, which will
probe a spectral range (35-230 $\mu$m) that will be unexplored by ALMA and
JWST. Our simulations show that SAFARI is capable of delivering good-quality
spectra for hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs) at z=5-10, allowing us
to sample spectral features in the rest-frame mid-infrared and to investigate a
host of key scientific issues, such as the relative importance of star
formation versus AGN, the hardness of the radiation field, the level of
chemical enrichment, and the properties of the molecular gas. From a broader
perspective, SAFARI offers the potential to open up a new frontier in the study
of the early Universe, providing access to uniquely powerful spectral features
for probing first-generation objects, such as the key cooling lines of
low-metallicity or metal-free forming galaxies (fine-structure and H2 lines)
and emission features of solid compounds freshly synthesized by Population III
supernovae. Ultimately, SAFARI's ability to explore the high-redshift Universe
will be determined by the availability of sufficiently bright targets (whether
intrinsically luminous or gravitationally lensed). With its launch expected
around 2030, SPICA is ideally positioned to take full advantage of upcoming
wide-field surveys such as LSST, SKA, Euclid, and WFIRST, which are likely to
provide extraordinary targets for SAFARI.

measures obtained at constant values of pH and redox potential are important
tools as they serve to, among other things, provide additional atomic level

enhanced sampling technique that allows converged results to be obtained faster
in comparison to regular molecular dynamics simulations. In this work we report
the implementation, also available with GPU-accelerated code, of pH and redox
potential (E) as options for multidimensional REMD simulations in AMBER.
Previous publications have only reported multidimensional REMD simulations with
the temperature and Hamiltonian dimensions. In this work results are shown for
N-acetylmicroperoxidase-8 (NAcMP8) axially connected to a histidine peptide.
This is a small system that contains only a single heme group. We compare
results from E,pH-REMD, E,T-REMD and E,T,pH-REMD to one dimensional REMD
simulations and to simulations without REMD. We show that 2D-REMD simulations
improve sampling convergence in comparison to 1D-REMD simulations, and that
3D-REMD further improves convergence in comparison to 2D-REMD simulations.
Also, our computational benchmarks show that our multidimensional REMD
calculations have a small and bearable computational performance, essentially
the same as one dimensional REMD. However, in multidimensional REMD a
significantly higher number of replicas is required as the number of replicas
scales geometrically with the number of dimensions, which requires additional
computational resources. In addition to the pH dependence on standard redox
potential values and the redox potential dependence on pKa values,we also
investigate the influence of the temperature in our results. We observe an

dynamics is that every individual player has full knowledge about and full
access to the complete set of available strategies. In realistic social,
economical, and political systems, diversity in the knowledge, experience, and
background among the individuals can be expected. Games in which the players do
not have an identical strategy set are hypergames. Studies of hypergame
dynamics have been scarce, especially those on networks. We investigate
evolutionary hypergame dynamics on regular lattices using a prototypical model
of three available strategies, in which the strategy set of each player
contains two of the three strategies. Our computations reveal that more complex
dynamical phases emerge from the system than those from the traditional
evolutionary game dynamics with full knowledge of the complete set of available
strategies, which include single-strategy absorption phases, a cyclic
competition (`rock-paper-scissors') type of phase, and an uncertain phase in
which the dominant strategy adopted by the population is unpredictable.
Exploiting the pair interaction and mean field approximations, we obtain a
qualitative understanding of the emergence of the single strategy and uncertain
phases. We find the striking phenomenon of strategy revival associated with the
cyclic competition phase and provide a qualitative explanation.Our work
demonstrates that the diversity in the individuals' strategy set can play an
important role in the evolution of strategy distribution in the system. From
the point of view of control, the emergence of the complex phases offers the
possibility for harnessing evolutionary game dynamics through small changes in
individuals' probability of strategy adoption.

in bottom-up holographic models. The deconfinement in AdS/QCD is related to the
Hawking-Page phase transition, in which the critical Hawking temperature is
identified with the deconfinement one in the gauge theory. The numeric
estimation of the latter is only possible when the parameters of a $5D$ dual
model are previously determined from consistency with other physical aspects,
standardly, providing a description of the QCD resonances. The traditional way
to fix parameters in the simplest AdS/QCD models is to reproduce the mass of
the $\rho$ meson or the slope of the approximate radial Regge trajectory of the
$\rho$ excitations. Motivated by a general idea that the slope value originates
in gluodynamics, we propose calculating the deconfinement temperature using the
trajectory of scalar glueballs. We consider several holographic models and use
the recent idea of isospectral potentials to make an additional check of the
relevance of our approach. It is demonstrated that different models from an
isospectral family (i.e. the models leading to identical predictions for
spectrum of hadrons with fixed quantum numbers) result in different predictions
for the deconfinement temperature. This difference is found to be quite small
in the scalar glueball channel but very large in the vector meson channel. The
observed stability in the former case clearly favours the choice of the
glueball channel for thermodynamic predictions in AdS/QCD models. For a
balanced approach, we argue that either assuming $f_0(1500)$ to have a
dominating component of $0^{++}$ glueball or accepting the idea of the
universality in the radial Regge trajectories of light non-strange vector
mesons one can reproduce the results for the deconfinement temperature obtained
before in the lattice simulations in the background of non-dynamical quarks.

learning has emerged as a promising approach to solving continuous control
robotic tasks. The research community is now able to reproduce, analyze and
build quickly on these results due to open source implementations of learning
algorithms and simulated benchmark tasks. To carry forward these successes to
real-world applications, it is crucial to withhold utilizing the unique
advantages of simulations that do not transfer to the real world and experiment
directly with physical robots. However, reinforcement learning research with
physical robots faces substantial resistance due to the lack of benchmark tasks
and supporting source code. In this work, we introduce several reinforcement
learning tasks with multiple commercially available robots that present varying
levels of learning difficulty, setup, and repeatability. On these tasks, we
test the learning performance of off-the-shelf implementations of four
reinforcement learning algorithms and analyze sensitivity to their
hyper-parameters to determine their readiness for applications in various
real-world tasks. Our results show that with a careful setup of the task
interface and computations, some of these implementations can be readily
applicable to physical robots. We find that state-of-the-art learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to their hyper-parameters and their relative
ordering does not transfer across tasks, indicating the necessity of re-tuning
them for each task for best performance. On the other hand, the best
hyper-parameter configuration from one task may often result in effective
learning on held-out tasks even with different robots, providing a reasonable
default. We make the benchmark tasks publicly available to enhance
reproducibility in real-world reinforcement learning.

because of the well-recognized bias at the boundaries of the interval.
Motivated by an application in cancer research, we consider a boundary
constraint linking the values of the unknown target density function at the
boundaries. We provide a kernel density estimator (KDE) that successfully
incorporates this linked boundary condition, leading to a non-self-adjoint
diffusion process and expansions in non-separable generalized eigenfunctions.
The solution is rigorously analyzed through an integral representation given by
the unified transform (or Fokas method). The new KDE possesses many desirable
properties, such as consistency, asymptotically negligible bias at the
boundaries, and an increased rate of approximation, as measured by the AMISE.
We apply our method to the motivating example in biology and provide numerical
experiments with synthetic data, including comparisons with state-of-the-art
KDEs (which currently cannot handle linked boundary constraints). Results
suggest that the new method is fast and accurate. Furthermore, we demonstrate
how to build statistical estimators of the boundary conditions satisfied by the
target function without apriori knowledge. Our analysis can also be extended to
more general boundary conditions that may be encountered in applications.

Minor typos corrected",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding classical canonical observables consists of taking a function space
over phase space. For constrained theories, these functions must form zero
brackets with a closed algebraic structure of first-class constraints. This
brackets condition can moreover be recast as a first-order PDE system, to be
treated as a free characteristic problem. We explore explicit observables
equations and their concrete solutions for a translation- and
reparametrization-invariant action, thereby populating the following variety of
notions of observables with examples. 1) The brackets can be strongly or weakly
zero in Dirac's sense, i.e.\ a linear combination of constraints. 2)
Observables can admit pure-configuration and pure-momentum restrictions. 3) Our
model provides the translation constraint P$_i$ encoding zero total momentum of
the model universe and depending homogeneous-linearly on momenta, and the
Chronos constraint equation of time reinterpretation of the `constant-energy
condition' and depending quadratically on momenta. These are mechanical
analogues of GR's momentum M$_i$ and Hamiltonian H constraints respectively.
P$_i$ and Chronos moreover algebraically close separately (only M$_i$ does for
GR). Our model thus supports translation gauge-observables $G$ and Chronos
observables $C$, as well as unrestricted observables $U$ and Dirac observables
$D$ brackets-commuting with neither and both respectively. We relate the strong
to properly-weak split of weak observables to the complementary-function to
particular-integral split of the complete solution, with the properly-weak
rendered of measure-0 relative to the strong by the latter's free
characteristicness. The closed algebraic structures form a bounded lattice and
the corresponding notions of observables a dual lattice, with the observables
themselves forming a presheaf of function spaces thereover.

measured current densities were found to be three to four orders of magnitude
higher than that observed with the conventional polymer-based triboelectric
nanogenerators (TENGs). The electromotive force for the tribo-tunneling
transport comes from the dynamic electronic excitation at the frictional
interface rather than from the electrostatically trapped surface charges as in
the case of conventional TENGs. The strong electronic excitation can give rise
to a non-equilibrium interfacial charge variation. Depending on the energy
distribution of the excited electrons/holes, the charge variation subsequently
dissipates non-adiabatically into tunneling current and trapped surface
charges, or adiabatically into heat. These fundamental results not only enhance
our understanding of the triboelectric phenomenon, but also open up new paths

While dramatic progress in the prior two decades has enabled large-scale SLAM,
the majority of existing methods rely on non-linear optimization techniques to
find the MLE of the robot trajectory and surrounding environment. These methods
are prone to local minima and are thus sensitive to initialization. Several
recent papers have developed optimization algorithms for the Pose-Graph SLAM
problem that can certify the optimality of a computed solution. Though this
does not guarantee a priori that this approach generates an optimal solution, a
recent extension has shown that when the noise lies within a critical threshold
that the solution to the optimization algorithm is guaranteed to be optimal. To
address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper illustrates that the
Pose-Graph SLAM and Landmark SLAM can be formulated as polynomial optimization
programs that are SOS convex. This paper then describes how the Pose-Graph and
Landmark SLAM problems can be solved to a global minimum without initialization
regardless of noise level using the Sparse-BSOS hierarchy. This paper also
empirically illustrates that convergence happens at the second step in this
hierarchy. In addition, this paper illustrates how this Sparse-BSOS hierarchy
can be implemented in the complex domain and empirically shows that convergence
happens also at the second step of this complex domain hierarchy. Finally, the
superior performance of the proposed approach when compared to existing SLAM

However, practical use of differential privacy still lags behind research
progress because research prototypes cannot satisfy the scalability
requirements of production deployments. To address this challenge, we present
Chorus, a framework for building scalable differential privacy mechanisms which
is based on cooperation between the mechanism itself and a high-performance
production database management system (DBMS). We demonstrate the use of Chorus
to build the first highly scalable implementations of complex mechanisms like
Weighted PINQ, MWEM, and the matrix mechanism. We report on our experience
deploying Chorus at Uber, and evaluate its scalability on real-world queries.

probabilities on the different classes. We propose a robust, non-parametric
method of calibrating probabilities called SplineCalib that utilizes smoothing
splines to determine a calibration function. We demonstrate how applying
certain transformations as part of the calibration process can improve
performance on problems in deep learning and other domains where the scores
tend to be ""overconfident"". We adapt the approach to multi-class problems and
find that better calibration can improve accuracy as well as log-loss by better
resolving uncertain cases. Finally, we present a cross-validated approach to
calibration which conserves data. Significant improvements to log-loss and
accuracy are shown on several different problems. We also introduce the
ml-insights python package which contains an implementation of the SplineCalib
algorithm.

irreducible tensor models with $\mathrm{O}(N)$ symmetry, the fermionic
tetrahedral interaction does not vanish and can therefore support a melonic
large $N$ limit. The strongly-coupled regime has a very analogous structure as
in the complex SYK model or in
$\mathrm{U}(N)\times\mathrm{O}(N)\times\mathrm{U}(N)$ tensor quantum mechanics,
the main difference being that the states are now singlets under
$\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We introduce character formulas that enumerate such singlets
as a function of $N$, and compute their first values. We conclude with an
explicit numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in two simple examples:
the symmetric model at $N=1$, and the antisymmetric traceless model at $N=3$.

that the rank of the Mordell--Weil group $E_d(K)$ is unbounded as $d$ varies.
The curve $E_d$ satisfies the BSD conjecture, so that its rank equals the order

systematic, independent of specific Hamiltonians, and generalizes to higher

arbitrary lattice fermion theories can always be simply defined as topological
gauge fields whose gauge group is the fermion number parity. This definition
agrees with other expected properties of spin structures, and it motivates the
introduction of ""paraspin structures"" that serve the same role in parafermion

Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope. We aim to
measure the brightness profiles, kinematics, and stellar population properties
of the peculiar kinematic structures in these galaxies and shed light on their
true nature and formation mechanism.
  Methods. We use a kinematic decomposition technique to separate the
individual contributions to the spectra of the two distinct kinematic
components observed at each spatial position in the field of view. By folding
back the outcome of a photometric decomposition we reduce the intrinsic
degeneracies in recovering the kinematics and the best-fitting stellar spectral
templates. Finally, by extracting the Lick line-strength indices for the
individual components and fitting them to single stellar population models we
derive their ages, metallicities, and {\alpha}/Fe overabundances.
  Results. The two kinematically decoupled stellar components in NGC 448 have
similar ages, but different chemical compositions. The distinct kinematic
feature in NGC 448 has a nearly exponential surface-brightness light profile,
dominates in the innermost ~ 10"", is smaller in size, and is very likely an
embedded counter-rotating disk as also indicated by its kinematics. It has
higher metallicity than the main galaxy stellar body and lower {\alpha}/Fe
overabundance. By contrast, we do not find evidence for true decoupling in the
two distinct kinematic components in NGC 4365. This confirms earlier work
suggesting that the kinematically distinct core is likely not a separate
dynamical structure, but most certainly likely a projection effect stemming
from the orbital structure of this galaxy that was previously found to be
intrinsically triaxial in shape.

systems, where the tertiary binary excites large eccentricity in the BH binary
through Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations, causing the binary BHs to merge via
gravitational radiation. For typical BH binaries with masses $m_{1,2}\simeq
20M_\odot-30M_\odot$ and initial semimajor axis $a_0\sim100$ AU (such that the
binaries have no chance of merging by themselves within $\sim10^{10}$ yrs), we
show that binary-binary interactions can significantly increase the LK window
for mergers (the range of companion inclinations that allows the BH binary to
merge within 10~Gyrs). This increase arises from a secular resonance between
the LK oscillation of the BH binary and the nodal precession of the outer
(binary-binary) orbit driven by the tertiary binary. Therefore, in the presence
of tertiary binary, the BH merger fraction is increased to $10-30\%$, an order
of magnitude larger than the merger fraction found in similar triple systems.
Our analysis (with appropriate scalings) can be easily adapted to other
configurations of systems, such as relatively compact BH binaries and
moderately hierarchical triples, which may generate even higher merger
fractions. Since the occurrence rate of stellar quadruples in the galactic
fields is not much smaller than that of stellar triples, our result suggests
that dynamically induced BH mergers in quadruple systems may be an important
channel of producing BH mergers observed by LIGO/VIRGO.

$U(1)_d$ remnant of the underlying spacetime geometry or a unified theory may
survive down to small mass scales $\sim 1$ GeV, connecting low energy Standard

direct detection of Planck scale DM can be achieved through the $U(1)_d$
interactions of DM with SM quarks. Low energy intense sources may uncover the
GeV scale messengers of Planckian physics, allowing for testable predictions.
We assume that $U(1)_d$ is gauged baryon number, which implies several new
electroweak charged particles are expected to arise near the weak scale to
cancel gauge anomalies. The model generically gives rise to kinetic mixing
between the $U(1)_d$ gauge boson and the photon, which may be measurable. In
this scenario, direct detection of DM and measurements of a low energy

interconverted at the asymptotically optimal rate with negligible error, even

mass densities, which are thought to arise as a consequence of isothermal,
supersonic turbulence. Star formation is then widely assumed to occur in
perturbations in which gravitational collapse is faster than the rate of change
due to turbulent motions. Here we use direct numerical simulations to measure
this rate as a function of density for a range of turbulent Mach numbers, and
show it is faster at high densities than at low densities. Furthermore, we show
that both the density PDF and rate of change arise naturally in a simple model
of turbulence as a continuous Markov process. The one-dimensional Langevin
equation that describes this evolution depends on only two parameters, yet it
captures the full evolution seen in direct three-dimensional simulations. If it
is modified to include gravity, the Langevin equation also reproduces the rate
of material collapsing to high densities seen in turbulent simulations
including self-gravity. When generalized to include both temperature and
density, similar analyses are likely applicable throughout astrophysics.

hampered by the short range of natural spin-spin interactions. Here, we propose
a scheme to entangle distant spin qubits via the soft modes of an
antiferromagnetic domain wall (DW). As spin qubits, we focus on quantum
impurities (QI's) placed in the vicinity of an insulating antiferromagnetic
thin film. The low-energy modes harbored by the DW are embedded in the
antiferromagnetic bulk, whose intrinsic spin-wave dynamics have a gap that can
exceed the THz range. By setting the QI frequency and the temperature well
within the bulk gap, we focus on the dipolar interaction between the QI and two
soft modes localized at the DW. One is a string-like mode associated with
transverse displacements of the DW position, while the dynamics of the other,
corresponding to planar rotations of the Neel order parameter, constitute a
spin superfluid. By choosing the geometry in which the QI does not couple to
the string mode, we use an external magnetic field to control the gap of the
spin superfluid and the qubit-qubit coupling it engenders. We suggest that a
tunable micron-range coherent coupling between qubits can be established using
common antiferromagnetic materials.

presents aspects that are absent in four dimensions, one of the most remarkable
being the existence of stably trapped null geodesics in the exterior of
asymptotically flat black holes. This paper investigates the stable trapping
phenomenon for two families of higher dimensional black holes, namely black
strings and black rings, and how this trapping structure is responsible for the
slow decay of linear waves on their exterior. More precisely, we study decay
properties for the energy of solutions to the scalar, linear wave equation
$\Box_{g_{\textup{ring}}} \Psi=0$, where $g_{\textup{ring}}$ is the metric of a
fixed black ring solution to the five-dimensional Einstein vacuum equations.
For a class $\mathfrak{g}$ of black ring metrics, we prove a logarithmic lower
bound for the uniform energy decay rate on the black ring exterior
$(\mathcal{D},g_{\textup{ring}})$, with $g_{\textup{ring}}\in\mathfrak{g}$. The
proof generalizes the perturbation argument and quasimode construction of
Holzegel--Smulevici \cite{SharpLogHolz} to the case of a non-separable wave
equation and crucially relies on the presence of stably trapped null geodesics
on $\mathcal{D}$. As a by-product, the same logarithmic lower bound can be
established for any five-dimensional black string.
  Our result is the first mathematically rigorous statement supporting the
expectation that black rings are dynamically unstable to generic perturbations.
In particular, we conjecture a new \textit{nonlinear} instability for
five-dimensional black strings and thin black rings which is already present at
the level of scalar perturbations and clearly differs from the mechanism driven
by the well-known Gregory--Laflamme instability.

uniformly covers a region of 25 square degrees centered on the galaxy to a
depth of g ~ 23.5. We use this data to study the structural properties of
Fornax, overall stellar population, and its member stars in different
evolutionary phases. We also search for possible signs of tidal disturbance.
Fornax is found to be significantly more spatially extended than what early
studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal
disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of ~32.1
mag/arcsec^2. However, there are hints of shell-like features located ~30' -
40' from the center of Fornax that may be stellar debris from past merger
events. We also find that intermediate age and young main-sequence populations
show different orientation at the galaxy center and have many substructures.
The deep DES Y3 data allows us to characterize the age of those substructures
with great accuracy, both those previously known and those newly discovered in
this work, on the basis of their color-magnitude diagram morphology. We find
that the youngest overdensities are all found on the Eastern side of Fornax,
where the Fornax field population itself is slightly younger than in the West.
The high quality DES Y3 data reveals that Fornax has many rich structures, and
provides insights into its complex formation history.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm by Natarajan and Tadepalli (2005), are

changes and high-dimensional inputs by proposing a multi-objective Q-network

nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Yet, there is no clear consensus on their physical
driving mechanism(s). We have previously shown that AGN radiative feedback,
driven by radiation pressure on dust, can account for the observed dynamics and
energetics of galactic outflows, provided that radiation trapping is taken into
account. Here we generalise our model results by explicitly considering the
temporal evolution of the central AGN luminosity, and the shell mass evolution
in different ambient density distributions. In the case of fixed-mass shells,
the high observed values of the momentum ratio ($\zeta = \dot{p}/(L/c)$) and
energy ratio ($\epsilon_k = \dot{E}_{k}/L$) may be attributed to either
radiation trapping or AGN luminosity decay. In contrast, for expanding shells
sweeping up mass from the surrounding environment, a decay in AGN luminosity
cannot account for the observed high energetics, and radiation trapping is
necessarily required. Indeed, strong radiation trapping, e.g. due to high
dust-to-gas ratios, can considerably boost the outflow energetics. We obtain a
distinct radial dependence for the outflow energetics ($\zeta(r)$,
$\epsilon_k(r)$) in the case of radiation trapping and luminosity decay, which
may help discriminate between the two scenarios. In this framework, the
recently discovered `fossil' outflows, with anomalously high values of the
energetics, may be interpreted as relics of past AGN activity. The observed
outflow properties may therefore provide useful constraints on the past history
of AGN activity and/or the physical conditions of the outflow launch region.

evaluating the behavior of predictive models in light of those shifts is an

new phase in fully 2D, single layer NdNiO$_3$, in which all signatures of the

show that the derived perceptual saliencies are in accordance with a previously

$\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$, although there is a substantial increase in scatter
towards low masses. In particular, three well-studied ultra diffuse galaxies,
with dwarf-like stellar masses, reveal a wide range in their GC-to-halo mass
ratios. We compare our GC system--halo mass relation to the recent model of El
Badry et al., finding that their fiducial model does not reproduce our data in
the low mass regime. This may suggest that GC formation needs to be more
efficient than assumed in their model, or it may be due to the onset of
stochastic GC occupation in low mass halos. Finally, we briefly discuss the
stellar mass-halo mass relation for our low mass galaxies with GCs, and we
suggest some nearby dwarf galaxies for which searches for GCs may be fruitful.

evaluate their effectiveness in further separating whisper from normal speech.
A benchmarking of these features using multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and LSTMs
suggests that the proposed features, in combination with LFBE features, can
help us further improve our classifiers. We prove that, with enough data, the
LSTM model is indeed as capable of learning whisper characteristics from LFBE

Here, we investigate the influence of noise and disorder on the efficiency of
excitation energy transfer (EET) in a linear harmonic chain of $N=5$ sites with

yield derived, complex elements. Syntactic structure is thus seen as the result
or discrete recursive combinatorics over lexical items which get assembled into
phrases, which are themselves combined to form sentences. This view is common
to European and American structuralism (e.g., Benveniste, 1971; Hockett, 1958)
and different incarnations of generative grammar, transformational and
non-transformational (Chomsky, 1956, 1995; and Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982; Gazdar,

the fact that syntactic operations must apply somewhere, particularly when
copying and movement operations are considered. Contemporary syntactic theory
has thus somewhat acknowledged the importance of formalizing aspects of the
spaces in which elements are manipulated, but it is still a vastly
underexplored area. In this paper we explore the consequences of
conceptualizing syntax as a set of topological operations applying over spaces
rather than over discrete elements. We argue that there are empirical
advantages in such a view for the treatment of long-distance dependencies and
cross-derivational dependencies: constraints on possible configurations emerge
from the dynamics of the system.

using a tilt-rotor UAV. The main challenge in controlling this kind of system
arises from the dynamic behavior imposed by the load, which is usually coupled
to the UAV by means of a rope, adding unactuated degrees of freedom to the
whole system. Furthermore, to perform the load transportation it is often
needed the knowledge of the load position to accomplish the task. Since
available sensors are commonly embedded in the mobile platform, information on
the load position may not be directly available. To solve this problem in this
work, initially, the kinematics of the multi-body mechanical system are
formulated from the load's perspective, from which a detailed dynamic model is
derived using the Euler-Lagrange approach, yielding a highly coupled, nonlinear
state-space representation of the system, affine in the inputs, with the load's
position and orientation directly represented by state variables. A zonotopic
state estimator is proposed to solve the problem of estimating the load
position and orientation, which is formulated based on sensors located at the
aircraft, with different sampling times, and unknown-but-bounded measurement
noise. To solve the path tracking problem, a discrete-time mixed
$\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ controller with pole-placement constraints
is designed with guaranteed time-response properties and robust to unmodeled
dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances. Results from
numerical experiments, performed in a platform based on the Gazebo simulator
and on a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the system, are presented to
corroborate the performance of the zonotopic state estimator along with the
designed controller.

for thermoelectric applications. Many known crystalline materials with low
thermal conductivity, including PbTe and Bi2Te3, possess a special kind of
chemical bond called ""resonant bond"". Resonant bonds consist of superposition
of degenerate bonding configurations that leads to structural instability,
anomalous long-range interatomic interaction and soft optical phonons. These
factors contribute to large lattice anharmonicity and strong phonon-phonon
scattering, which result in low thermal conductivity. In this work, we use
first-principles simulation to investigate the effect of resonant bonding in
two dimensions (2D), where resonant bonds are in proximity to the surface. We
find that the long-range interatomic interaction due to resonant bonding
becomes more prominent in 2D due to reduced screening of the
atomic-displacement-induced charge density distortion. To demonstrate this
effect, we analyze the phonon properties of quasi-2D Bi2PbTe4 with an ultralow
thermal conductivity of 0.74 W/mK at 300K. By comparing the interatomic force
constants of quasi-2D Bi2PbTe4 and its bulk counterpart, and the properties of
resonant bonds near the surface and in the bulk, we conclude that resonant
bonds are significantly enhanced in reduced dimensions and are more effective
in reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our results will provide new
clues to searching for thermal insulators in low-dimensional materials.

approaches for controlling robotic systems typically rely heavily on accurately
estimating the full state of the robot (e.g., a running robot might estimate
joint angles and velocities, torso state, and position relative to a goal).
However, full state representations are often excessively rich for the specific
task at hand and can lead to significant computational inefficiency and
brittleness to errors in state estimation. In contrast, we present an approach
that eschews such rich representations and seeks to create task-driven
representations. The key technical insight is to leverage the theory of
information bottlenecks}to formalize the notion of a ""task-driven

minimality of a representation. We propose novel iterative algorithms for
automatically synthesizing (offline) a task-driven representation (given in
terms of a set of task-relevant variables (TRVs)) and a performant control
policy that is a function of the TRVs. We present online algorithms for
estimating the TRVs in order to apply the control policy. We demonstrate that
our approach results in significant robustness to unmodeled measurement

wave and forecast its appearance by 1~s. Looking ahead, widening this
forecasting window beyond 1~s will enable new computer vision technologies for
real-time risk-assessment of emergent human collective motion.

capable of long term autonomy alongside people. Thus, a recent line of research
has studied the problem of teaching autonomous agents the concept of ethics and
human social norms. Most existing work considers the case of an individual
agent attempting to learn a predefined set of rules. In reality, however,
social norms are not always pre-defined and are very difficult to represent
algorithmically. Moreover, the basic idea behind the social norms concept is
ensuring that one's actions do not negatively influence others' utilities,
which is inherently a multiagent concept. Thus, here we investigate a way to
teach agents, as a team, how to act according to human social norms. In this
research, we introduce the STAR framework used to teach an ad hoc team of
agents to act in accordance with human social norms. Using a hybrid team
(agents and people), when taking an action considered to be socially
unacceptable, the agents receive negative feedback from the human teammate(s)
who has(have) an awareness of the team's norms. We view STAR as an important
step towards teaching agents to act more consistently with respect to human
morality.

flexibility offered by aProbLog in handling complex relational domains. Our
motivation is that faithfully capturing the distribution of probabilities is
necessary to compute an expected utility for effective decision making under
uncertainty: unfortunately, these probability distributions can be highly
uncertain due to sparse data. To understand and accurately manipulate such
probability distributions we need a well-defined theoretical framework that is
provided by the Beta distribution, which specifies a distribution of
probabilities representing all the possible values of a probability when the
exact value is unknown.

oblique items such as PPs. We propose two PP argumenthood prediction tasks

classification of PPs in VerbNet, and (2) gradient argumenthood prediction
using human judgments as gold standard, and report results from prediction
models that use pretrained word embeddings and other linguistically informed

The strategy is based on the bounding condition each constraint produces on

function value, we formulate linear equations system leading to the

the inversion of a matrix sized by the number of dimensions of the problem.
Therefore, the algorithm's complexity is comparable to the corresponding to the

the importance of a realistic hydrodynamic evolution constrained by bulk hadron

heavy-flavor hadron spectra and extracting heavy-quark drag coefficient. The
transverse transport coefficient is less constrained due to the influence of
the underlying mechanism for heavy-quark medium interaction. Additional

a gradient representing the direction of the next best view. The method is
demonstrated within simulation and on a real robotic platform containing a
custom 3D camera array for the challenging scenario of robotic harvesting in a
highly occluded and unstructured environment. It was shown on a real robotic
platform that by moving the end effector using the gradient of an objective
function leads to a locally optimal view of the object of interest, even

increase in target size by 29.3% compared to a baseline method using a single
RGB-D camera, which obtained 9.17%. The results demonstrate qualitatively and
quantitatively that the 3DMTS method performed better in most scenarios, and
yielded three times the target size compared to the baseline method. The
increased target size in the final view will improve the detection of key
features of the object of interest for further manipulation, such as grasping

The event light curve is characterized by a brief ($\sim 3$ days) anomaly near
the peak produced by minor-image perturbations. From modeling, we find two
distinct solutions that describe the observed light curve almost equally well.
From the investigation of the lens-system configurations, we find that the
confusion in the lensing solution is caused by the degeneracy between the two
solutions resulting from the source passages on different sides of the
planetary caustic. These degeneracies can be severe for major-image
perturbations but it is known that they are considerably less severe for
minor-image perturbations. From the comparison of the lens-system configuration
with those of two previously discovered planetary events, for which similar
degeneracies were reported, we find that the degeneracies are caused by the
special source trajectories that passed the star-planet axes at approximately
right angles. By conducting a Bayesian analysis, it is estimated that the lens
is a planetary system in which a giant planet with a mass $M_{\rm
p}=0.62^{+1.16}_{-0.33}~M_{\rm J}$ ($0.65^{+1.21}_{-0.35}~M_{\rm J}$) is
orbiting a low-mass M-dwarf host with a mass $M_{\rm

parentheses represent the masses for the individual degenerate solutions. The
projected host-planet separations are $a_\perp\sim 0.95$ au and $\sim 1.05$ au

similar degeneracies in future analyses of planetary lensing events with
minor-image perturbations.

$\mathbf{H}_a = H_{ay}\hat{y}+H_{az}\hat{z}$, because the instability field
$\mathbf{H}_{fi}$ is closely related with a flux jump occurrence. At the
critical-state model framework, once the Lorentz $\mathbf{F}_L$ and pinning
forces $\mathbf{F}_P$ are at equilibrium, the current density reaches a
critical value $j_c$ and a stationary magnetic induction distribution
$\mathbf{B}$ is established. The equilibrium of forces is analytically solved
considering that the pinning force is mainly affected by temperature
increments; the energy dissipation is incorporated throughout the heat equation
at the adiabatic regime. The theory is able to obtain the instability field
according to the thermal bath and applied field values; moreover, it provides
of instability field branches comprising both partial and full penetrates
states. With this information is possible to construct a field-temperature map.
The results are compared with already published experimental data, finding a
qualitatively agreement between them. This theoretical study works with a first
order perturbation, then the perturbation presents a periodical behavior along
the thickness direction; considering this environment it is constructed the
magnetic induction distributions which resemble flexible cantilever structures.

molecular outflows. The correlations of MO velocity and $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$
with AGN luminosities are found to be stronger compared to those with the
starburst luminosities. We conclude that both starbursts and AGN play crucial
role in driving the large scale MO.

because of this interaction strong longitudinal gluon fields, namely the
Glasma, are produced immediately after the collision. Besides, heavy quarks are
also produced in the very early stage and because of their large mass and small
concentration, their motion does not affect the evolution of the Glasma, thus
behaving as ideal probes of the Glasma itself. We study the evolution of the

solving consistently the equations of motion of the quarks in the evolving

Adaptive O-CNN encoder takes the planar patch normal and displacement as input
and performs 3D convolutions only at the octants at each level, while the
Adaptive O-CNN decoder infers the shape occupancy and subdivision status of
octants at each level and estimates the best plane normal and displacement for
each leaf octant. As a general framework for 3D shape analysis and generation,
the Adaptive O-CNN not only reduces the memory and computational cost, but also
offers better shape generation capability than the existing 3D-CNN approaches.
We validate Adaptive O-CNN in terms of efficiency and effectiveness on
different shape analysis and generation tasks, including shape classification,
3D autoencoding, shape prediction from a single image, and shape completion for

fully magnetized, the contrary is the case. Their balance tremendously distorts
the jet density and electromagnetic fields, leading to enormous energy exchange
between different species and fields. As a result, the electron spectrum energy

  2018",,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud storage is a widely utilized service for both personal and enterprise
demands. However, despite its advantages, many potential users with enormous
amounts of sensitive data (big data) refrain from fully utilizing the cloud
storage service due to valid concerns about data privacy. An established
solution to the cloud data privacy problem is to perform encryption on the
client-end. This approach, however, restricts data processing capabilities (eg,
searching over the data). Accordingly, the research problem we investigate is
how to enable real-time searching over the encrypted big data in the cloud. In
particular, semantic search is of interest to clients dealing with big data. To
address this problem, in this research, we develop a system (termed S3BD) for
searching big data using cloud services without exposing any data to cloud
providers. To keep real-time response on big data, S3BD proactively prunes the
search space to a subset of the whole dataset. For that purpose, we propose a
method to cluster the encrypted data. An abstract of each cluster is maintained
on the client-end to navigate the search operation to appropriate clusters at
the search time. Results of experiments, carried out on real-world big
datasets, demonstrate that the search operation can be achieved in real-time
and is significantly more efficient than other counterparts. In addition, a
fully functional prototype of S3BD is made publicly available.

trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of
trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance
attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty
associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data
integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk
attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference
model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that
quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices in the presence
of an adversaries who manipulate the data. We consider an imperfect anomaly
monitoring mechanism that monitors the data being sent from each device and
classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred.
These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian
inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a
utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use a prospect theory
inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate the
trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. Furthermore, we
also model the system using the traditionally used expected utility theory and
compare the results with that obtained using prospect theory. As decisions are
based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models: one optimistic
and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive
simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety
of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.

decades. This interest has mainly been driven by the intelligence of dolphins
and other odontocetes. However the semantic content of odontocete USV and its
mechanism of production remain poorly understood. Serendipitously however many
rodent species have convergently evolved the ability to produce USVs in a
similar manner. In this paper we use rodent USV as a model process to help us
gain insight into the production mechanism for mammalian USV as a whole. We
derive a model that describes the production of rodent USVs by considering the
interaction of an unstable jet, emerging from the vocal folds, with the passive
resonance modes of the upper vocal tract. Thus our model is also a solution to
a special case of the jet susceptibility problem. The derived model takes the
form of a set of coupled nonlinear time domain ODEs, whose solutions are
controlled by biologically relevant parameters such as subglottal pressure and
vocal fold radius. In our analysis of the model we find the existence of a
subglottal blowing pressure threshold ($p \approx 710$ Pa), above which steady
acoustic oscillations occur. Furthermore we also reproduce the $22$ kHz rat
alarm call at realistic blowing pressures ($p \approx 1500$ Pa)

um and [Si I] 1.645 um lines, and our `deep [Fe II]+[Si I] image' provides an
unprecedented panoramic view of Cas A, showing both shocked and unshocked SN
ejecta together with shocked circumstellar medium at subarcsec (~0.7 arcsec or
0.012 pc) resolution. The diffuse emission from the unshocked SN ejecta has a
form of clumps, filaments, and arcs, and their spatial distribution correlates
well with that of the Spitzer [Si II] infrared emission, suggesting that the
emission is likely due to [Si I] line not [Fe II] line as in shocked material.
The structure of the optically-invisible western area of Cas A is clearly seen
for the first time. The area is filled with many Quasi-Stationary Flocculi
(QSFs) and fragments of the disrupted ejecta shell. We suggest that the
anomalous radio properties in this area could be due to the increased number of
such dense clumps. We identified 309 knots in the deep [Fe II]+[Si I] image and
classified them into QSFs and fast-moving knots (FMKs). The total H+He mass of
QSFs is ~0.23 Msun, implying that the mass fraction of dense clumps in the
progenitor's red-supergiant wind is 4--13%. The spatial distribution of QSFs
suggests that there had been a highly asymmetric mass loss $10^4$--$10^5$ yr
before the SN explosion. The mass of the [Fe II] line-emitting, shocked dense
Fe ejecta is ~3x$10^{-5}$ Msun. The comparison with the ionic S-line dominated
Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR image suggests that the outermost FMKs in the
southeastern area are Fe-rich.

fractional order varies spatially. We develop efficient numerical methods
capable of solving this challenging problem on domains ranging from simple
one-dimensional intervals with uniform meshes, through to full
three-dimensional geometries on unstructured meshes. Results are presented for
several test problems in one dimension, demonstrating the effects of different
fractional orders in regions of healthy and damaged tissue. Then we showcase
some new results for a three-dimensional fractional monodomain equation with a
Beeler-Reuter ionic current model on a rabbit heart mesh. These simulation
results are found to exhibit wave re-entry behaviour, brought about only by
varying the value of the fractional order in a region representing damaged

robotics technology has made robotic 3D Printing of concrete a promising
technique for in-situ construction. Yet, scalability remains an important
hurdle to widespread adoption: the printing systems (gantry- based or
arm-based) are often much larger than the structure to be printed, hence
cumbersome. Recently, a mobile printing system - a manipulator mounted on a
mobile base - was proposed to alleviate this issue: such a system, by moving
its base, can potentially print a structure larger than itself. However, the
proposed system could only print while being stationary, imposing thereby a
limit on the size of structures that can be printed in a single take. Here, we
develop a system that implements the printing-while-moving paradigm, which
enables printing single-piece structures of arbitrary sizes with a single
robot. This development requires solving motion planning, localization, and
motion control problems that are specific to mobile 3D Printing. We report our

upsampled to obtain a set of dense 2D images encoding spatial information.
Several fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) are then trained to carry
out road detection, either by using data from a single sensor, or by using
three fusion strategies: early, late, and the newly proposed cross fusion.
Whereas in the former two fusion approaches, the integration of multimodal
information is carried out at a predefined depth level, the cross fusion FCN is
designed to directly learn from data where to integrate information; this is
accomplished by using trainable cross connections between the LIDAR and the
camera processing branches.
  To further highlight the benefits of using a multimodal system for road
detection, a data set consisting of visually challenging scenes was extracted
from driving sequences of the KITTI raw data set. It was then demonstrated
that, as expected, a purely camera-based FCN severely underperforms on this
data set. A multimodal system, on the other hand, is still able to provide high
accuracy. Finally, the proposed cross fusion FCN was evaluated on the KITTI

  productions in Japan: a study using a sparse high-dimensional model",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There have been several scientific studies concerning the interconnectedness
between land-surface conditions (e.g., vegetation, land use, and socioeconomic
activities) and marine ecosystems (e.g., biodiversity, primary production, and
seafood production). This idea of the land-sea connectivity sounded reasonable
for many scientists because there is an obvious connection by rivers, however,
quantitative estimation of this relationship has been thought to be difficult
due to the size of the target areas, the numbers of possible variables, and the
amount of noises in this complex system. In this study, we applied a sparse
high-dimensional modeling to overcome these difficulties and found several
significant land-sea linkages. In this modeling, the key is the penalization in
the number of independent variables, and thus a limited number of significant
independent variables are chosen in an objective and quantitative manner. We
selected 448 independent variables (geological, biological, and social) and 68
dependent variables (marine products) from a governmental database. Then we
summarized the data according to the political boundaries of 47 prefectures.
The sparse high-dimensional model we constructed successfully highlighted
several significant variables to estimate the amount of marine products by
prefecture. For example, we found that coastal, especially sessile marine
products such as seaweed and shellfish had more explanatory variables than
open-water marine products such as tuna and sailfishes. In addition, salmon
production had a strong connection to the mesoscale (prefecture-level)
land-surface conditions possibly due to their interconnected life cycle between
freshwater rivers and the sea. We believe that the sparse modeling is an
effective statistical tool to explain relationships in a complex system such as
land-sea connections.

contemporary condensed matter physics. Here, I would like to provide a
pedagogical review explaining some of the main ideas, which were pivotal in
establishing topological matter as such an important subject. Specifically, I
explain how the integer quantum Hall state played the role as a prototype for
topological insulator, eventually leading to the concept of topological matter
in general. The topological nature of the integer quantum Hall state is best
represented by the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs, or so-called TKNN
formula, which connects between the Berry phase and the Hall conductivity. The
topological non-triviality of topological insulator stems from the existence of
a Dirac monopole in an appropriate, but often hidden Hamiltonian parameter
space. Interestingly, having the identical Dirac monopole structure, the
Hamiltonian describing the Rabi oscillation bears the essence of topological
insulator. The concept of topological matter has expanded to include
topological semimetals such as Weyl and Dirac semimetals. A final frontier in
the research of topological matter is the interaction-induced topological
phases of matter, namely, the fractional Chern and topological insulators. The
existence of the fractional Chern and topological insulators has been proposed
theoretically by drawing an analogy from the fractional quantum Hall states.
The gist of this proposal is explained along with some of its issues. I
conclude this review by discussing some of the future directions in the
research of topological matter.

tasks in biomedical text mining. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have
been applied to biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) and showed
promising results. However, as deep learning approaches need an abundant amount
of training data, a lack of data can hinder performance. BioNER datasets are
scarce resources and each dataset covers only a small subset of entity types.
Furthermore, many bio entities are polysemous, which is one of the major
obstacles in named entity recognition. Results: To address the lack of data and
the entity type misclassification problem, we propose CollaboNet which utilizes
a combination of multiple NER models. In CollaboNet, models trained on a
different dataset are connected to each other so that a target model obtains
information from other collaborator models to reduce false positives. Every
model is an expert on their target entity type and takes turns serving as a
target and a collaborator model during training time. The experimental results
show that CollaboNet can be used to greatly reduce the number of false
positives and misclassified entities including polysemous words. CollaboNet
achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision, recall and F1
score. Conclusions: We demonstrated the benefits of combining multiple models
for BioNER. Our model has successfully reduced the number of misclassified
entities and improved the performance by leveraging multiple datasets annotated
for different entity types. Given the state-of-the-art performance of our
model, we believe that CollaboNet can improve the accuracy of downstream
biomedical text mining applications such as bio-entity relation extraction.

fine-grained target data are modeled by another Gaussian process that considers
both the spatial correlation and the auxiliary data sets with their
uncertainty. We integrate the Gaussian process with a spatial aggregation
process that transforms the fine-grained target data into the coarse-grained
target data, by which we can infer the fine-grained target Gaussian process
from the coarse-grained data. Our model is designed such that the inference of

the variables of fine-grained target and auxiliary data are analytically
integrated out. Our experiments on real-world spatial data sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model.

Eu, Gd, and Dy. Using high-resolution FEROS, HARPS, and UVES spectra from the

thanks to the automatic optimization pipeline GAUGUIN. We present abundances of
Ba (5057 stars), Eu (6268 stars), Gd (5431 stars), and Dy (5479 stars). We
chemically characterize the thin and the thick discs, and a metal-rich
alpha-rich population. We find that the [Eu/Fe] ratio follows a continuous
sequence from the thin disc to the thick disc as a function of the metallicity.
In thick disc stars, the [Eu/Ba] ratio is found to be constant, while the
[Gd/Ba] and [Dy/Ba] ratios decrease as a function of the metallicity. These
observations clearly indicate a different nucleosynthesis history in the thick
disc between Eu and Gd-Dy. We also find that the alpha-rich metal-rich stars
are also enriched in r-process elements (like thick disc stars), but their
[Ba/Fe] is very different from thick disc stars. Finally, we find that the
[r/\alpha] ratio tends to decrease with metallicity, indicating that supernovae
of different properties probably contribute differently to the synthesis of
r-process elements and \alpha-elements. We provide average abundance trends for
[Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] with rather small dispersions, and for the first time for
[Gd/Fe] and [Dy/Fe]. This data may help to constrain chemical evolution models
of Milky Way r- and s-process elements and the yields of massive stars.
Including yields of neutron-star or black hole mergers is now crucial if we

observed scales. More precisely, after the first eruption, an FD approximately
equal to 2% and almost no GMS occurred because the Bz magnetic field component
in front of the corresponding interplanetary CME (ICME) was northern. The
stronger second eruption produced somewhat larger composite disturbances (FD ~
9.3% and GMS with indexes Dst ~ -144 nT, Ap ~ 235) than expected (FD ~ 4.4%,
Dst ~ -135 nT, Ap ~ 125) because the second ICME overtook the trailing part of
the first ICME near Earth, and the resulting Bz component was more intense and
southern. Both ICMEs arrived at Earth earlier than expected because they
propagated in the high-speed solar wind emanated from an extended coronal hole

(AGB) stars were observed in the CO J = (2-1) line. Detections were made
towards objects that have evidence for dust production (Ks-[22] >~ 0.55 mag; AK
Hya, V744 Cen, RU Crt, alpha Her). Stars below this limit were not detected (BQ
Gem, eps Oct, NU Pav, II Hya, CL Hyi, ET Vir, SX Pav). Ks-[22] colour is found
to trace mass-loss rate to well within an order of magnitude. This confirms
existing results, indicating a factor of 100 increase in AGB-star mass-loss
rates at a pulsation period of ~60 days, similar to the known ""superwind""
trigger at ~300 days. Between ~60 and ~300 days, an approximately constant
mass-loss rate and wind velocity of ~3.7 x 10^-7 solar masses per year and ~8
km/s is found. While this has not been corrected for observational biases, this
rapid increase in mass-loss rate suggests a need to recalibrate the treatment
of AGB mass loss in stellar evolution models. The comparative lack of
correlation between mass-loss rate and luminosity (for L <~ 6300 solar
luminosities) suggests that the mass-loss rates of low-luminosity AGB-star
winds are set predominantly by pulsations, not radiation pressure on dust,
which sets only the outflow velocity. We predict that mass-loss rates from
low-luminosity AGB stars, which exhibit optically thin winds, should be largely
independent of metallicity, but may be strongly dependent on stellar mass.

consider an alternative scenario that with mass fallback, the collapsing star

result in a successful stellar explosion. With an improved version of the

history for a suite of pre-SN stellar models with different initial surface
rotational velocities, masses and metallicities, and by comparing the disk wind
energy with the binding energy of the infalling stellar envelope. We show that
the most promising models to be exploded successfully by this new channel are
those relatively compact pre-SN stars with relatively low metallicities and not
too low specific angular momenta. The total energies of the explosions are
$\sim 10^{51-52}$ergs, and a more massive progenitor may produce a more

by using the ego-motion estimation and the disparity map of the previous frame,
we can set a prior base that enables us to reduce the complexity of the current

tubular structure segmentation applications. In this paper, we propose a new
minimal path model associated with a dynamic Riemannian metric embedded with an
appearance feature coherence penalty and an adaptive anisotropy enhancement
term. The features that characterize the appearance and anisotropy properties
of a tubular structure are extracted through the associated orientation score.
The proposed dynamic Riemannian metric is updated in the course of the geodesic
distance computation carried out by the efficient single-pass fast marching
method. Compared to state-of-the-art minimal path models, the proposed minimal
path model is able to extract the desired tubular structures from a complicated
vessel tree structure. In addition, we propose an efficient prior path-based
method to search for vessel radius value at each centerline position of the
target. Finally, we perform the numerical experiments on both synthetic and
real images. The quantitive validation is carried out on retinal vessel images.
The results indicate that the proposed model indeed achieves a promising
performance.

applying convolutional neural networks to the detection of eye fixations.
Although a number of imagebased salient object and fixation detection models
have been proposed, video fixation detection still requires more exploration.
Different from image analysis, motion and temporal information is a crucial
factor affecting human attention when viewing video sequences. Although
existing models based on local contrast and low-level features have been
extensively researched, they failed to simultaneously consider interframe
motion and temporal information across neighboring video frames, leading to
unsatisfactory performance when handling complex scenes. To this end, we
propose a novel and efficient video eye fixation detection model to improve the
saliency detection performance. By simulating the memory mechanism and visual
attention mechanism of human beings when watching a video, we propose a
step-gained fully convolutional network by combining the memory information on
the time axis with the motion information on the space axis while storing the
saliency information of the current frame. The model is obtained through
hierarchical training, which ensures the accuracy of the detection. Extensive
experiments in comparison with 11 state-of-the-art methods are carried out, and
the results show that our proposed model outperforms all 11 methods across a
number of publicly available datasets.

fields identification problems in the framework of Bayesian inference. An
ensemble-based variable separation (VS) method is proposed to approximate
multiscale basis functions used to build a coarse model. The
variable-separation expression is constructed for stochastic multiscale basis
functions based on the random field, which is treated Gauss process as prior
information. To this end, multiple local inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary
condition problems are required to be solved, and the ensemble-based method is
used to obtain variable separation forms for the corresponding local functions.
The local functions share the same interpolate rule for different physical
basis functions in each coarse block. This approach significantly improves the
efficiency of computation. We obtain the variable separation expression of
multiscale basis functions, which can be used to the models with different
boundary conditions and source terms, once the expression constructed. The
proposed method is applied to discontinuous field identification problems where
the hybrid of total variation and Gaussian (TG) densities are imposed as the
penalty. We give a convergence analysis of the approximate posterior to the
reference one with respect to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under the
hybrid prior. The proposed method is applied to identify discontinuous
structures in permeability fields. Two patterns of discontinuous structures are
considered in numerical examples: separated blocks and nested blocks.

illustrate that in the discrete regime all linear states lead to nonlinear

rich structure of the equilibrium set, consisting of non-trivial topological
(kink-shaped) interpolations between the adjacent minima of the on-site

dynamical evolution results also provide insight on the potential stability of
the equilibrium branches, and glimpses of the emerging global bifurcation

superconductors have been attracting increasing attention. Recently, a new type
of nematic order has been discovered in heavily hole-doped ($n_d=5.5$) compound
AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A=Cs, Rb). The discovered nematicity has $B_{2g}$ (=$d_{xy}$)
symmetry, rotated by $45^\circ$ from the $B_{1g}$ (=$d_{x^2-y^2}$) nematicity
in usual compounds with $n_d\approx6$. We predict that the ""nematic bond
order"", which is the symmetry-breaking of the correlated hopping, is
responsible for the $B_{2g}$ nematic order in AFe$_2$As$_2$. The Dirac pockets
in AFe$_2$As$_2$ is essential to stabilize the $B_{2g}$ bond order. Both
$B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ nematicity in A$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ are naturally
induced by the Aslamazov-Larkin many-body process, which describes the
spin-fluctuation-driven charge instability. The present study gives a great
hint to control the nature of charge nematicity by modifying the orbital
character and the topology of the Fermi surface.

in biomedical and social science applications. The causal framework based on
counterfactuals is currently the standard approach to mediation, with important
methodological advances introduced in the literature in the last decade,
especially for simple mediation, that is with one mediator at the time. Among a
variety of alternative approaches, K. Imai et al. showed theoretical results
and developed an R package to deal with simple mediation as well as with
multiple mediation involving multiple mediators conditionally independent given
the treatment and baseline covariates. This approach does not allow to consider
the often encountered situation in which an unobserved common cause induces a
spurious correlation between the mediators. In this context, which we refer to
as mediation with uncausally related mediators, we show that, under appropriate
hypothesis, the natural direct and joint indirect effects are
non-parametrically identifiable. Moreover, we adopt the quasi-Bayesian
algorithm developed by Imai et al. and propose a procedure based on the
simulation of counterfactual distributions to estimate not only the direct and
joint indirect effects but also the indirect effects through individual
mediators. We study the properties of the proposed estimators through
simulations. As an illustration, we apply our method on a real data set from a
large cohort to assess the effect of hormone replacement treatment on breast
cancer risk through three mediators, namely dense mammographic area, nondense

their performance strongly relies on an appropriate choice of target matrix.
This paper introduces a more flexible class of linear shrinkage estimators that
can accommodate multiple shrinkage target matrices, directly accounting for the
uncertainty regarding the target choice. This is done within a conjugate
Bayesian framework, which is computationally efficient. Using both simulated
and real data, we show that the proposed estimator is less sensitive to target
misspecification and can outperform state-of-the-art (nonparametric)
single-target linear shrinkage estimators. Using protein expression data from
The Cancer Proteome Atlas we illustrate how multiple sources of prior
information (obtained from more than 30 different cancer types) can be
incorporated into the proposed multi-target linear shrinkage estimator. In
particular, it is shown that the target-specific weights can provide insights

Hamiltonian DNLS lattice. By using energy arguments in finite and infinite
dimensional phase spaces (as guided by the boundary conditions imposed), we
prove analytical upper and lower bounds for the collapse time, valid for both
the defocusing and focusing cases of the model. In addition, the existence of a
critical value in the linear loss parameter is underlined, separating finite
time-collapse from energy decay. The numerical simulations, performed for a
wide class of initial data, not only verified the validity of our bounds, but
also revealed that the analytical bounds can be useful in identifying two
distinct types of collapse dynamics, namely, extended or localized. Pending on
the discreteness /amplitude regime, the system exhibits either type of collapse
and the actual blow-up times approach, and in many cases are in excellent
agreement, with the upper or the lower bound respectively. When these times lie
between the analytical bounds, they are associated with a nontrivial mixing of
the above major types of collapse dynamics, due to the corroboration of
defocusing/focusing effects and energy gain/loss, in the presence of
discreteness and nonlinearity.

Network Creation Games introduced by Fabrikant et al. In this model every agent
(node) buys links at a prefixed price $\alpha > 0$ in order to get connected to
the network formed by all the $n$ agents. In this setting, the reformulated
tree conjecture states that for $\alpha > n$, every Nash equilibrium network is
a tree. Moreover, Demaine et al. conjectured that the price of anarchy for this
model is constant. Since it was shown that the price of anarchy for trees is
constant, if the tree conjecture were true, then the price of anarchy would be
constant for $\alpha > n$.
  Up to now it has been proved that the \PoA is constant $(i)$ in the
\emph{lower range}, for $\alpha = O(n^{1-\delta})$ with $\delta \geq
\frac{1}{\log n}$ and $(ii)$ in the \emph{upper range}, for $\alpha > 4n-13$.
In contrast, the best upper bound known for the price of anarchy for the
remaining range is $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$.
  In this paper we give new insights into the structure of the Nash equilibria
for $\alpha > n$ and we enlarge the range of the parameter $\alpha$ for which
the price of anarchy is constant. Specifically, we prove that the price of
anarchy is constant for $\alpha > n(1+\epsilon)$ by showing that every
equilibrium of diameter greater than some prefixed constant is a tree.

We find that both $\alpha$ and $p$ generally display a harder-when-brighter

and strengthen the result that $p$ must vary in order to explain the observed
X-ray spectral variability during flares, which would have useful implications
for interpreting the associated higher-energy spectral variability. We see
apparent electron spectral hysteresis in many but not all $p$-flux plots that
takes a form of ""loop"" or oblique""8"". We obtain a tight $p$-hardness ratio (HR)
relation and a tighter $p$-$\alpha$ relation using spectra of flaring periods,
both of which are also applicable to stacked data of quiescent periods. We
demonstrate that these two empirical relations can be used efficiently to
estimate $p$ from HR or $\alpha$ that is readily achieved. Finally, we find
that, when considering TeV blazars as a whole, $\alpha$ and X-ray luminosity
are positively correlated, $E_{\rm{p}}$ is negatively correlated with $p$ and
$\alpha$, and $E_{\rm{p}}$ is positively correlated with HR; all these
correlations are in line with the blazar sequence. However, after correcting
for the Doppler boosting effect, $\alpha$ and intrinsic X-ray luminosity follow
an anti-correlation.

First, using the collective variable method we find free energy, pressure and

solvent-ion interactions beyond the hard core. In the special case of a RPM-HS
mixture, we consider two regularizations of the Coulomb potential inside the

the WCA approximation and the optimized regularization giving the optimized RPA
(ORPA) or the mean spherical approximation (MSA). Furthermore, we calculate the
phase coexistence using the associative mean spherical approximation (AMSA). In
general, the three approximations produce qualitatively similar phase diagrams
of the RPM-HS mixture, i.e., a fluid-fluid coexistence envelope with an upper
critical solution point, a shift of the coexistence region towards higher total
number densities and higher solvent concentrations with increasing pressure,
and a small increase of the critical temperature with an increase of pressure.
As for a pure RPM, the AMSA leads to the best agreement with the available
simulation data when the association constant proposed by Olaussen and Stell is

of spiking activity in the brain is not mere noise, but rather the reflection
of a sampling-based encoding scheme for probabilistic computing. Since the
precise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this
context, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,
either on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often
assuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these
assumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share
receptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at
the same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a
function of their membrane potential and conductance. We suggest that spiking
neural networks may, in fact, have no need for noise to perform sampling-based
Bayesian inference. We study analytically the effect of auto- and
cross-correlations in functionally Bayesian spiking networks and demonstrate
how their effect translates to synaptic interaction strengths, rendering them
controllable through synaptic plasticity. This allows even small ensembles of
interconnected deterministic spiking networks to simultaneously and
co-dependently shape their output activity through learning, enabling them to
perform complex Bayesian computation without any need for noise, which we
demonstrate in silico, both in classical simulation and in neuromorphic
emulation. These results close a gap between the abstract models and the

consider a unidirectional flow of pedestrians in a corridor and assume that the
velocity decreases with the average density according to the fundamental
diagram. Our model is formed from a coupling between a density dependent
stochastic differential equation and a nonlinear partial differential equation
for the density, and is hence of McKean--Vlasov type. We discuss
identifiability of the parameters appearing in the fundamental diagram from
trajectories of individuals, and we introduce optimization and Bayesian methods

has been widely assumed that spiral arms in galaxies with two distinct
symmetrical arms are the products of density waves that propagate around the
disk, with the spiral arms being visibly enhanced by the star formation that is
triggered as the passing wave compresses gas in the galaxy disk. Such a
persistent wave would propagate with an approximately constant angular speed,
its pattern speed Op. The quasi-stationary density wave theory can be tested by
measuring this quantity and showing that it does not vary with radius in the
galaxy. Unfortunately, this measurement is difficult because Op is only
indirectly connected to observables such as the stellar rotation speed. Here,
we use the detailed information on stellar populations of the grand-design
spiral galaxy UGC 3825, extracted from spectral mapping, to measure the offset
between young stars of a known age and the spiral arm in which they formed,
allowing the first direct measure of Op at a range of radii. The offset in this
galaxy is found to be as expected for a pattern speed that varies little with
radius, indicating consistency with a quasi-stationary density wave, and
lending credence to this new method.

incorporate practical exercises into the course corpus to give students the
hands-on experience necessary for understanding and mastering programming.
These exercises, apart from technical challenges, come with a series of
questions to be addressed, for example: which fraction of the participants'
time should they take (compared to video lectures and other course activities),
which difficulty should be aimed for, how much guidance should be offered and
how much repetition should be incorporated? The perceived difficulty of a task
depends on previous knowledge, supplied hints, the required time for solving
and the number of failed attempts the participant made. Furthermore, the detail
and accuracy of the problem description, the restrictiveness of the applied
test cases and the preparation provided specifically for a given exercise also
influence the perceived difficulty of a task. In this paper, we explore the
data of three programming courses to find criteria for optimal practical
programming exercises. Based on over 3 million executions and scoring runs of
participants' task submissions, we aim to deduct exercise difficulty, student
patterns in approaching the tasks and potential flaws in task descriptions and
preparatory videos. We compare our findings to in class trainings and
traditional, mostly video and quiz based MOOCs. Finally, we propose approaches

distributed machines where each machine has access to only a subset of
features. A central machine is then responsible for learning the structure
based on received messages from the other nodes. We present a set of
communication efficient strategies, which are theoretically proved to convey
sufficient information for reliable learning of the structure. In particular,
our analyses show that even if each machine sends only the signs of its local
data samples to the central node, the tree structure can still be recovered
with high accuracy. Our simulation results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our strategies achieve a desired accuracy in inferring the
underlying structure, while spending a small budget on communication.

is at variance with their intense star-formation episode. The CO molecule,
often used a tracer of H2 through a conversion function, is selectively
photodissociated in dust-poor environments and, as a result, a potentially
large fraction of H2 is expected to reside in the so-called CO-dark gas, where
it could be traced instead by infrared cooling lines [CI], [CII], and [OI].
Although the fraction of CO-dark gas to total molecular gas is expected to be
relatively large in metal-poor galaxies, many uncertainties remain due to the
difficulty in identifying the main heating mechanism associated to the cooling
lines observed in such galaxies. Investigations of the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy
Survey show that the heating mechanism in the neutral gas of BCDs cannot be
dominated by the photoelectric effect on dust grains below some threshold
metallicity, implying that other heating mechanisms need to be invoked, along
with a new interpretation of the corresponding infrared line diagnostics. In
the study presented here and in Lebouteiller et al. 2017, we use optical and
infrared lines to constrain the physical conditions in the HII region + HI
region of the BCD IZw18 (18Mpc; 2% solar metallicity) within a consistent
photoionization and photodissociation model. We show that the HI region is
entirely heated by a single ultraluminous X-ray source with important
consequences on the applicability of [CII] to trace the star-formation rate and
to trace the CO-dark gas. We derive stringent upper limits on the size of H2
clumps that may be detected in the future with JWST and IRAM/NOEMA. We also
show that the nature of the X-ray source can be inferred from the corresponding
signatures in the ISM. Finally we speculate that star formation may be quenched
in extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies due to X-ray photoionization.

crowded polymers, we model polymers as penetrable ellipsoids, whose shape
fluctuations are governed by the statistics of self-avoiding walks, appropriate
for a polymer in a good solvent. Within this coarse-grained model, we perform
Monte Carlo simulations of mixtures of polymers and hard-nanosphere crowders,
including trial changes in polymer size and shape. Penetration of polymers by
crowders is incorporated via a free energy cost predicted by polymer field
theory. To analyze the impact of crowding on polymer conformations in different
solvents, we compute average polymer shape distributions, radius of gyration,
volume, and asphericity over ranges of polymer-to-crowder size ratio and
crowder volume fraction. The simulation results are accurately predicted by a
free-volume theory of polymer crowding. Comparison of results for polymers in
good and theta solvents indicates that excluded-volume interactions between
polymer segments significantly affect crowding, especially in the limit of
crowders much smaller than polymers. Our approach may help to motivate future
experimental studies of polymers in crowded environments, with possible

  Verification and Validation",,"10.1109/ICST.2017.52",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Test automation involves the automatic execution of test scripts instead of
being manually run. This significantly reduces the amount of manual effort
needed and thus is of great interest to the software testing industry. There
are two key problems in the existing tools and methods for test automation - a)
Creating an automation test script is essentially a code development task,
which most testers are not trained on; and b) the automation test script is
seldom readable, making the task of maintenance an effort intensive process. We
present the Accelerating Test Automation Platform (ATAP) which is aimed at
making test automation accessible to non-programmers. ATAP allows the creation
of an automation test script through a domain specific language based on
English. The English-like test scripts are automatically converted to machine
executable code using Selenium WebDriver. ATAP's English-like test script makes
it easy for non-programmers to author. The functional flow of an ATAP script is
easy to understand as well thus making maintenance simpler (you can understand
the flow of the test script when you revisit it many months later). ATAP has
been built around the Eclipse ecosystem and has been used in a real-life
testing project. We present the details of the implementation of ATAP and the
results from its usage in practice.

a potential landscape created by a honeycomb array of microcavity pillars in
the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting in the external
magnetic field. The coupling rate between the microcavity pillars can be
strongly impacted even by weak out-of-phase temporal modulations of the depths
of the corresponding potential wells. When such a modulation is implemented in
truncated honeycomb arrays that realize a polariton topological insulator,
which supports unidirectional edge states in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling and Zeeman splitting, it allows controlling the velocity of the
states. The origin of the phenomenon is the dynamical modulation with a proper
frequency, which notably changes the dispersion of the system and the group
velocity of edge states. We show that such a control is possible for modulation
frequencies close to resonances for inhibition of tunnelling in a two-well
configuration. Edge states considerably slow down, and even stop completely,
when the modulation frequency approaches a resonant value, while above such
frequency splitting of the edge states into wavepackets moving with different

la Affleck-Dine, which use a decay of two superheavy scalar fields with close
masses. These scalars acquire non-zero expectation values during inflation
through linear couplings to a function of an inflaton. After the inflaton
decay, the model possesses approximate U(1)-invariance, explicitly broken by a
small mass splitting. This splitting leads to the baryogenesis in the early
Universe. Resulting baryon asymmetry is automatically small for the scalars
with the masses about the Grand Unification scale and larger. It is fully
determined by the inflaton dynamics and the Lagrangian parameters, i.e., is
independent of initial pre-inflationary conditions for the scalars. As a
consequence, baryon perturbations are purely adiabatic. We point out a possible
origin of the mass splitting: masses of scalars degenerate at some large energy
scale may acquire different loop corrections due to the interaction with the
inflaton. Compared to electroweak baryogenesis and conventional Affleck-Dine
scenarios, our mechanism generically leads to the proton decay suppressed by
the powers of the superheavy scalar masses, which makes this scenario
potentially testable.

$S^{4n-1} $ to $S^{2n}$, and is an important invariant in homotopy theory. The
goal of this paper is to use the Koszul duality theory for $E_n$-operads to
define a generalization of the classical Hopf invariant. One way of defining
the classical Hopf invariant is by defining a pairing between the cohomology of
the associative bar construction on the cochains of a space $X$ and the
homotopy groups of $X$. In this paper we will give a generalization of the
classical Hopf invariant by defining a pairing between the cohomology of the
$E_n$-bar construction on the cochains of $X$ and the homotopy groups of $X$.
This pairing gives us a set of invariants of homotopy classes of maps from
$S^m$ to a simplicial set $X$, this pairing can detect more homotopy classes of
maps than the classical Hopf invariant.
  The second part of the paper is devoted to combining the $E_n$-Hopf
invariants with the Koszul duality theory for $E_n$-operads to get a relation
between the $E_n$-Hopf invariants of a space $X$ and the $E_{n+1}$-Hopf
invariants of the suspension of $X$. This is done by studying the suspension
morphism for the $E_\infty$-operad, which is a morphism from the
$E_{\infty}$-operad to the desuspension of the $E_\infty$-operad. We show that
it induces a functor from $E_\infty$-algebras to $E_\infty$-algebras, which has
the property that it sends an $E_\infty$-model for a simplicial set $X$ to an
$E_\infty$-model for the suspension of $X$.
  We use this result to give a relation between the $E_n$-Hopf invariants of
maps from $S^m$ into $X$ and the $E_{n+1}$-Hopf invariants of maps from
$S^{m+1}$ into the suspension of $X$. One of the main results we show here, is
that this relation can be used to define invariants of stable homotopy classes

state (EOS) is required over wide ranges of density and temperature as well as
under conditions in which neutrinos are trapped, and the effects of magnetic
fields and rotation prevail. Here we assess the status of dense matter theory
and point out the successes and limitations of approaches currently in use. A
comparative study of the excluded volume (EV) and virial approaches for the
$np\alpha$ system using the equation of state of Akmal, Pandharipande and
Ravenhall for interacting nucleons is presented in the sub-nuclear density
regime. Owing to the excluded volume of the $\alpha$-particles, their mass
fraction vanishes in the EV approach below the baryon density 0.1 fm$^{-3}$,
whereas it continues to rise due to the predominantly attractive interactions
in the virial approach. The EV approach of Lattimer et al. is extended here to
include clusters of light nuclei such as d, $^3$H and $^3$He in addition to
$\alpha$-particles. Results of the relevant state variables from this
development are presented and enable comparisons with related but slightly
different approaches in the literature. We also comment on some of the sweet
and sour aspects of the supra-nuclear EOS. The extent to which the neutron star
gravitational and baryon masses vary due to thermal effects, neutrino trapping,
magnetic fields and rotation are summarized from earlier studies in which the
effects from each of these sources were considered separately. Increases of
about $20\% (\gtrsim 50\%)$ occur for rigid (differential) rotation with
comparable increases occurring in the presence of magnetic fields only for
fields in excess of $10^{18}$ Gauss. Comparatively smaller changes occur due to
thermal effects and neutrino trapping. Some future studies to gain further
insight into the outcome of dynamical simulations are suggested.

presence of constant power loads significantly aggravates this issue, hence
motivating the development of new analysis methods for both existence and

analysis of solutions of a set of nonlinear algebraic equations of the form
$f(x)=0$, where $f:\mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{n}$, and the associated
differential equation $\dot x=f(x)$. By invoking advanced concepts of dynamical
systems theory and effectively exploiting its monotonicity, we exhibit all
possible scenarios for existence, uniqueness and stability, of its equilibria.
We prove that, if there are equilibria, there is a distinguished one that is
locally stable and attractive, and we give some physically-interpretable
conditions such that it is unique. Moreover, a simple on-line procedure to
decide whether equilibria exist of not, and to compute the distinguished one is
proposed. In addition, we show how the proposed framework can be applied to
long-term voltage stability analysis in AC power systems, multi-terminal

topic in cosmology, particularly in the context of sharpening the measurement
of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak. Nonlinear reconstruction
algorithms developed in recent years, when applied to late-time matter fields,
can recover to a substantial degree the initial density distribution, however,
when applied to sparse tracers of the matter field, the performance is poorer.
In this paper we apply the Shi et al. non-linear reconstruction method to
biased tracers in order to establish what factors affect the reconstruction
performance. We find that grid resolution, tracer number density and mass
assignment scheme all have a significant impact on the performance of our
reconstruction method, with triangular-shaped-cloud (TSC) mass assignment and a
grid resolution of ${\sim}1{-}2h^{-1}$ Mpc being the optimal choice. We also
show that our method can be easily adapted to include generic tracer biases up
to quadratic order in the reconstruction formalism. Applying the reconstruction
to halo and galaxy samples with a range of tracer number densities, we find
that the linear bias is by far the most important bias term, while including
nonlocal and nonlinear biases only leads to marginal improvements on the
reconstruction performance. Overall, including bias in the reconstruction
substantially improves the recovery of BAO wiggles, down to
$k\sim0.25~h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ for tracer number densities between
$2\times10^{-4}$ and $2\times10^{-3}~(h^{-1}\text{Mpc})^{-3}$.

and necessary condition for the detectability of a UoC, and then design a
detection algorithm that allows us to determine the cone where the target
signal is residing. The phase-retrieval will be then performed within the
detected cone, which can be achieved by using at most $\Gamma$-number of
measurements and with very low complexity, where $\Gamma (\leq n)$ is the
maximum of the ranks of the generators for the UoC. Numerical experiments are
provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, and to exhibit
comparisons with some existing phase-retrieval methods.

polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB) via Thomson
scattering, while through this scenario, the generation of circular

has not been excluded in observational evidence. The generation of CMB photons
circular polarization via their Compton scattering with polarized cosmic
electrons is considered in this paper. Our motivation for considering polarized
Compton scattering comes from the effects of the external magnetic field in
large scale, the chiral magnetic instability and new physics interactions of
the cosmic electrons. It is shown that damping term of polarized Compton
scattering in the presence of scalar perturbation can generate circular
polarization in CMB radiation, so that the power spectrum of circular
polarization of CMB $C_l^{V(S)}$ is proportional to the power spectrum of
temperature anisotropy of CMB $C_l^{I(S)}$ and also $\delta^2$ which is a
fraction of polarized electron number density to the total one with net Left-
or Right-handed polarizations. We have discussed that at least we need
$\delta<10^{-4}$ to find consistency with a reported upper limit of CMB
circular polarization.

systems. Here we consider functional repair codes, where individual storage
nodes that fail may be repaired efficiently and the ability to recover original
data and to further repair failed nodes is preserved. There are two predominant
approaches to repair codes: a coding theoretic approach and a vector space
approach. We explore the relationship between the two and frame the later in
terms of projective geometry. We find that many of the constructions proposed
in the literature can be seen to arise from natural and well-studied geometric
objects, and that this perspective gives a framework that provides
opportunities for generalisations and new constructions that can lead to
greater flexibility in trade-offs between various desirable properties. We also
frame the cut-set bound obtained from network coding in terms of projective
geometry. We explore the notion of strictly functional repair codes, for which
there exist nodes that cannot be replaced exactly. Currently only one known
example is given in the literature, due to Hollmann and Poh. We examine this
phenomenon from a projective geometry point of view, and discuss how strict
functionality can arise. Finally, we consider the issue that the view of a
repair code as a collection of sets of vector/projective subspaces is recursive
in nature and makes it hard to visualise what a collection of nodes looks like
and how one might approach a construction. Here we provide another view of
using directed graphs that gives us non-recursive criteria for determining
whether a family of collections of subspaces constitutes a function, exact, or
strictly functional repair code, which may be of use in searching for new codes
with desirable properties.

algorithms coloring graphs optimally (i.e.\ with the minimum number of colors)
in the LOCAL model of computation. Most of the work on distributed vertex
coloring so far has focused on coloring graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ with
at most $\Delta+1$ colors (or $\Delta$ colors when some simple obstructions are
forbidden). When $\Delta$ is sufficiently large and $c\ge \Delta-k_\Delta+1$,
for some integer $k_\Delta\approx \sqrt{\Delta}-2$, we give a distributed
algorithm that given a $c$-colorable graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$,
finds a $c$-coloring of $G$ in $\min\{O((\log\Delta)^{1/12}\log n), 2^{O(\log
\Delta+\sqrt{\log \log n})}\}$ rounds, with high probability. The lower bound
$\Delta-k_\Delta+1$ is best possible in the sense that for infinitely many
values of $\Delta$, we prove that when $\chi(G)\le \Delta -k_\Delta$, finding
an optimal coloring of $G$ requires $\Omega(n)$ rounds. Our proof is a light
adaptation of a remarkable result of Molloy and Reed, who proved that for
$\Delta$ large enough, for any $c\ge \Delta - k_\Delta$ deciding whether
$\chi(G)\le c$ is in {\textsf{P}}, while Embden-Weinert \emph{et al.}\ proved
that for $c\le \Delta-k_\Delta-1$, the same problem is {\textsf{NP}}-complete.
Note that the sequential and distributed thresholds differ by one. We also show
that for any sufficiently large $\Delta$, and $\Omega(\log \Delta)\le k \le
\Delta/100$, every graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ and clique number at most
$\Delta-k$ can be efficiently colored with at most $\Delta-\varepsilon k$
colors, for some absolute constant $\varepsilon >0$, with a randomized
algorithm running in $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ rounds with high probability.

new routes for increasing the speed of information transport up to frequencies
thousand times faster than in modern electronics. However, up to date,
disentangling the exact contributions from bulk and surface transport to the
subpicosecond dynamics of these materials remains a difficult challenge. Here,
using time- and angle-resolved photoemission, we demonstrate that driving a TI
from the bulk-conducting into the bulk-insulating transport regime allows to
selectively switch on and off the emergent channels of ultrafast transport
between the surface and the bulk. We thus establish that ultrafast transport is
one of the main driving mechanisms responsible for the decay of excited
electrons in prototypical TIs following laser excitation. We further show how
ultrafast transport strongly affects the thermalization and scattering dynamics
of the excited states up to high energies above the Fermi level. In particular,
we observe how inhibiting the transport channels leads to a thermalization
bottleneck that substantially slows down electron-hole recombination via
electron-electron scatterings. Our results pave the way for exploiting
ultrafast transport to control thermalization time scales in TI-based
optoelectronic applications, and expand the capabilities of TIs as intrinsic
solar cells.

method for optimizing recommendation models. It is widely known that the
performance of BPR depends largely on the quality of negative sampler. In this
paper, we make two contributions with respect to BPR. First, we find that
sampling negative items from the whole space is unnecessary and may even
degrade the performance. Second, focusing on the purchase feedback of
E-commerce, we propose an effective sampler for BPR by leveraging the
additional view data. In our proposed sampler, users' viewed interactions are
considered as an intermediate feedback between those purchased and unobserved
interactions. The pairwise rankings of user preference among these three types
of interactions are jointly learned, and a user-oriented weighting strategy is
considered during learning process, which is more effective and flexible.
Compared to the vanilla BPR that applies a uniform sampler on all candidates,
our view-enhanced sampler enhances BPR with a relative improvement over 37.03%
and 16.40% on two real-world datasets. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering users' additional feedback when modeling their preference on
different items, which avoids sampling negative items indiscriminately and
inefficiently.

formulate the isothermal incompressible equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics
for reactive multispecies mixtures involving charged species in the
electroneutral limit, and design a numerical algorithm to solve these

treats all species on an equal footing, accounting for cross-diffusion and
non-ideality using Maxwell-Stefan theory. By enforcing local electroneutrality
as a constraint, we obtain an elliptic equation for the electric potential that
replaces the Poisson equation in the fluctuating PNP equations. We develop a
second-order midpoint predictor-corrector algorithm to solve either the

instability, triggered by thermal fluctuations, at an interface where an acid

the four ions diffuse with very different coefficients, one must treat each ion

linearly with the degree of compositional segregation over the entire the
regime studied. Stable glass forming alloys that can be quenched at low quench
rates do not, as a rule, exhibit such thermodynamically unstable behavior near
to or above their glass transition temperatures. Hence, the microstructures
exhibited in these simulations are unlikely to reflect the actual
microstructures or fracture behaviors of the glassy alloys they seek to
elucidate.

become an important tool in clinical assessment of patient outcomes. In this
paper, we introduce Composer, a visual analysis tool for orthopedic surgeons to
compare changes in physical functions of a patient cohort following various
spinal procedures. The goal of our project is to help researchers analyze
outcomes of procedures and facilitate informed decision-making about treatment
options between patient and clinician. Methods: In collaboration with
Orthopedic surgeons and researchers, we defined domain-specific user
requirements to inform the design. We developed the tool in an iterative
process with our collaborators to develop and refine functionality. With
Composer, analysts can dynamically define a patient cohort using demographic
information, clinical parameters, and events in patient medical histories and
then analyze patient-reported outcome scores for the cohort over time, as well
as compare it to other cohorts. Using Composer's current iteration, we provide
a usage scenario for use of the tool in a clinical setting. Conclusion: We have
developed a prototype cohort analysis tool to help clinicians assess patient
treatment options by analyzing prior cases with similar characteristics. Though
Composer was designed using patient data specific to Orthopedic research, we
believe the tool is generalizable to other healthcare domains. A long term goal
for Composer is to develop the application into a shared decision-making tool
that allows translation of comparison and analysis from a clinician facing
interface into visual representations to communicate treatment options to
patients.

on average in different reference frames, not on a trial-by-trial basis. This
conservation is SO(3) invariant in the relevant symmetry plane in real space

Since NPRF is also responsible for the postulates of special relativity, and
therefore its counterintuitive aspects of time dilation and length contraction,
we see that the symmetry group relating non-relativistic quantum mechanics and

Transfer Learning aims to utilize the learned knowledge from source tasks to
help new tasks to improve the sample complexity of the new tasks. Considering
that data collection in RL is both more time and cost consuming and Q-learning
converges slowly comparing to supervised learning, different kinds of transfer
RL algorithms are designed. However, most of them are heuristic with no
theoretical guarantee of the convergence rate. Therefore, it is important for
us to clearly understand when and how will transfer learning help RL method and
provide the theoretical guarantee for the improvement of the sample complexity.
In this paper, we propose to transfer the Q-function learned in the source task
to the target of the Q-learning in the new task when certain safe conditions
are satisfied. We call this new transfer Q-learning method target transfer
Q-Learning. The safe conditions are necessary to avoid the harm to the new
tasks and thus ensure the convergence of the algorithm. We study the
convergence rate of the target transfer Q-learning. We prove that if the two
tasks are similar with respect to the MDPs, the optimal Q-functions in the
source and new RL tasks are similar which means the error of the transferred
target Q-function in new MDP is small. Also, the convergence rate analysis
shows that the target transfer Q-Learning will converge faster than Q-learning
if the error of the transferred target Q-function is smaller than the current
Q-function in the new task. Based on our theoretical results, we design the
safe condition as the Bellman error of the transferred target Q-function is
less than the current Q-function. Our experiments are consistent with our

a quantum computer or a quantum junction) by a neighboring fluctuator, which
generates a fluctuating electric field -- a telegraph noise (TN) -- on the
electrons in the system. An example is a two-level system, that randomly
fluctuates between two states with Boltzmann weights determined by an effective
temperature. To consider whether this description is physically reasonable, we
study it in the simplest example of a quantum dot which is coupled to two
electronic reservoirs and to a single fluctuator. Averaging over the histories
of the TN yields an inflow of energy flux from the fluctuator into the
electronic reservoirs, which persists even when the fluctuator's effective
temperature is equal to (or smaller than) the common reservoirs temperature.
Therefore, the fuluctuator's temperature cannot represent a real environment.
Since our formalism allows for any time dependent energy on the dot, we also
apply it to the case of a non-random electric field which oscillates
periodically in time. Averaging over a period of these oscillations yields
results which are very similar to those of the TN model, including the energy
flow into the electronic reservoirs. We conclude that both models may not give
good representations of the true environment.

in which an agent is trained to complete a given task, typically formalized as
the maximization of a reward signal over time, while concurrently avoiding
undesirable actions or states, associated to lower rewards, or penalties. The
construction and balancing of different reward components can be difficult in
the presence of multiple objectives, yet is crucial for producing a satisfying
policy. For example, in reaching a target while avoiding obstacles, low
collision penalties can lead to reckless movements while high penalties can
discourage exploration. To circumvent this limitation, we examine the effect of
past actions in terms of safety to estimate which are acceptable or should be
avoided in the future. We then actively reshape the action space of the agent
during reinforcement learning, so that reward-driven exploration is constrained
within safety limits. We propose an algorithm enabling the learning of such
safety constraints in parallel with reinforcement learning and demonstrate its
effectiveness in terms of both task completion and training time.

  Setting",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reinforcement learning (RL) , one of the key components is policy
evaluation, which aims to estimate the value function (i.e., expected long-term
accumulated reward) of a policy. With a good policy evaluation method, the RL
algorithms will estimate the value function more accurately and find a better
policy. When the state space is large or continuous \emph{Gradient-based
Temporal Difference(GTD)} policy evaluation algorithms with linear function
approximation are widely used. Considering that the collection of the
evaluation data is both time and reward consuming, a clear understanding of the
finite sample performance of the policy evaluation algorithms is very important
to reinforcement learning. Under the assumption that data are i.i.d. generated,
previous work provided the finite sample analysis of the GTD algorithms with
constant step size by converting them into convex-concave saddle point
problems. However, it is well-known that, the data are generated from Markov
processes rather than i.i.d. in RL problems.. In this paper, in the realistic
Markov setting, we derive the finite sample bounds for the general
convex-concave saddle point problems, and hence for the GTD algorithms. We have
the following discussions based on our bounds. (1) With variants of step size,
GTD algorithms converge. (2) The convergence rate is determined by the step
size, with the mixing time of the Markov process as the coefficient. The faster
the Markov processes mix, the faster the convergence. (3) We explain that the
experience replay trick is effective by improving the mixing property of the
Markov process. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to
provide finite sample bounds for the GTD algorithms in Markov setting.

been widely used in the parameter estimation of inverse problems.
Unfortunately, its cost may become moderately large for systems described by
high dimensional nonlinear PDEs, as EKI requires a relatively large ensemble
size to guarantee its performance. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
multi-fidelity polynomial chaos (PC) based EKI technique to address this
challenge. Our new strategy combines a large number of low-order PC surrogate
model evaluations and a small number of high-fidelity forward model
evaluations, yielding a multi-fidelity approach. Especially, we present a new
approach that adaptively constructs and refines a multi-fidelity PC surrogate
during the EKI simulation. Since the forward model evaluations are only
required for updating the low-order multi-fidelity PC model, whose number can
be much smaller than the total ensemble size of the classic EKI, the entire
computational costs are thus significantly reduced. The new algorithm was
tested through the two-dimensional time fractional inverse diffusion problems
and demonstrated great effectiveness in comparison with PC based EKI and
classic EKI.

subsequent decay into $W^+W^-$ pairs, we show that the derived constraints on
the mixing angle for the benchmark models are of the order of a few $\times
10^{-4}$, i.e., greatly improved with respect to those derived from the global
analysis of electroweak data. We combine the limits derived from diboson
production data with those obtained from the Drell--Yan process in order to
significantly extend the exclusion region in the $M_{2}$-$\xi$ parameter plane.

transactions, conditional on the current memory pool (i.e., the queue of
transactions awaiting confirmation). The results of this paper are particularly
interesting for users that want to make a Bitcoin transaction during
`heavy-traffic situations', when the transaction demand exceeds the block
capacity. In such situations, Bitcoin users tend to bid up the transaction
fees, in order to gain priority over other users that pay a lower fee. We argue
that the time until a Bitcoin transaction is confirmed can be modelled as a
particular stochastic fluid queueing process (to be precise: a
Cram\'er-Lundberg process). We approximate the queueing process in two
different ways. The first approach leads to a lower bound on the confirmation
probability, which becomes increasingly tight as traffic decreases. The second
approach relies on a diffusion approximation with a continuity correction,
which becomes increasingly accurate as traffic intensifies. The accuracy of the
approximations under different traffic loads are evaluated in a simulation
study.

Our challenge is how
we can design an effective and efficient clustering method that precisely
captures the hidden relationship between the topology and the attributes in

Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization with Positive Unlabeled Learning.
The features of our method are three holds. 1) it learns a non-linear
projection function between the different cluster assignments of the topology
and the attributes of graphs so as to capture the complicated relationship
between the topology and the attributes in real-world graphs, 2) it leverages
the positive unlabeled learning to take the effect of partially observed
positive edges into the cluster assignment, and 3) it achieves efficient
computational complexity, $O((n^2+mn)kt)$, where $n$ is the vertex size, $m$ is
the attribute size, $k$ is the number of clusters, and $t$ is the number of
iterations for learning the cluster assignment. We conducted experiments
extensively for various clustering methods with various real datasets to
validate that our method outperforms the former clustering methods regarding
the clustering quality.

incompressible Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. Special mention must
be made of the well-known ones due Gerstner and Kirchhoff, which were already
discovered in the 19th century. These two classical solutions share a common
characteristic, namely, the dependence of the coordinates from the initial
location is determined by a harmonic map, as recognized by Abrashkin and
Yakubovich, who more recently -- in the 1980s -- obtained new explicit
solutions with a similar feature. We present a more general method for
constructing new explicit solutions in Lagrangian coordinates which contain as
special cases all previously known ones. This new approach shows that in fact
""harmonic labelings"" are special cases of a much larger family. In the

and validation of a computer code, and apply it to a case study concerning the
energy consumption forecasting of a building. Validation allows to quantify
forecasting uncertainties in view of the code's final use. Here we explore the
situation where an energy provider promotes new energy contracts for
residential buildings, tailored to each customer's needs, and including a
guarantee of energy performance.
  Based on power field measurements, collected from an experimental building
cell over a certain time period, the code is calibrated, effectively reducing
the epistemic uncertainty affecting some code parameters (here albedo, thermal
bridge factor and convective coefficient). Validation is conducted by testing
the goodness of fit of the code with respect to field measures, and then by
propagating the a posteriori parametric uncertainty through the code, yielding
probabilistic forecasts of the average electric power delivered inside the cell
over a given time period.
  To illustrate the benefits of the proposed Bayesian validation framework, we
address the decision problem for an energy supplier offering a new type of
contract, wherein the customer pays a fixed fee chosen in advance, based on an
overall energy consumption forecast. According to Bayesian decision theory, we
show how to choose such a fee optimally from the point of view of the supplier,
in order to balance short-terms benefits with customer loyalty.

Such vibrations limit the
performance of sensitive instruments used, for example, for high-precision
manufacturing, nanofabrication, metrology, medical systems, or microscopy. For
improved precision, instruments and optical tables need to be isolated from
mechanical vibrations. However, common active or passive vibration isolation
systems often perform poorly when low-frequency vibration isolation is required
or are expensive. Furthermore, a simple solution such as suspension from common
bungee cords may require high ceilings. Here we developed a vibration isolation
system that uses steel springs to suspend an optical table from a common-height
ceiling. The system was designed for a fundamental resonance frequency of 0.5
Hz. Resonances and vibrations were efficiently damped in all translational and
rotational degrees of freedom of the optical table by spheres, which were
mounted underneath the table and immersed in a highly viscous silicone oil. Our
low-cost, passive system outperformed several state-of-the-art passive and
active systems in particular in the frequency range between 1-10 Hz. We
attribute this performance to a minimal coupling between the degrees of freedom
and the truly three dimensional viscous damping combined with a nonlinear
hydrodynamic finite-size effect. Furthermore, the system can be adapted to
different loads, resonance frequencies, and dimensions. In the long term, the
excellent performance of the system will allow high-precision measurements for
many different instruments.

momentum. The second set comprises of five index portfolios, third, a four-set
of twenty-five portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, size

model for the four sets of variant portfolios, we use OLS and Generalized
method of moments based robust instrumental variables technique (IVGMM). The
results obtained from the relevance, endogeneity, overidentifying restrictions,
and the Hausman's specification, tests indicate that the parameter estimates of
the six-factor model using IVGMM are robust and performs better than the OLS
