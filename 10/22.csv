of anisotropic fluid can be dealt with effectively as the energy-momentum
tensor of perfect fluid plus linear (Maxwell) electromagnetic field, we obtain
the regular higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m (Tangherlini-RN) solution
by starting with the noncommutative geometry inspired Schwarzschild solution.
Using the boundary conditions that connect the noncommutative Schwarzschild
solution in the interior of the charged perfect fluid sphere to the
Tangherlini-RN solution in the exterior of the sphere, we find that the
interior structure can be reflected by the exterior parameter, the
charge-to-mass ratio. Moreover, we investigate the stability of the boundary
under mass perturbation and indicate that the new interpretation imposes a
rigid restriction upon the charge-to-mass ratio. This restriction, in turn,
permits a stable noncommutative black hole only in the 4-dimensional spacetime.

Further, we describe the challenges faced in extracting effective training sets
from highly unorganized and class-imbalanced big data and establish methods for
online predictions with extensive data pre-processing, feature extraction and
validation through online simulation sets with unknown remaining useful lives
of the hard disks. Our algorithm performs especially well in predicting RUL
near the critical zone of a device approaching failure. With the proposed
approach we are able to predict whether a disk is going to fail in next ten
days with an average precision of 0.8435. We also show that the architecture

different models from same manufacturer through transfer learning.

spread from state to state until they gain momentum to become enacted as a
national policy. However, not every state policy reaches the national level.
Previous work has suggested that state-level policies are more likely to become
national policies depending on their geographic origin, their category of
legislation, or some characteristic of their initiating states, such as wealth,
urbanicity, or ideological liberalism. Here, we tested these hypotheses by
divorcing the set of traits from the states' identities and building predictive
forecasting models of state policies becoming national policies. Using a large,
longitudinal data set of state level policies and their traits, we train models
to predict (i) whether policies become national policy, and (ii) how many
states must pass a given policy before it becomes national. Using these models
as components, we then develop a logistic growth model to forecast when a
currently spreading state-level policy is likely to pass at the national level.
Our results indicate that traits of initiating states are not systematically
correlated with becoming national policy and they predict neither how many
states must enact a policy before it becomes national nor whether it ultimately
becomes a national law. In contrast, the cumulative number of state-level
adoptions of a policy is reasonably predictive of when a policy becomes
national. For the policies of same sex marriage and methamphetamine precursor
laws, we investigate how well the logistic growth model could forecast the
probable time horizon for true national action. We close with a data-driven
forecast of when marijuana legalization and ""stand your ground"" laws will
become national policy.

and time dynamics. It also allows us to construct a map in the reverse
direction: from local boundary Hamiltonians to the corresponding local
Hamiltonian in the bulk. Under this boundary-to-bulk mapping, the bulk geometry
emerges as an approximate, low-energy, effective theory living in the
code-space of an (approximate) HQECC on the boundary. At higher energy scales,
this emergent bulk geometry is modified in a way that matches the toy models of
black holes proposed previously for HQECC. Moreover, the duality on the level
of dynamics shows how these toy-model black holes can form dynamically.

receivers, our novel receiver substantially improves the bit-error-rate (BER)

data for decades, and their unsurpassed cost-effectiveness still make them the
technology of choice in several industries, such as media and entertainment.
Tapes are mostly used for cold storage nowadays, and therefore the study of
scheduling algorithms for read requests tailored for these devices has been
largely neglected in the literature. In this article, we investigate the Linear
Tape Scheduling Problem (LTSP), in which read requests associated with files
stored on a single-tracked magnetic tape should be scheduled in a way that the
sum of all response times are minimized. LTSP has many similarities with
classical combinatorial optimization problems such as the Traveling Repairmen
Problem and the Dial-a-Ride Problem restricted to the real line; nevertheless,
significant differences on structural properties and strict time-limit
constraints of real-world scenarios make LTSP challenging and interesting on
its own. In this work, we investigate several properties and algorithms for
LTSP and some of its extensions. The results allowed for the identification of
3-approximation algorithms for LTSP and efficient exact algorithms for some of
its special cases. We also show that LTSPR, the version of the problem with
heterogeneous release times for requests, is NP-complete. OLTSP, the online
extension of LTSPR, does not admit c-competitive algorithms for any constant
factor c, but we nevertheless introduce an algorithm for the problem and show
through extensive computational experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets that different embodiments of the proposed strategy are
computationally efficient and over-perform by orders of magnitude an algorithm
being currently used by real-world tape file systems.

group of objects or events that co-occur at many places. Extracting these
patterns from spatial data is very difficult due to the complexity of spatial
data types, spatial relationships, and spatial auto-correlation. These patterns
have applications in domains including public safety, geo-marketing, crime
prediction and ecology. Prior work focused on using the spatial join. While
these approaches provide state-of-the-art results, they are very expensive to
compute due to the multiway spatial join and scaling them to real-world
datasets is an open problem. We address these limitations by formulating the
co-location pattern discovery as a clique enumeration problem over a
neighborhood graph (which is materialized using a distributed graph database).
We propose three new traversal based algorithms, namely $CliqueEnum_G$,
$CliqueEnum_K$ and $CliqueExtend$. We provide the empirical evidence for the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms by evaluating them for a large
real-life dataset. The three algorithms allow for a trade-off between time and
memory requirements and support interactive data analysis without having to
recompute all the intermediate results. These attributes make our algorithms
applicable to a wide range of use cases for different data sizes.

consists of a cascade of nonlinear observer (NLO) and linearized Kalman filter

estimate that is used to generate a linearized model in the time-varying Kalman
filter algorithm. To demonstrate the proposed approach, we present a model of a
lithium-ion battery from an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The model has
linear process equations and a nonlinear output voltage equation. The method is
tested using experimental data of a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO$_4$) battery
under dynamic stress test (DST) and federal urban driving schedule (FUDS).
Effect on different ambient temperatures is also discussed. Compared with EKF

features in the spectra observed by these experiments. Using analytical
approximations and numerical modeling, the origin of the artifact and its
impact on the sky-averaged spectrum are described. The publicly released EDGES
dataset, from which a 78 MHz absorption feature was recently suggested, is used
to probe for the potential presence of ground plane resonances. While the lack
of a noise level for the EDGES spectrum makes traditional goodness-of-fit
statistics unattainable, the rms residual can be used to assess the relative
goodness of fits performed under similar circumstances. The fit to the EDGES
spectrum using a model with a simple 2-term foreground and three cavity-mode
resonances is compared to a fit to the same spectrum with a model used by the
EDGES team consisting of a 5-term foreground and a flattened Gaussian signal.
The fits with the physically motivated resonance and empirical flattened
Gaussian models have rms residuals of 20.8 mK (11 parameters) and 24.5 mK (9
parameters), respectively, allowing us to conclude that ground plane resonances
constitute another plausible explanation for the EDGES data.

estimator obtained via projection onto the space of functions monotone over a
finite grid in the domain. We demonstrate that this corrected estimator has no
worse supremal estimation error than the initial estimator, and that
analogously corrected confidence bands contain the true function whenever the
initial bands do, at no loss to average or maximal band width. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the corrected estimator is uniformly asymptotically equivalent
to the initial estimator provided that the initial estimator satisfies a
stochastic equicontinuity condition and that the true function is Lipschitz and
strictly monotone. We provide simple sufficient conditions for our stochastic
equicontinuity condition in the important special case that the initial
estimator is uniformly asymptotically linear, and illustrate the use of these
results for estimation of a G-computed distribution function. Our stochastic
equicontinuity condition is weaker than standard uniform stochastic
equicontinuity, which has been required for alternative correction procedures.
Crucially, this allows us to apply our results to the bivariate correction of
the local linear estimator of a conditional distribution function known to be
monotone in its conditioning argument. Our experiments suggest that the
projection step can yield significant practical improvements in performance for
both the estimator and confidence band.

We proposed a hierarchical system of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that
classifies automatically patches of these images into four pathologies: normal,
benign, in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma. We evaluated our system on
the BACH challenge dataset of image-wise classification and a small dataset
that we used to extend it. Using a train/test split of 75%/25%, we achieved an
accuracy rate of 0.99 on the test split for the BACH dataset and 0.96 on that

constructs distance sketches with worse stretch but that only takes
polylogarithmic rounds.
  Along the way, we show that other useful combinatorial structures can also be

weak confinements, multiple continuously nucleating and annihilating
topological defects self-organize into persistent circular flows of either
handedness. Increasing confinement strength leads to the emergence of distinct
dynamics, in which the slow periodic nucleation of topological defects at the
boundary is superimposed onto a fast procession of a pair of defects. A defect
pair migrates towards the confinement core over multiple rotation cycles, while
the associated nematic director field evolves from a distinct double spiral
towards a nearly circularly symmetric configuration. The collapse of the defect
orbits is punctuated by another boundary-localized nucleation event, that sets
up long-term doubly-periodic dynamics. Comparing experimental data to a
theoretical model of an active nematic, reveals that theory captures the fast
procession of a pair of $+\frac{1}{2}$ defects, but not the slow spiral
transformation nor the periodic nucleation of defect pairs. Theory also fails
to predict the emergence of circular flows in the weak confinement regime. The
developed confinement methods are generalized to more complex geometries,

itself to a variety of ways to increase photon yield and extend the harmonic
cut-off frequency. We show here that high-harmonic generation from an atom
confined inside an attractive potential shell can show a dramatic increase in
the photon yield in certain cases. We consider an endohedrally confined
hydrogen atom inside a C$_{60}$ cage as an example, and consider three distinct
physical situations in which the initial state is (1) entirely confined inside
the C$_{60}$, (2) partially outside, and (3) mainly localized on the cage wall.
We demonstrate that when the atom-cage system starts in a state with a
classical turning point outside the C$_{60}$ shell, the high-harmonic photon
yield can be enhanced up to 4 orders of magnitude when compared with a free
atom in the same initial state. We explain the underlying physical mechanisms
in each case using fully three-dimensional quantum simulations. This gives a
prime example of how directly coupling an atom to a nanostructure can alter
strong field processes in atoms in interesting ways.

chapter we offer further arguments for the importance of this identification by
discussing the philosophy, spirit, and practical application of conceptual
scaling to the discovery, conceptual analysis, interpretation, and
categorization of networked information resources. We argue that a linguistic
variable, which has been defined at just the right generalization of valuated
categories, provides a natural definition for the process of soft conceptual
scaling. This enrichment using valuated categories models the relation of
indiscernability, a notion of central importance in rough set theory. At a more
fundamental level for soft concept analysis, it also models the derivation of
formal concepts, a process of central importance in formal concept analysis.
Soft concept analysis is synonymous with enriched concept analysis. From one
viewpoint, the study of soft concept analysis that is initiated here extends
formal concept analysis to soft computational structures. From another
viewpoint, soft concept analysis provides a natural foundation for soft
computation by unifying and explaining notions from soft computation in terms
of suitably generalized notions from formal concept analysis, rough set theory

Existing methods for subtyping trajectories treat the evolution of clinical

intervals. In reality, diseases may have transient underlying states and a
state-dependent observation pattern. In our paper, we present an approach to
subtype irregular patient data while acknowledging the underlying progression
of disease states. Our approach consists of two components: a probabilistic
model to determine the likelihood of a patient's observation trajectory and a
mixture model to measure similarity between asynchronous patient trajectories.
We demonstrate our model by discovering subtypes of progression to hemodynamic
instability (requiring cardiovascular intervention) in a patient cohort from a
multi-institution ICU dataset. We find three primary patterns: two of which
show classic signs of decompensation (rising heart rate with dropping blood
pressure), with one of these showing a faster course of decompensation than the
other. The third pattern has transient period of low heart rate and blood
pressure. We also show that our model results in a 13% reduction in average
cross-entropy error compared to a model with no state progression when
forecasting vital signs.

lights. While solutions have been proposed to tackle subsets of the driving
anticipation tasks, by making use of diverse, task-specific sensors, there is
no single dataset or framework that addresses them all in a consistent manner.
In this paper, we therefore introduce a new, large-scale dataset, called
VIENA2, covering 5 generic driving scenarios, with a total of 25 distinct
action classes. It contains more than 15K full HD, 5s long videos acquired in
various driving conditions, weathers, daytimes and environments, complemented
with a common and realistic set of sensor measurements. This amounts to more
than 2.25M frames, each annotated with an action label, corresponding to 600
samples per action class. We discuss our data acquisition strategy and the
statistics of our dataset, and benchmark state-of-the-art action anticipation
techniques, including a new multi-modal LSTM architecture with an effective
loss function for action anticipation in driving scenarios.

term is added into the minimization mentioned above. The subproblem is
approximated by a proximal gradient method which is solved by the
shrinkage-threshold technique directly without iterations. In addition, a
modified Attouch-Peypouquet technique is used to accelerate the iterative
computation. These lead to more effective algorithms than the Wirtinger flow

analysis of both DC based algorithms shows that the iterative solutions is
convergent linearly to a critical point and will be closer to a global
minimizer than the given initial starting point. Our study is a deterministic
analysis while the study for the Wirtinger flow (WF) algorithm and its

retrieve solutions using a number $m$ of measurements which is about twice of

dimensionality reduction tools in data analysis. The PCA direction is a linear
combination of all features with nonzero loadings -- this impedes
interpretability. Sparse PCA (SPCA) is a framework that enhances
interpretability by incorporating an additional sparsity requirement in the
feature weights. However, unlike PCA, the SPCA problem is NP-hard. Most
conventional methods for solving SPCA are heuristics with no guarantees, such
as certificates of optimality on the solution-quality via associated dual
bounds. Dual bounds are available via standard semidefinite programming (SDP)
based relaxations, which may not be tight, and the SDPs are difficult to scale
by off-the-shelf solvers. In this paper, we present a convex integer
programming (IP) framework to derive dual bounds. At the heart of our approach
is the so-called $\ell_1$-relaxation of SPCA. While the $\ell_1$-relaxation
leads to convex optimization problems for $\ell_0$-sparse linear regression and
relatives, it results in a non-convex optimization problem for the PCA problem.
We first show that the $\ell_1$-relaxation gives a tight multiplicative bound
on SPCA. Then we show how to use standard integer programming techniques to
further relax the $\ell_1$-relaxation into a convex IP. We present worst-case
results on the quality of the dual bound from the convex IP. We observe that
the dual bounds are significantly better than worst-case performance and are
superior to the SDP bounds in some real-life instances. Moreover, solving the
convex IP model using commercial IP solvers appears to scale much better than
solving the SDP-relaxation using commercial solvers. To the best of our
knowledge, we obtain the best dual bounds for real and artificial instances for
SPCA problems involving covariance matrices of size up to $2000\times 2000$.

in reducing average consumption, the random responsiveness of consumers to
price event makes their efficiency questionable to achieve the flexibility
needed for electric systems with a large share of renewable energy. The
variance of consumers' responses depreciates the value of these mechanisms and
makes them weakly reliable. This paper aims at designing demand response
contracts which allow to act on both the average consumption and its variance.
The interaction between a risk--averse producer and a risk--averse consumer is
modelled through a Principal--Agent problem, thus accounting for the moral
hazard underlying demand response contracts. We provide closed--form solution
for the optimal contract in the case of constant marginal costs of energy and
volatility for the producer and constant marginal value of energy for the
consumer. We show that the optimal contract has a rebate form where the initial
condition of the consumption serves as a baseline. Further, the consumer cannot
manipulate the baseline at his own advantage. The second--best price for energy
and volatility are non--constant and non--increasing in time. The price for
energy is lower (resp. higher) than the marginal cost of energy during
peak--load (resp. off--peak) periods. We illustrate the potential benefit
issued from the implementation of an incentive mechanism on the responsiveness

predict a significant increase of responsiveness under our optimal contract and
a significant increase of the producer satisfaction.

weight, and demonstrate spintronic implementation of the excitatory/inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials and spike timing-dependent plasticity. This
functionality is made possible by the action of the in-plane interlayer
exchange coupling field which leads to broadened, multi-state magnetic reversal
characteristics. Numerical simulations, combined with investigations of a
reference sample with a single perpendicular magnetized Pt/FM1/Ta structure,
reveal that the broadening is due to the in-plane field component tuning the
efficiency of the spin-orbit-torque to drive domain walls across a landscape of
varying pinning potentials. The conventionally binary FM1 inside our
Pt/FM1/Ta/FM2 structure with inherent in-plane coupling field is therefore
tuned into a multi-state perpendicular ferromagnet and represents a synaptic
emulator for neuromorphic computing.

momentum sense on to a newly born neutron star in core collapse supernovae
(CCSNe) efficiently amplifies magnetic fields and by that launches jets. The
accretion flow of a collapsing core on to the newly born neutron star suffers
the spiral standing accretion shock instability (SASI). This instability leads
to a stochastically variable angular momentum of the accreted gas, that in turn
forms an accretion flow with alternating directions of the angular momentum,
hence alternating shear, at any given time. I study the shear in this
alternating-shear sub-Keplerian inflow in published simulations, and present a
new comparison with Keplerian accretion disks. From that comparison I argue
that it might be as efficient as Keplerian accretion disks in amplifying
magnetic fields by a dynamo. I suggest that although the average specific
angular momentum of the accretion flow is small, namely, sub-Keplerian, this
alternating-shear accretion flow can launch jets with varying directions,
namely, jittering jets. Neutrino heating is an important ingredients in further
energizing the jets. The jittering jets locally revive the stalled accretion
shock in the momentarily polar directions, and by that they explode the star. I
repeat again my call for a paradigm shift from a neutrino-driven explosion of
CCSNe to a jet-driven explosion mechanism that is aided by neutrino heating.

weights in the neural network. Thus, the attacker can effectively reverse
engineer the network using side-channel information.

an universal failure of DFT in the sense that many classic functionals like PBE

MS2. However, some other widely used functionals like B97-D (empirically
fitted) and TPSS (non-empirically constrained) predict qualitatively wrong
static polarizabilities, force constants and some even introduce an artificial
barrier against association of independent H atoms to form H$_2$. The
polarizability and force constant prediction failures appear to stem from
incomplete spin localization into individual H atoms beyond the Coulson-Fisher
point, resulting in `fractionally bonded' species where the ionic contributions
to the Slater determinant are not completely eliminated, unlike the case of
unrestricted Hartree-Fock. These errors therefore appear to be a consequence of
poor self-consistent density prediction by the problematic functional. The same
reasons could potentially lead to spurious barriers towards H atom association,
indirectly also leading to incorrect forces. These unphysicalities suggest that

minimum integration time of experience, the bursting neurons form synchrony
ensembles to allow for binding of related percepts. The degree which different
bursting neurons can be merged into the same synchrony ensemble depends on the
underlying cortical connections that represent the degree of perceptual
similarity. These synchrony ensembles compete for selective attention to remain
active. The dominant synchrony ensemble triggers episodic memory recall in the
hippocampus, while forming new episodic memory with current sensory stimuli,
resulting in a stream of thoughts. Neuromodulation modulates both top-down
selection of synchrony ensembles, and memory formation. Episodic memory stored
in the hippocampus is transferred to semantic and procedural memory in the
cortex during rapid eye movement sleep, by updating cortical neuron synaptic
weights with spike timing dependent plasticity. With the update of synaptic
weights, new neurons become bursting while previous bursting neurons become
tonic, allowing bursting neurons to move up to a higher level of perceptual
abstraction. Finally, the proposed learning mechanism is compared with the
back-propagation algorithm used in deep neural networks, and a proposal of how
the credit assignment problem can be addressed by the current proposal is
presented.

problems have long been an important research topic and a challenge especially
in market clearing computation. For large-scale SCUC, the Lagrangian relaxation
methods (LR) and the mixed integer programming methods (MIP) are most widely
adopted. However, LR usually suffers from slow convergence; and the
computational burden of MIP is heavy when the binary variable number is large.
In this paper, a variable reduction method is proposed: First, the time-coupled
constraints in the original SCUC problem are relaxed and many single-period
SCUC problems (s-UC) are obtained. Second, LR is used to solve the s-UCs.
Different from traditional LR with iterative subgradient method, it is found
that the optimal multipliers and the approximate UC solutions of s-UCs can be
obtained by solving linear programs. Third, a criterion for choosing and fixing
the UC variables in the SCUC problem is established, hence the number of binary
variables is reduced. Last, the SCUC with reduced binary variables is solved by
MIP solver to obtain the final UC solution. The proposed method is tested on
the IEEE 118-bus system and a 6484-bus system. The results show the method is
very efficient and effective.

contradiction to the model assumptions). In this context, we follow the
approach of Glasserman and Xu (2014) and use relative entropy as a pre-metric
in order to quantify these two sources of model risk in a common framework, and
consider the trade-offs between them when choosing a model and the frequency

the models of Black and Scholes (1973) and Heston (1993), using option data for
Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG). We find that recalibrating a model more
frequently simply shifts model risk from one type to another, without any
substantial reduction of aggregate model risk. Furthermore, moving to a more
complicated stochastic model is seen to be counterproductive if one requires a
high degree of robustness, for example as quantified by a 99 percent quantile

finite element and finite-difference time-domain methods. Recently, efforts
have been made on improving the prediction performance of the PCE-based model
and building efficiency by only selecting the influential basis polynomials

approach, named as resampled PCE (rPCE), to further optimize the selection by
making use of the knowledge that the true model is fixed despite the
statistical uncertainty inherent to sampling in the training. By simulating
data variation via resampling ($k$-fold division utilized here) and collecting
the selected polynomials with respect to all resamples, polynomials are ranked
mainly according to the selection frequency. The resampling scheme (the value
of $k$ here) matters much and various configurations are considered and
compared. The proposed resampled PCE is implemented with two popular selection
techniques, namely least angle regression and orthogonal matching pursuit, and
a combination thereof. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated on two analytical examples, a benchmark problem in structural
mechanics, as well as a realistic case study in computational dosimetry.

spectral measure is combined with the TVARX (time varying autoregressive with
exogenous input) modelling approach, which uses multiwavelets and ultra
regularized orthogonal least squares (UROLS) algorithm aided by APRESS
(adjustable prediction error sum of squares), to obtain high resolution time
varying CGC representations. The UROLS APRESS algorithm, which adopts both the
regularization technique and the ultra least squares criterion to measure not
only the signal data themselves but also the weak derivatives of them, is a
novel powerful method in constructing time varying models with good
generalization performance, and can accurately track smooth and fast changing

eliminate indirect influences in multivariate systems. Results: The proposed
method is validated on two simulations and then applied to multichannel motor

motion in micro- and macro- (or secular) motions and a statistical treatment of
hard-sphere collisions and ion trajectories. The model also relies on the
evidence that the effective trapping area in real Paul traps is limited to a
certain radius, where the harmonics of the potential of order >2 become non
negligible. The model yields analytical formulae for the properties of the ion
cloud and equilibration times, which are in good agreement for a wide range of
parameters with the results of a numerical simulation, whose reliability has
been verified with experimental observations. When the confining potential is
efficient enough to suppress evaporation from the trap, the model yields an
effective temperature for the ions T$_{eff}$=2T/(1-m$_{g}$/m), where T is the
temperature of the buffer gas, m and m$_{g}$ are the masses of the ions and gas
molecules respectively. The so-called rf heating effect, responsible for
T$_{eff}$>T, is interpreted in light of the model as the result of an
incomplete cooling of the ion motion, limited to the macromotion, while the net
effect of the micromotion is to double the average ion kinetic energy for
m/m$_{g}$ >>1. For m/m$_{g}$ <=1, the incomplete cooling is not sufficient to
overcome the thermal agitation of the cloud to which the micromotion
participates; the ions are therefore led out of the trap.

transition from the BCS pairing to over-damped phase, the uniform gauge may
enhance the pairing and will not induce to the over-damped phase. These result

a policy that optimizes the expected value of a performance metric such as the
infinite-horizon cumulative discounted or long-run average cost/reward. In
practice, optimizing the expected value alone may not be satisfactory, in that
it may be desirable to incorporate the notion of risk into the optimization
problem formulation, either in the objective or as a constraint. Various risk
measures have been proposed in the literature, e.g., exponential utility,
variance, percentile performance, chance constraints, value at risk (quantile),
conditional value-at-risk, prospect theory and its later enhancement,
cumulative prospect theory. In this book, we consider risk-sensitive RL in two
settings: one where the goal is to find a policy that optimizes the usual
expected value objective while ensuring that a risk constraint is satisfied,
and the other where the risk measure is the objective. We survey some of the
recent work in this area specifically where policy gradient search is the
solution approach. In the first risk-sensitive RL setting, we cover popular
risk measures based on variance, conditional value-at-risk, and chance
constraints, and present a template for policy gradient-based risk-sensitive RL
algorithms using a Lagrangian formulation. For the setting where risk is
incorporated directly into the objective function, we consider an exponential
utility formulation, cumulative prospect theory, and coherent risk measures.
This non-exhaustive survey aims to give a flavor of the challenges involved in
solving risk-sensitive RL problems using policy gradient methods, as well as
outlining some potential future research directions.

D-PMU enabled voltage angle droop control has the potential to enhance
stability and transient performance in such microgrid interconnections.
However, these angle droop control designs are vulnerable to D-PMU angle
measurement losses that frequently occur due to the unavailability of a GPS

droop controlled microgrid interconnections may suffer from poor performance
and potentially lose stability. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed

framework, when the D-PMU phase angle measurement is lost at a microgrid,
conventional frequency droop control is temporarily used for primary control in
place of angle droop control to guarantee stability. We model the microgrid
interconnection with this primary control architecture as a nonlinear switched
system and design distributed secondary controllers to guarantee transient
stability of the network. Further, we incorporate performance specifications
such as robustness to generation-load mismatch and network topology changes in
the distributed control design. We demonstrate the performance of this control

unsupervised anomaly detection in sound (ADS) using an autoencoder (AE). The
goal of unsupervised-ADS is to detect unknown anomalous sound without training
data of anomalous sound. Use of an AE as a normal model is a state-of-the-art
technique for unsupervised-ADS. To decrease the false positive rate (FPR), the
AE is trained to minimize the reconstruction error of normal sounds and the
anomaly score is calculated as the reconstruction error of the observed sound.
Unfortunately, since this training procedure does not take into account the
anomaly score for anomalous sounds, the true positive rate (TPR) does not
necessarily increase. In this study, we define an objective function based on
the Neyman-Pearson lemma by considering ADS as a statistical hypothesis test.
The proposed objective function trains the AE to maximize the TPR under an
arbitrary low FPR condition. To calculate the TPR in the objective function, we
consider that the set of anomalous sounds is the complementary set of normal
sounds and simulate anomalous sounds by using a rejection sampling algorithm.
Through experiments using synthetic data, we found that the proposed method
improved the performance measures of ADS under low FPR conditions. In addition,
we confirmed that the proposed method could detect anomalous sounds in real
environments.

a second-quantized boson scalar field. Recently the relation between the
integral kernel of the scattering matrix and the resonance in this model has
been established in [14] for the case of massless bosons. In the present work,
we treat the massive case. On the one hand, one might rightfully expect that
the massive case is easier to handle since, in contrast to the massless case,
the corresponding Hamiltonian features a spectral gap. On the other hand, it
turns out that the non-zero boson mass introduces a new complication as the
spectrum of the complex dilated, free Hamiltonian exhibits lines of spectrum
attached to every multiple of the boson rest mass energy starting from the
ground and excited state energies. This leads to an absence of decay of the
corresponding complex dilated resolvent close to the real line, which, in [14],
was a crucial ingredient to control the time evolution in the scattering
regime. With the new strategy presented here, we provide a proof of an
analogous formula for the scattering kernel as compared to the massless case
and use the opportunity to provide the required spectral information by a
Mourre theory argument combined with a suitable application of the
Feshbach-Schur map instead of complex dilation.

inputs that were drawn from a different distribution than that of the training

inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet wrong. Generative
models are widely viewed to be robust to such mistaken confidence as modeling
the density of the input features can be used to detect novel,
out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper we challenge this assumption. We find
that the density learned by flow-based models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot
distinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e.
CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning a higher
likelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former. Moreover, we
find evidence of this phenomenon when pairing several popular image data sets:
FashionMNIST vs MNIST, CelebA vs SVHN, ImageNet vs CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 / SVHN.
To investigate this curious behavior, we focus analysis on flow-based
generative models in particular since they are trained and evaluated via the
exact marginal likelihood. We find such behavior persists even when we restrict
the flows to constant-volume transformations. These transformations admit some
theoretical analysis, and we show that the difference in likelihoods can be
explained by the location and variances of the data and the model curvature.
Our results caution against using the density estimates from deep generative
models to identify inputs similar to the training distribution until their
behavior for out-of-distribution inputs is better understood.

enhancement to increase objective sound quality assessment (OSQA) scores such
as the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). In many conventional
studies, DNNs have been used as a mapping function to estimate time-frequency
masks and trained to minimize an analytically tractable objective function such
as the mean squared error (MSE). Since OSQA scores have been used widely for
sound-quality evaluation, constructing DNNs to increase OSQA scores would be
better than using the minimum-MSE to create high-quality output signals.
However, since most OSQA scores are not analytically tractable, \textit{i.e.},
they are black boxes, the gradient of the objective function cannot be
calculated by simply applying back-propagation. To calculate the gradient of
the OSQA-based objective function, we formulated a DNN optimization scheme on
the basis of \textit{black-box optimization}, which is used for training a
computer that plays a game. For a black-box-optimization scheme, we adopt the
policy gradient method for calculating the gradient on the basis of a sampling
algorithm. To simulate output signals using the sampling algorithm, DNNs are
used to estimate the probability density function of the output signals that
maximize OSQA scores. The OSQA scores are calculated from the simulated output
signals, and the DNNs are trained to increase the probability of generating the
simulated output signals that achieve high OSQA scores. Through several
experiments, we found that OSQA scores significantly increased by applying the
proposed method, even though the MSE was not minimized.

summarization algorithms are increasingly being used to provide users a quick
overview of the information content. Traditionally, summarization algorithms
have been evaluated only based on how well they match human-written summaries
(e.g. as measured by ROUGE scores). In this work, we propose to evaluate
summarization algorithms from a completely new perspective that is important
when the user-generated data to be summarized comes from different socially
salient user groups, e.g. men or women, Caucasians or African-Americans, or
different political groups (Republicans or Democrats). In such cases, we check
whether the generated summaries fairly represent these different social groups.
Specifically, considering that an extractive summarization algorithm selects a
subset of the textual units (e.g. microblogs) in the original data for
inclusion in the summary, we investigate whether this selection is fair or not.
Our experiments over real-world microblog datasets show that existing
summarization algorithms often represent the socially salient user-groups very
differently compared to their distributions in the original data. More
importantly, some groups are frequently under-represented in the generated
summaries, and hence get far less exposure than what they would have obtained
in the original data. To reduce such adverse impacts, we propose novel
fairness-preserving summarization algorithms which produce high-quality
summaries while ensuring fairness among various groups. To our knowledge, this
is the first attempt to produce fair text summarization, and is likely to open
up an interesting research direction.

artificial devices have been created which also generate motion by deforming

how a deforming helix can create a non-reciprocal translational and rotational
swimming stroke and identify its principle direction of motion. We then
determine the leading-order physics for helices with small helix radius before
considering the general behaviour for different configuration parameters and
how these swimmers can be optimised. Finally, we explore how the presence of
walls, gravity, and defects in the centreline allow the helical device to break
symmetries, increase its speed, and generate transport in directions not

arrhythmias. Although generally safe, it is not completely exempt from the risk
of complications. The great flexibility of computational models can be a major
asset in optimizing interventional strategies, if they can produce sufficiently
precise estimations of the generated lesion for a given ablation protocol. This
requires an accurate description of the catheter tip and the cardiac tissue. In
particular, the deformation of the tissue under the catheter pressure during
the ablation is an important aspect that is overlooked in the existing
literature, that resorts to a sharp insertion of the catheter into an
undeformed geometry. As the lesion size depends on the power dissipated in the
tissue, and the latter depends on the percentage of the electrode surface in
contact with the tissue itself, the sharp insertion geometry has the tendency
to overestimate the lesion obtained, especially when a larger force is applied
to the catheter. In this paper we introduce a full 3D computational model that
takes into account the tissue elasticity, and is able to capture the tissue
deformation and realistic power dissipation in the tissue. Numerical results in
FEniCS-HPC are provided to validate the model against experimental data, and to
compare the lesions obtained with the new model and with the classical ones

performance, privacy and aesthetics. Content blocking extensions typically rely
on filter lists to decide whether a web request is associated with tracking or
advertising, and so should be blocked. Millions of web users rely on filter
lists to protect their privacy and improve their browsing experience.
  Despite their importance, the growth and health of filter lists are poorly
understood. Filter lists are maintained by a small number of contributors, who
use a variety of undocumented heuristics to determine what rules should be
included. Lists quickly accumulate rules, and rules are rarely removed. As a
result, users' browsing experiences are degraded as the number of stale, dead
or otherwise not useful rules increasingly dwarf the number of useful rules,
with no attenuating benefit. An accumulation of ""dead weight"" rules also makes
it difficult to apply filter lists on resource-limited mobile devices.
  This paper improves the understanding of crowdsourced filter lists by
studying EasyList, the most popular filter list. We find that EasyList has
grown from several hundred rules, to well over 60,000 rules, during its 9-year
history. We measure how EasyList affects web browsing by applying EasyList to a

further use our changes in EasyList application rates to provide a taxonomy of
the ways advertisers evade EasyList rules. Finally, we propose optimizations
for popular ad-blocking tools, that allow EasyList to be applied on performance
constrained mobile devices, and improve desktop performance by 62.5%, while

plant tissues. Mathematical models describing the auxin-related signalling
pathway, PIN and AUX1 dynamics, auxin transport, and cell growth in plant
tissues are derived. A key assumption of our models is the regulation of PIN
proteins by the auxin-responsive ARF-Aux/IAA signalling pathway, with
upregulation of PIN biosynthesis by ARFs. Models are analysed and solved
numerically to examine the long-time behaviour and auxin distribution. Changes
in auxin-related signalling processes are shown to be able to trigger
transition between passage and spot type patterns in auxin distribution. The
model was also shown to be able to generate isolated cells with oscillatory

explain oscillations in levels of ARF targets that have been observed

the embedding with a fully data-driven manner. We analyze that the attention
mechanism actually takes effect in the latter case, and utilize the Graph
Attention Layer (GAL) for exploring on the most relevant attribute feature and
refining the task-dependant feature by considering other attributes.
Experiments show that by mining the correlations among attributes, our method
can improve the recognition accuracy on CelebA and LFWA dataset. And it also

dilemma regarding the desired objective. On one hand, a ""maximally separating""
solution, providing the minimal attainable Interference-to-Source-Ratio (ISR),
would often suffer from significant residual noise. On the other hand, optimal
Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimation would yield estimates which are the
""closest possible"" to the true sources, often at the cost of compromised ISR.
In this work, we consider noisy mixtures of temporally-diverse stationary
Gaussian sources in a semi-blind scenario, which conveniently lends itself to
either one of these objectives. We begin by deriving the ML Estimates (MLEs) of
the unknown (deterministic) parameters of the model: the mixing matrix and the
(possibly different) noise variances in each sensor. We derive the likelihood
equations for these parameters, as well as the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao lower
bound, and propose an iterative solution for obtaining the MLEs. Based on these
MLEs, the asymptotically-optimal ""maximally separating"" solution can be readily
obtained. However, we also present the ML-based MMSE estimate of the sources,
alongside a frequency-domain-based computationally efficient scheme, exploiting
their stationarity. We show that this estimate is asymptotically optimal and
attains the (oracle) MMSE lower bound. Furthermore, for non-Gaussian signals,
we show that this estimate serves as a Quasi ML (QML)-based Linear MMSE (LMMSE)
estimate, and attains the (oracle) LMMSE lower bound asymptotically. Empirical
results of three simulation experiments are presented, corroborating our
analytical derivations.

learning models to reduce the prediction error of sales volume. In this study
we construct two ensemble models for demand prediction with and without

the idea of censored quantile regression method where the model estimation is
splitted on two separate parts: a) prediction of zero sales by classification
model; and b) prediction of non-zero sales by regression model. Models with and
without accounting for censorship are based on the predictions aggregations of
Least squares, Ridge and Lasso regressions and Random Forest model. Having

preservation and inheritance of cultural heritage is conducive to the progress

Mogao Grottoes -- that has a plenty of mural paintings showing the historical
cultures of ancient China. To study these historical cultures, one critical
procedure is to date the mural paintings, i.e., determining the era when they
were created. Until now, most mural paintings at Mogao Grottoes have been dated
by directly referring to the mural texts or historical documents. However, some
are still left with creation-era undetermined due to the lack of reference
materials. Considering that the drawing style of mural paintings was changing
along the history and the drawing style can be learned and quantified through
painting data, we formulate the problem of mural-painting dating into a problem
of drawing-style classification. In fact, drawing styles can be expressed not
only in color or curvature, but also in some unknown forms -- the forms that
have not been observed. To this end, besides sophisticated color and shape
descriptors, a deep convolution neural network is designed to encode the
implicit drawing styles. 3860 mural paintings collected from 194 different
grottoes with determined creation-era labels are used to train the
classification model and build the dating method. In experiments, the proposed
dating method is applied to seven mural paintings which were previously dated
with controversies, and the exciting new dating results are approved by the
Dunhuang expert.

export the position, velocity and acceleration of our participants' centres of
mass to form a one-dimensional point mass model defined by the direction of
pushes. As a result, we find that proportional-derivative (PD) control can
describe the underlying control law that people used and different PD gains are
set for different phases of a push recovery trial within the scope of our
study. Our final PD control fittings have an average root mean square error
below 0.1m with above 90% of a trial's data points are taken into account on
average. We also explore how different error metrics that the PD control model
uses influence its performance but neither of the two metrics we proposed can
help improve the performance. Finally, we have statistics on how people switch
push recovery strategies based on their centre of mass properties at the start
of the push. We find that the further the centre of mass is from the
steady-state point and the higher the velocity it has, a person is more likely

velocity space, the full dynamics of classical particles in $1/r$ potentials.
States of given energy and angular momentum are represented by circular
hodographs whose radii depend only on the angular momentum, and hodographs
differing only in the energy are related by uniform translations. This feature
indicates the existence of an internal symmetry, named here after Hamilton. The
hodograph method and the Hamilton symmetry are extended here for relativistic
charged particles in a Coulomb field, on the relativistic velocity space which
is a 3D hyperboloid $H^3$ embedded in a 3+1 pseudo-Euclidean space.
  The key for the simplicity and elegance of the velocity-space method is the
linearity of the velocity equation, a unique feature of $1/r$ interactions for
Newtonian and relativistic systems alike. Although with hodographs much more
complicated than for Newtonian systems, the main features of the Hamilton
symmetry persist in the full relativistic picture : (1) general hodographs may
be represented as linearly displaced base energy-independent circles, (2)
hodographs corresponding to same angular momentum but with different energies
are connected via translations along geodesics of the velocity space. As an
internal symmetry over and beyond central symmetry, the Hamilton symmetry is
equivalent to the Laplace-Runge-Lenz symmetry and complements it.

properties. We precisely control the dimensions of quantum dots and their
position inside nanowires, and demonstrate that the emission wavelength can be
engineered over the range of at least $30\,nm$ around $765\,nm$. By applying an
external magnetic field we are able to fine tune the emission frequency of our
nanowire quantum dots to the $D_{2}$ transition of $^{87}$Rb. We use the Rb
transitions to precisely measure the actual spectral linewidth of the photons
emitted from a nanowire quantum dot to be $9.4 \pm 0.7 \mu eV$, under
non-resonant excitation. Our work brings highly-desirable functionalities to
quantum technologies, enabling, for instance, a realization of a quantum
network, based on an arbitrary number of nanowire single-photon sources, all
operating at the same frequency of an atomic transition.

When such transformations cannot be designed by hand, they can be learned, even
through plain backpropagation, for instance in attention mechanisms. However,
during learning, such sparse structures are often represented in a dense form,
as we do not know beforehand which elements will eventually become non-zero. We
introduce the adaptive, sparse hyperlayer, a method for learning a sparse
transformation, paramatrized sparsely: as index-tuples with associated values.
To overcome the lack of gradients from such a discrete structure, we introduce
a method of randomly sampling connections, and backpropagating over the
randomly wired computation graph. To show that this approach allows us to train
a model to competitive performance on real data, we use it to build two
architectures. First, an attention mechanism for visual classification. Second,
we implement a method for differentiable sorting: specifically, learning to
sort unlabeled MNIST digits, given only the correct order.

the generality, and relaxing these restrictions is the headline of a new
physical approach to cosmology that refurnishes the cosmological framework.
Considering a homogeneous geometry as a template geometry for the in reality

Unveiling the limitations of the standard model opens the door to rich
consequences of general relativity, giving rise to effective (i.e. spatially

of dark energy and dark matter. We explore in this talk the influence of
structure formation on average properties of the Universe by discussing: (i)
general thoughts on why considering average properties, on the key-issue of

setting, the pathologist will often almost arbitrarily choose a certain field
of interest assumed to have the highest mitotic activity. However, as mitotic
figures are commonly very sparse on the slide and often have a patchy
distribution, this poses a sampling problem which is known to be able to
influence the tumor prognostication. On the other hand, automatic detection of
mitotic figures can't yet be considered reliable enough for clinical
application. In order to aid the work of the human expert and at the same time
reduce variance in tumor grading, it is beneficial to assess the whole slide
image (WSI) for the highest mitotic activity and use this as a reference region
for human counting. For this task, we compare two methods for region of
interest proposal, both based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). For both
approaches, the CNN performs a segmentation of the WSI to assess mitotic
activity. The first method performs a segmentation at the original image
resolution, while the second approach performs a segmentation operation at a
significantly reduced resolution, cutting down on processing complexity. We
evaluate the approach using a dataset of 32 completely annotated whole slide

network and 10 for test. Our results indicate that, while the overall
correlation to the ground truth mitotic activity is considerably higher (0.94

change quickly. This makes it hard to learn abstract representations of mutual
interplay between agents. To tackle these difficulties, we propose graph
convolutional reinforcement learning, where graph convolution adapts to the
dynamics of the underlying graph of the multi-agent environment, and relation
kernels capture the interplay between agents by their relation representations.
Latent features produced by convolutional layers from gradually increased
receptive fields are exploited to learn cooperation, and cooperation is further
improved by temporal relation regularization for consistency. Empirically, we
show that our method substantially outperforms existing methods in a variety of
cooperative scenarios.

ability to identify, track and trace elements of a product as it moves in the
supply chain is deemed necessary, and for many industries is even mandated by
national or international regulations. Traceability presupposes the integrity
and transparency of data that is saved and shared. This is a problem for
current technologies, as there are many examples with tampered data and
database vulnerabilities that resulted in serious implications and data loss. A
solution to this problem can be the decentralization of the system, which will
remove the central point of failure. To that effect, blockchain or DLT
technologies, an emergent technology that enables the decentralization of a
network can be used, by implementing a trustless model to achieve it.
Blockchains are tamperproof and transparent, which means that by exploiting
blockchain characteristics, traceability can be improved. A model that
describes the decentralization process of the supply chain traceability part
has been developed for this paper and is later evaluated and compared with the
traditional system.

were located approximately 90 degrees apart from each other in 2011-2012, and
thus gave a 360 degree view to the Sun. The radio data was compared to
white-light and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of flares, EUV waves,
and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in five solar events. We find that the reason
for observing compact and intense DH type IV burst emission from only one
spacecraft at a time is due to the absorption of emission to one direction and
that the emission is blocked by the solar disk and dense corona to the other
direction. The geometry also makes it possible to observe metric type IV bursts
in the low corona from a direction where the higher-located DH type IV emission
is not detectable. In the absorbed direction we found streamers present, and
these were estimated to be the locations of type II bursts, caused by shocks at
the CME flanks. The high-density plasma was therefore most probably formed by
shock--streamer interaction. In some cases the type II-emitting region was also
capable of stopping later-accelerated electron beams, visible as type III

finding is unexpected and striking and is based on a model independent analysis
of experimental mass distributions (cumulative yields) at various excitations
from about 23 to 66 MeV in the alpha induced fission of 232Th. It has been
found that the observed asymmetry in the mass distributions and the unusually
narrow peak in the symmetry region, can both be explained in a consistent
manner if one assumes: a) multi-chance fission, b) bi-modal fission at lower
excitations (9 < E* < 25 MeV) for all the Uranium nuclei in the range A = 230
to 236, and c) that the shell effects get washed out completely beyond about 25
MeV of excitation resulting in symmetric fission. The analysis has allowed a
quantitative estimation of the percentages of the asymmetric and the symmetric
component in the bi-modal fission. It has been found that the bi-modal fission
in Uranium nuclei is predominantly asymmetric (~ 85%), which contributes in a
major way to the observed asymmetric peaks, while the ~15% bi-modal symmetric
fission is primarily responsible for the observed narrow symmetric peak in the
mass distributions. The unusually narrow symmetry peak in the mass
distributions indicates that the symmetric bi-modal fission in Uranium nuclei
must have proceeded from a configuration at the bi-modal symmetric saddle that
is highly deformed with a well-developed neck.

second-order derivatives of a linear finite element function by a least-squares
fitting recovery procedure. The intrinsic link between the second-order

is studied in the paper. In particular, for the first time, we discover that
the Laplace recovery scheme is exactly the well-known five-point stencil over
uniform meshes. The proposed discretization for the Cahn-Hilliard equation can
be regarded as a combination of the finite difference scheme and the finite
element scheme. In addition, special considerations are put on different
methods for imposing Neumann type boundary conditions.

were involved to detected for the first time the $b-$type rotational spectrum
of HSCO$^+$, and to extend, well into the sub-millimeter region, the $a-$type
spectrum of the same molecular species and DSCO$^+$. The electronic
ground-state of both ions have been investigated in the 273-405 GHz frequency

Use of an effective wavevector in a quantum-mechanical theory unites the

circular dichroism (NCD) is derived from electric dipole - magnetic dipole

for the user because NCD and MCD are otherwise precisely the same as for a
circularly polarized beam, according to our calculations. Our analysis shows

system operators have to deal with higher degrees of uncertainty due to
forecast errors and variability in renewable energy production. Second, with
abundant potential of renewable generation in remote locations, there is an
increasing interest in the use of High Voltage Direct Current lines (HVDC) to
increase transmission capacity. These HVDC transmission lines and the
flexibility and controllability they offer must be incorporated effectively and
safely into the system. In this work, we introduce an optimization tool that
addresses both challenges by incorporating the full AC power flow equations,
chance constraints to address the uncertainty of renewable infeed, modelling of
point-to-point HVDC lines, and optimized corrective control policies to model
the generator and HVDC response to uncertainty. The main contributions are
twofold. First, we introduce a HVDC line model and the corresponding HVDC
participation factors in a chance-constrained AC-OPF framework. Second, we
modify an existing algorithm for solving the chance-constrained AC-OPF to allow
for optimization of the generation and HVDC participation factors. Using
realistic wind forecast data, for 10 and IEEE 39 bus systems with HVDC lines

polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The two dominant
effects for astrophysical halos are Faraday rotation generating rotation of the
plane of linear polarization, and Faraday conversion inducing a leakage from
linear polarization to circular polarization. We revisit these sources of
secondary anisotropies by computing the angular power spectra of the Faraday
rotation angle and of the Faraday conversion rate by the large scale
structures. To this end, we use the halo model and we pay special attention to
the impact of magnetic field projections. Assuming magnetic fields of halos to
be uncorrelated, we found a vanishing 2-halo term, and angular power spectra
peaking at multipoles $\ell\sim10^4$. The Faraday rotation angle is dominated
by the contribution of thermal electrons. For the Faraday conversion rate, we
found that both thermal electrons and relativistic, non-thermal electrons
contribute equally in the most optimistic case for the density and Lorentz
factor of relativistic electrons, while in more pessimistic cases the thermal
electrons give the dominant contribution. Assuming the magnetic field to be
independent of the halo mass, the angular power spectra for both effects
roughly scale with the amplitude of matter perturbations as $\sim\sigma_8^3$,
and with a very mild dependence with the density of cold dark matter.
Introducing a dependence of the magnetic field strength with the halo mass
leads to an increase of the scaling with the amplitude of matter fluctuations,
up to $\sim\sigma_8^{9.5}$ for Faraday rotation and $\sim\sigma_8^{15}$ for
Faraday conversion for a magnetic field strength scaling linearly with the halo
mass.

have been considered to realize and probe these intriguing phases, ultracold
atoms become promising platforms due to their high flexibility and
controllability. Quantum simulation of topological phases with cold atomic
gases is a rapidly evolving field, and recent theoretical and experimental
developments reveal that some toy models originally proposed in condensed
matter physics have been realized with this artificial quantum system. The
purpose of this article is to introduce these developments. The article begins
with a tutorial review of topological invariants and the methods to control
parameters in the Hamiltonians of neutral atoms. Next, topological quantum
phases in optical lattices are introduced in some detail, especially several
celebrated models, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the
Hofstadter-Harper model, the Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model. The
theoretical proposals and experimental implementations of these models are
discussed. Notably, many of these models cannot be directly realized in
conventional solid-state experiments. The newly developed methods for probing
the intrinsic properties of the topological phases in cold atom systems are
also reviewed. Finally, some topological phases with cold atoms in the
continuum and in the presence of interactions are discussed, and an outlook on
future work is given.

points, various nodal lines and surfaces, and recently novel quantum states in
non-Hermitian systems have been arousing widespread research interests. In
contrast to Hermitian systems whose bulk nodal points must form closed
manifolds, it is fascinating to find that for non-Hermitian systems exotic
nodal manifolds can be bounded by exceptional points in the bulk band
structure. Such exceptional points, at which energy bands coalesce with band
conservation violated, are iconic for non-Hermitian systems. In this work, we
show that a variety of nodal lines and drumheads with exceptional boundary can
be realized on 2D and 3D honeycomb lattices through natural and physically
feasible non-Hermitian processes. The bulk nodal Fermi-arc and drumhead states,
although is analogous to, but should be essentially distinguished from the
surface counterpart of Weyl and nodal-line semimetals, respectively, for which
surface nodal-manifold bands eventually sink into bulk bands. Then we
rigorously examine the bulk-boundary correspondence of these exotic states with
open boundary condition, and find that these exotic bulk states are thereby
undermined, showing the essential importance of periodic boundary condition for
the existence of these exotic states. As periodic boundary condition is
non-realistic for real materials, we furthermore propose a practically feasible
electrical-circuit simulation, with non-Hermitian devices implemented by
ordinary operational amplifiers, to emulate these extraordinary states.

(1968), a consistent subset of $P$, is a set $S\subseteq P$ such that for every
point $p$ in $P\setminus S$, the closest point of $p$ in $S$ has the same color
as $p$. The consistent subset problem is to find a consistent subset of $P$
with minimum cardinality. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for
two-colored point sets. Since the initial presentation of this problem, aside
from the hardness results, there has not been a significant progress from the
algorithmic point of view. In this paper we present the following algorithmic
results:
  1. The first subexponential-time algorithm for the consistent subset problem.
  2. An $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm that finds a consistent subset of size two
in two-colored point sets (if such a subset exists). Towards our proof of this
running time we present a deterministic $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for
computing a variant of the compact Voronoi diagram; this improves the
previously claimed expected running time.
  3. An $O(n\log^2 n)$-time algorithm that finds a minimum consistent subset in
two-colored point sets where one color class contains exactly one point; this
improves the previous best known $O(n^2)$ running time which is due to Wilfong
(SoCG 1991).
  4. An $O(n)$-time algorithm for the consistent subset problem on collinear
points; this improves the previous best known $O(n^2)$ running time.
  5. A non-trivial $O(n^6)$-time dynamic programming algorithm for the
consistent subset problem on points arranged on two parallel lines.
  To obtain these results, we combine tools from planar separators,
additively-weighted Voronoi diagrams with respect to convex distance functions,
point location in farthest-point Voronoi diagrams, range trees, paraboloid
lifting, minimum covering of a circle with arcs, and several geometric
transformations.

direction indicates that this galaxy is undergoing a ram pressure stripping
event. The deep narrow-band image revealed the presence of a low surface
brightness ionised gas tail ~10 kpc long extending from the centre of the
galaxy to the NW direction, in the direction opposite to the HI tail. Chandra
and XMM X-rays data do not show any compact source in the nucleus nor the
presence of an extended tail of hot gas, while MUSE spectroscopy indicates that
the gas is photo-ionised in the inner regions and shock-ionised in the outer
parts. IFU spectroscopy confirms that the ionised gas is kinematically
decoupled from the stellar component and indicates the presence of two
kinematically distinct structures in the stellar disc. The analysis of the SED
of the galaxy indicates that the activity of star formation has been totally
quenched in the outer disc ~ 250-280 Myr ago, while only reduced by ~80% in the
central regions. All this observational evidence suggests that NGC 4424 is the
remnant of an unequal-mass merger occurred <= 500 Myr ago, when the galaxy was
already a member of the Virgo cluster, now undergoing a ram pressure stripping
event which has removed the gas and quenched the activity of star formation in
the outer disc. The tail of ionised gas probably results from the outflow
produced by a central starburst fed by the collapse of gas induced by the
merging episode. This outflow is sufficiently powerful to overcome the ram
pressure induced by the intracluster medium on the disc of the galaxy crossing
the cluster. This analysis thus suggests that feedback can participate in the
quenching process of galaxies in high-density regions.

demonstrating social intelligence. In order to be acceptable, they must exhibit
socio-communicative skills. Classic approaches to program HRI from observed
human-human interactions fails to capture the subtlety of multimodal
interactions as well as the key structural differences between robots and
humans. The former arises due to a difficulty in quantifying and coding
multimodal behaviours, while the latter due to a difference of the degrees of
liberty between a robot and a human. However, the notion of reverse engineering
from multimodal HRI traces to learn the underlying behavioral blueprint of the
robot given multimodal traces seems an option worth exploring. With this
spirit, the entire HRI can be seen as a sequence of exchanges of speech acts
between the robot and human, each act treated as an action, bearing in mind
that the entire sequence is goal-driven. Thus, this entire interaction can be
treated as a sequence of actions propelling the interaction from its initial to
goal state, also known as a plan in the domain of AI planning. In the same
domain, this action sequence that stems from plan execution can be represented
as a trace. AI techniques, such as machine learning, can be used to learn
behavioral models (also known as symbolic action models in AI), intended to be
reusable for AI planning, from the aforementioned multimodal traces. This
article reviews recent machine learning techniques for learning planning action
models which can be applied to the field of HRI with the intent of rendering
robots as socio-communicative.

binaries of W UMa and $\beta$ Lyr types. The period changes with time. The
reason for steady changes of the period could be the mass transfer (the flow of
matter) between components of these stellar systems. For ZZ Cas the changes of
the period are cyclic caused by the presence of the hypothetical third
component (either a small star or a large planet). The cyclic changes of the
period for AH Tau superimpose on steady ones (the period decrease) indicating
for a third component and mass transfer. The third components do not take part
in the eclipses. However, due to their gravity, they make the visible close
binary systems rotate and become closer or further to an observer, causing the
Light-Time Effect (LTE). Generally, an orbit of a third component is not a
circle, but an ellipse and it is inclined relatively to the observer's line of
sight. Using the O-C curve, we estimated the parameters of a third component's
orbit, such as a semi-major axis, an eccentricity, angles of orientation and a
period of a third component's rotation. We elaborated a modeling program using

basic structure. Natural selection increases information in the same way that
Bayesian updating increases information. Thermodynamics and the forms of common
probability distributions express maximum increase in entropy, which appears
mathematically as loss of information. Physical mechanics follows paths of
change that maximize Fisher information. The information expressions typically
have analogous interpretations as the Newtonian balance between force and
acceleration, representing a partition between direct causes of change and
opposing changes in the frame of reference. This web of vague analogies hints
at a deeper common mathematical structure. I suggest that the Price equation
expresses that underlying universal structure. The abstract Price equation
describes dynamics as the change between two sets. One component of dynamics
expresses the change in the frequency of things, holding constant the values
associated with things. The other component of dynamics expresses the change in
the values of things, holding constant the frequency of things. The separation
of frequency from value generalizes Shannon's separation of the frequency of
symbols from the meaning of symbols in information theory. The Price equation's
generalized separation of frequency and value reveals a few simple invariances
that define universal geometric aspects of change. For example, the
conservation of total frequency, although a trivial invariance by itself,
creates a powerful constraint on the geometry of change. That constraint plus a
few others seem to explain the common structural forms of the equations in
different disciplines. From that abstract perspective, interpretations such as
selection, information, entropy, force, acceleration, and physical work arise
from the same underlying geometry expressed by the Price equation.

  Quantization and Statistical Inference",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonlinearity is crucial to the performance of a deep (neural) network (DN).
To date there has been little progress understanding the menagerie of available
nonlinearities, but recently progress has been made on understanding the r\^ole
played by piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities like the ReLU and absolute
value activation functions and max-pooling. In particular, DN layers
constructed from these operations can be interpreted as {\em max-affine spline
operators} (MASOs) that have an elegant link to vector quantization (VQ) and
$K$-means. While this is good theoretical progress, the entire MASO approach is
predicated on the requirement that the nonlinearities be piecewise affine and
convex, which precludes important activation functions like the sigmoid,
hyperbolic tangent, and softmax. {\em This paper extends the MASO framework to
these and an infinitely large class of new nonlinearities by linking
deterministic MASOs with probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).} We show
that, under a GMM, piecewise affine, convex nonlinearities like ReLU, absolute
value, and max-pooling can be interpreted as solutions to certain natural
""hard"" VQ inference problems, while sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softmax
can be interpreted as solutions to corresponding ""soft"" VQ inference problems.
We further extend the framework by hybridizing the hard and soft VQ
optimizations to create a $\beta$-VQ inference that interpolates between hard,
soft, and linear VQ inference. A prime example of a $\beta$-VQ DN nonlinearity
is the {\em swish} nonlinearity, which offers state-of-the-art performance in a
range of computer vision tasks but was developed ad hoc by experimentation.
Finally, we validate with experiments an important assertion of our theory,
namely that DN performance can be significantly improved by enforcing
orthogonality in its linear filters.

players select a color they induce a $k$-coloring or simply a coloring. Given a
coloring, the \emph{utility} (or \emph{payoff}) of a player $u$ is the sum of
the weights of the edges $\{u,v\}$ incident to $u$, such that the color chosen
by $u$ is different from the one chosen by $v$. Such games form some of the
basic payoff structures in game theory, model lots of real-world scenarios with
selfish agents and extend or are related to several fundamental classes of
games.
  Very little is known about the existence of strong equilibria in max $k$-cut
games. In this paper we make some steps forward in the comprehension of it. We
first show that improving deviations performed by minimal coalitions can cycle,
and thus answering negatively the open problem proposed in
\cite{DBLP:conf/tamc/GourvesM10}. Next, we turn our attention to unweighted
graphs. We first show that any optimal coloring is a 5-SE in this case. Then,
we introduce $x$-local strong equilibria, namely colorings that are resilient
to deviations by coalitions such that the maximum distance between every pair
of nodes in the coalition is at most $x$. We prove that $1$-local strong
equilibria always exist. Finally, we show the existence of strong Nash
equilibria in several interesting specific scenarios.

implemented different types of astrocytes network topologies including shortcut

designed and evaluated a single-hop communication system with frequency

lower level oscillations of Alzheimer's astrocyte networks can create a
multi-scale effect on communication between astrocytes with increased molecular

phase-field theory is proposed for simulating axisymmetric multiphase flows.
The most striking feature of the model is that it enables to handle multiphase
flows with large density ratio, which are unavailable in all previous
axisymmetric LB models. The present model utilizes two LB evolution equations,
one of which is used to solve fluid interface, and another is adopted to solve
hydrodynamic properties. To simulate axisymmetric multiphase flows effectively,
the appropriate source term and equilibrium distribution function are
introduced into the LB equation for interface tracking, and simultaneously, a
simple and efficient forcing distribution function is also delicately designed
in the LB equation for hydrodynamic properties. Unlike many existing LB models,
the source and forcing terms of the model arising from the axisymmetric effect
include no additional gradients, and consequently, the present model contains
only one non-local phase field variable, which in this regard is much simpler.
We further conducted the Chapman-Enskog analysis to demonstrate the
consistencies of our present MRT-LB model with the axisymmetric Allen-Cahn
equation and hydrodynamic equations. A series of numerical examples, including
static droplet, oscillation of a viscous droplet, breakup of a liquid thread,
and bubble rising in a continuous phase, are used to test the performance of
the proposed model. It is found that the present model can generate relatively
small spurious velocities and can capture interfacial dynamics with higher
accuracy than the previously improved axisymmetric LB model. Besides, it is
also found that our present numerical results show excellent agreement with
analytical solutions or available experimental data for a wide range of density
ratios, which highlights the strengths of the proposed model.

distributed databases and blockchains. Canopus is a scalable distributed
consensus protocol that ensures that live nodes in a system agree on an ordered
sequence of operations (called transactions). Unlike most prior consensus
protocols, Canopus does not rely on a single leader. Instead, it uses a virtual
tree overlay for message dissemination to limit network traffic across
oversubscribed links. It leverages hardware redundancies, both within a rack
and inside the network fabric, to reduce both protocol complexity and
communication overhead. These design decisions enable Canopus to support large
deployments without significant performance degradation.
  The existing Canopus protocol is resilient in the face of node and
communication failures, but its focus is primarily on performance, so does not
respond well to other types of failures. For example, the failure of a single
rack of servers causes all live nodes to stall. The protocol is also open to
attack by Byzantine nodes, which can cause different live nodes to conclude the
protocol with different transaction orders. In this paper, we describe RCanopus
(`resilent Canopus') which extends Canopus to add liveness, that is, allowing
live nodes to make progress, when possible, despite many types of failures.
This requires RCanopus to accurately detect and recover from failure despite
using unreliable failure detectors, and tolerance of Byzantine attacks. Second,
RCanopus guarantees safety, that is, agreement amongst live nodes of
transaction order, in the presence of Byzantine attacks and network
partitioning.

hardening of both the primary (proton, helium, carbon, oxygen, and the primary

boron and the secondary component of nitrogen) cosmic ray (CR) nuclei. With the
diffusion-reacceleration model, we consider two schemes to reproduce the
hardening in the spectra: (i) A high-rigidity break in primary source
injection; (ii) A high-rigidity break in diffusion coefficient. The global
fitting results show that both schemes could reproduce the spectra hardening in
current status. More precise multi-TV data (especially the data of secondary CR
species) is needed if one wants to distinguish these two schemes. In our global
fitting, each of the nuclei species is allocated an independent solar
modulation potential and a re-scale factor (which accounts for the isotopic
abundance for primary nuclei species and uncertainties of production cross
section or inhomogeneity of CR sources and propagation for secondary nuclei
species). The fitting values of these two parameter classes show us some hints
on some new directions in CR physics. All the fitted re-scale factors of
primary nuclei species have values that systematically smaller than 1.0, while
that of secondary nuclei species are systematically larger than 1.0. Moreover,
both the re-scale factor and solar modulation potential of beryllium have
values which are obviously different from other species. This might indicate
that beryllium has the specificity not only on its propagation in the
heliosphere, but also on its production cross section. All these new results
should be seriously studied in the future.

are known, which differ on how they handle redundancies possibly caused by the
introduction of nulls. Given a chase variant, the halting problem takes as
input a set of existential rules and asks if this set of rules ensures the
termination of the chase for any factbase. It is well-known that this problem
is undecidable for all known chase variants. The related problem of boundedness
asks if a given set of existential rules is bounded, i.e., whether there is a
predefined upper bound on the number of (breadth-first) steps of the chase,
independently from any factbase. This problem is already undecidable in the
specific case of datalog rules. However, knowing that a set of rules is bounded
for some chase variant does not help much in practice if the bound is unknown.
Hence, in this paper, we investigate the decidability of the k-boundedness
problem, which asks whether a given set of rules is bounded by an integer k. We
prove that k-boundedness is decidable for three chase variants, namely the
oblivious, semi-oblivious and restricted chase.

the modular theory defines a positive operator known as the relative modular
operator that decreases monotonically under restriction to subregions. We study
the consequences of this operator monotonicity inequality for correlation
functions in quantum field theory. We do so by constructing a one-parameter
Renyi family of information-theoretic measures from the relative modular
operator that inherit monotonicity by construction and reduce to correlation
functions in special cases. In the case of finite quantum systems, this Renyi
family is the sandwiched Renyi divergence and we obtain a new simple proof of
its monotonicity. Its monotonicity implies a class of constraints on
correlation functions in quantum field theory, only a small set of which were
known to us. We explore these inequalities for free fields and conformal field
theory. We conjecture that the second null derivative of Renyi divergence is
non-negative which is a generalization of the quantum null energy condition to
the Renyi family.

Intensities are computed using wavefunctions generated from an \ai\ and our

as analogs to high-redshift star-forming galaxies, possibly responsible for the
cosmic reionization. Despite the intensive studies of Green Peas in the
ultraviolet and optical domains, their X-ray properties have only so far been
probed by nearby analogs. In this paper, we present the first measurements of
Green Peas in the X-ray domain to constrain their spectral properties and
fluxes at high energies. We analyzed XMM-Newton observations of three Green Pea
sources. For two of them, we found an X-ray luminosity exceeding by a
half-order of magnitude its predicted value, derived from the star formation
rate and metallicity. Only an upper limit of the X-ray luminosity was derived
for the third studied galaxy. Our results thus indicate that at least some
Green Peas produce copious amounts of highly energetic photons, larger than
detected in other star-forming galaxies. We discuss possible physical scenarios
for the measured X-ray excess, including the presence of a hidden active
galactic nucleus, a larger population of X-ray binaries, or ultra-luminous
X-ray sources. Future spatially resolved X-ray images will discriminate between
the models. Larger Green Pea samples will provide a possible link between the
X-ray properties and the leaking ultraviolet radiation.

difficult to measure, yet they are a crucial ingredient in the stars'

rates in young, rapidly-rotating stars. These stars are known to support
systems of ""slingshot prominences"" fed by hot wind material flowing up from the
stellar surface into the summits of closed magnetic loop structures. The
material gathers and cools near the co-rotation radius until its density
becomes large enough that it is visible as a transient absorption feature in
the hydrogen Balmer lines and strong resonance lines such as Ca II H \&\ K.
Here we present the key insight that the sonic point usually lies well below
the condensation region. The flow at the wind base is therefore unaffected by
the presence of an overlying prominence, so we can use the observed masses and
recurrence times of the condensations to estimate the mass flux in the wind.
These measurements extend the relationship between mass loss rate per unit
surface area and X-ray flux to span 5 orders of magnitude. They demonstrate no
evidence of the suspected weakening of stellar mass loss rates at high X-ray

Combining GOES-16/SUVI and SDO/AIA EUV imagery, we identify a hot ($T\approx
10-15$ MK) bright rim around a quickly expanding cavity, embedded inside a much
larger CME shell ($T\approx 1-2$ MK). The CME shell develops from a dense set
of large AR loops ($\gtrsim$0.5 $R_s$), and seamlessly evolves into the CME
front observed in LASCO C2. The strong lateral overexpansion of the CME shell
acts as a piston initiating the fast EUV wave. The hot cavity rim is
demonstrated to be a manifestation of the dominantly poloidal flux and
frozen-in plasma added to the rising flux rope by magnetic reconnection in the
current sheet beneath. The same structure is later observed as the core of the
white light CME, challenging the traditional interpretation of the CME
three-part morphology. The large amount of added magnetic flux suggested by
these observations explains the extreme accelerations of the radial and lateral
expansion of the CME shell and cavity, all reaching values of $5 - 10$ km
s$^{-2}$. The acceleration peaks occur simultaneously with the first RHESSI
$100-300$ keV hard X-ray burst of the associated flare, further underlining the
importance of the reconnection process for the impulsive CME evolution.
Finally, the much higher radial propagation speed of the flux rope in relation
to the CME shell causes a distinct deformation of the white light CME front and

Network Group (GONG) time series for harmonic degrees $l=0 - 150$. We correct
for the effect of fill factor, apparent solar radius, and spurious jumps in the

degree. As a function of mode frequency, the mode amplitudes are found to
follow an asymmetric Voigt profile with
$\nu_{\text{max}}=3073.59\pm0.18\,\mu\text{Hz}$. From the mode parameters, we
calculate physical mode quantities and average them over specific mode

activity, varying by $14.7\pm0.3\%$ and $18.4\pm0.3\%$, respectively, and that
the mode energy supply rates show no significant correlation with activity.
With this study we expand previously published results on the temporal
variation of solar p-mode parameters. Our results will be helpful to future
studies of the excitation and damping of p modes, i.e., the interplay between
convection, magnetic field, and resonant acoustic oscillations.

dust particles over a surface (wall) in an inverse sheath are reported. It is
shown that under suitable parameter regime, the ion-drag force may balance the
combined electrostatic and gravitational force on the dust particles owing to
its hollow profile as one moves away from the surface. Our analysis shows that
the parameter regimes in which such a situation may result is realizable in
laboratory and space plasma environments, particularly the near-surface dayside
lunar plasma. The lunar surface and dust grains are electrostatically charged
due to the interaction with the solar wind plasma environment and the
photoemission of electrons due to solar UV radiation. This results in a process
that charges the surface positively and generates a near-surface photoelectron
inverse plasma sheath. The potential structure changes from a monotonic
classical sheath to an inverse sheath as the emitted electron density becomes
larger than the plasma electron density. In a relatively newer, recently
developed charging model, called the Patched Charge Model, it has shown both
theoretically and experimentally that even in photoelectron-rich environment,
dust particles lying on a regolith surface can attain large negative potential
due to formation of micro cavities. This negative potential may reach such
values so that dust mobilization and lofting may become possible. In our work,
we have assumed the existence of such negatively charged dust particles in a
photoelectron-rich environment and argue that once the dust lofting is
effected, the levitation can be sustained through the ion-drag force. The
conditions of levitation are investigated for these dust particles and the
levitation distances from the lunar surface are calculated.

efficiency for such problems has been theoretically confirmed in

dimension $n$, constructed by a certain greedy strategy, has approximation
error similar to that of the optimal space associated to the Kolmogorov
$n$-width of the solution manifold. The greedy construction of the reduced
basis space is performed in an offline stage which requires at each step a
maximization of the current error over the parameter space. For the purpose of
numerical computation, this maximization is performed over a finite {\em
training set} obtained through a discretization. of the parameter domain. To
guarantee a final approximation error $\varepsilon$ for the space generated by
the greedy algorithm requires in principle that the snapshots associated to
this training set constitute an approximation net for the solution manifold

the $\varepsilon$ covering number for $\mathcal{M}$ and this covering number
typically behaves like $\exp(C\varepsilon^{-1/s})$ for some $C>0$ when the

a large class of relevant problems one may replace the fine discretization by a
random training set of size polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$. Our proof of this

Generalizing the theory of semirings we aim at represent quantum structures,
such as basic algebras and orthomodular lattices, in terms of near semirings
with involution. In particular, after discussing several properties of near
semirings, we introduce the so-called \L ukasiewicz near semirings, as a
particular case of near semirings, and we show that every basic algebra is
representable as (precisely, it is term equivalent to) a near semiring. In the
particular case in which a \L ukasiewicz near semiring is also a semiring, we
obtain as a corollary a representation of MV-algebras as semirings.
Analogously, by introducing a particular subclass of \L ukasiewicz near
semirings, that we termed orthomodular near semirings, we obtain a
representation of orthomodular lattices. In the second part of the paper, we
discuss several universal algebraic properties of \L ukasiewicz near semirings
and we show that the variety of involutive integral near semirings is a Church
variety. This yields a neat equational characterization of central elements of
this variety. As a byproduct of such, we obtain several direct decomposition
theorems for this class of algebras.

correlations agree well with the theoretical expectations, given by the sum of
super-sample and intra-sample lensing terms, with only a typically negligible
$\sim$ 5% discrepancy in the amplitude of the super-sample lensing effect.
Including these effects we find that lensing constraints are in $3.0\sigma$ or
$2.1\sigma$ tension between the SPT polarization measurements and Planck
temperature or lensing reconstruction constraints respectively. If the
lensing-induced covariance effects are neglected, the significance of these
tensions increases to $3.5\sigma$ or $2.5\sigma$. Using the standard scaling
parameter $A_L$ substantially underestimates the significance of the tension
once other parameters are marginalized over. By parameterizing the super-sample
lensing through the mean convergence in the SPT footprint, we find a hint of
underdensity in the SPT region. We also constrain extra sharpening of the CMB
acoustic peaks due to missing smoothing of the peaks by super-sample lenses at
a level that is much smaller than the lens sample variance. Finally, we extend
the usual ""shift in the means"" statistic for evaluating tensions to
non-Gaussian posteriors, generalize an approach to extract correlation modes
from noisy simulated covariance matrices, and present a treatment of
correlation modes not as data covariances but as auxiliary model parameters.

expensive pattern matching capabilities. Answering optional query clauses in
SPARQL for instance renders the query evaluation problem immediately
Pspace-complete. Therefore, light-weight graph pattern matching relations, such
as simulation, have recently been investigated as promising alternatives to
more expensive query mechanisms like, e.g., computing subgraph isomorphism.
Still, graph pattern matching alone lacks expressive query capabilities: all
patterns are combined by usual join constructs, where more sophisticated
capabilities would be inevitable for making solutions useful to emerging
applications. In this paper we bridge this gap by introducing a new dual
simulation process operating on SPARQL queries. In addition to supporting the
full syntactic structure of SPARQL queries, it features polynomial-time pattern
matching to compute an overapproximation of query results from the database.
Moreover, to achieve runtimes competing with state-of-the-art database systems,
we develop a novel algorithmic solution to dual simulation graph pattern
matching, based on a system of inequalities that allows for several
optimization heuristics. Finally, we achieve soundness of our process for
SPARQL queries including UNION, AND and OPTIONAL operators not restricted to
well-designed patterns. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world graph data

origami that strikes a balance between these two criteria by representing these
systems on a lattice at the level of binding domains. The free energy of
hybridization between individual binding domains is estimated with a
nearest-neighbour model. Double helical segments are treated as rigid rods, but
we allow flexibility at points where the backbone of one of the strands is
interrupted, which provides a reasonably realistic representation of partially
and fully assembled states. Particular attention is paid to the constraints
imposed by the double helical twist, as they determine where strand crossovers
between adjacent helices can occur. To improve the efficiency of sampling
configuration space, we develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling scaffold
conformations in near-assembled states, and we carry out simulations in the
grand canonical ensemble, enabling us to avoid considering states with unbound
staples. We demonstrate that our model can quickly sample assembled
configurations of a small origami design previously studied with the oxDNA
model, as well as a design with staples that span longer segments of the
scaffold. The sampling ability of our method should allow for good statistics
to be obtained when studying the assembly pathways, and is suited to
investigating in particular the effects of design and assembly conditions on

vertical magnetic field component $B_\text{ver}$ averaged along the umbral
boundary is found to be independent of sunspot size. The authors of that study
conclude that the absolute value of $B_\text{ver}$ at the umbral boundary is
the same for all spots.
  Aims. We investigate the temporal evolution of $B_\text{ver}$ averaged along
the umbral boundary of one long-lived sunspot during its stable phase.
  Methods. We analysed data from the HMI instrument on-board SDO. Contours of
continuum intensity at $I_\text{c}=0.5I_\text{qs}$, whereby $I_\text{qs}$
refers to the average over the quiet sun areas, are used to extract the
magnetic field along the umbral boundary. Projection effects due to different
formation heights of the Fe I 617.3 nm line and continuum are taken into
account. To avoid limb artefacts, the spot is only analysed for heliocentric
angles smaller than $60^{\circ}$.
  Results. During the first disc passage, NOAA AR 11591, $B_\text{ver}$ remains
constant at 1693 G with a root-mean-square deviation of 15 G, whereas the
magnetic field strength varies substantially (mean 2171 G, rms of 48 G) and
shows a long term variation. Compensating for formation height has little
influence on the mean value along each contour, but reduces the variations
along the contour when away from disc centre, yielding a better match between
the contours of $B_\text{ver}=1693$ G and $I_\text{c}=0.5I_\text{qs}$.
  Conclusions. During the disc passage of a stable sunspot, its umbral boundary
can equivalently be defined by using the continuum intensity $I_\text{c}$ or
the vertical magnetic field component $B_\text{ver}$. Contours of fixed
magnetic field strength fail to outline the umbral boundary.

  Transactions",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Synchronous Mirroring (SM) is a standard approach to building
highly-available and fault-tolerant enterprise storage systems. SM ensures
strong data consistency by maintaining multiple exact data replicas and
synchronously propagating every update to all of them. Such strong consistency
provides fault tolerance guarantees and a simple programming model coveted by
enterprise system designers. For current storage devices, SM comes at modest
performance overheads. This is because performing both local and remote updates
simultaneously is only marginally slower than performing just local updates,
due to the relatively slow performance of accesses to storage in today's
systems. However, emerging persistent memory and ultra-low-latency network
technologies necessitate a careful re-evaluation of the existing SM techniques,
as these technologies present fundamentally different latency characteristics
compared than their traditional counterparts. In addition to that, existing
low-latency network technologies, such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA),
provide limited ordering guarantees and do not provide durability guarantees
necessary for SM. To evaluate the performance implications of RDMA-based SM, we
develop a rigorous testing framework that is based on emulated persistent
memory. Our testing framework makes use of two different tools: (i) a
configurable microbenchmark and (ii) a modified version of the WHISPER
benchmark suite, which comprises a set of common cloud applications. Using this
framework, we find that recently proposed RDMA primitives, such as remote
commit, provide correctness guarantees, but do not take full advantage of the
asynchronous nature of RDMA hardware. To this end, we propose new primitives
enabling efficient and correct SM over RDMA, and use these primitives to
develop two new techniques delivering high-performance SM of persistent
memories.

for implementing new optimizers and objective functions. Implementation of a
new optimizer requires only one method and a new objective function requires
typically one or two C++ functions. This can aid in the quick implementation

template metaprogramming, ensmallen is able to support compiler optimizations

FWHM(MgII) and EW(MgII). This correlation is entirely driven by the choice of
the continuum used to measure EW(MgII). If we correct for the strong curvature
in the UV continuum related to the character of emission expected from

behaviour of H$\beta$. Such a similarity is expected since both lines belong to
the Low Ionization group of emission lines and come from a similar region. Such
a similarity and weak coupling between FWHM and EW of the corresponding line is
then also consistent with the Broad Line Region model based on the presence of

new notion of bubble network that represents discrete 3d space geometries.
These are natural extensions of twisted geometries, which represent the
geometrical data underlying loop quantum geometry and are defined as networks
of SU(2) holonomies. In addition to the SU(2) representations encoding the
geometrical flux, the bubble network links carry a compatible SL(2,R)
representation encoding the discretized frame field which composes the flux. In
contrast with twisted geometries, this extra data allows to reconstruct the
frame compatible with the flux unambiguously. At the classical level this data
represents a network of 3d geometrical cells glued together. The SL(2,R) data
contains information about the discretized 2d metrics of the interfaces between
3d cells and SL(2,R) local transformations are understood as the group of
area-preserving diffeomorphisms. We further show that the natural gluing
condition with respect to this extended group structure ensures that the
intrinsic 2d geometry of a boundary surface is the same from the viewpoint of
the two cells sharing it. At the quantum level this gluing corresponds to a
maximal entanglement along the network edges. We emphasize that the nature of
this extension of twisted geometries is compatible with the general analysis of
gauge theories that predicts edge mode degrees of freedom at the interface of
subsystems.

Multi-socket systems built from these processors are used for running various
server applications. However to the best of our knowledge current commercial
operating systems are not optimized for multi-threaded workloads running on
such servers. Cache-to-cache transfers and remote memory accesses impact the
performance of such workloads. This paper presents a unified approach to
optimizing OS scheduling algorithms for both cache-to-cache transfers and
remote DRAM accesses that also takes cache affinity into account. By observing
the patterns of local and remote cache-to-cache transfers as well as local and
remote DRAM accesses for every thread in each scheduling quantum and applying
different algorithms, we come up with a new schedule of threads for the next
quantum taking cache affinity into account. This new schedule cuts down both
remote cache-to-cache transfers and remote DRAM accesses for the next
scheduling quantum and improves overall performance. We present two algorithms
of varying complexity for optimizing cache-to-cache transfers. One of these is
a new algorithm which is relatively simpler and performs better when combined
with algorithms that optimize remote DRAM accesses. For optimizing remote DRAM
accesses we present two algorithms. Though both algorithms differ in
algorithmic complexity we find that for our workloads they perform equally
well. We used three different synthetic workloads to evaluate these algorithms.
We also performed sensitivity analysis with respect to varying remote
cache-to-cache transfer latency and remote DRAM latency. We show that these
algorithms can cut down overall latency by up to 16.79% depending on the
algorithm used.

for the Biot system modeling coupled flow and deformation in heterogeneous
poroelastic media. The algorithm first solves the flow subproblem on a fine
grid using a mixed finite element method (by freezing a certain measure of the
mean stress) followed by the poromechanics subproblem on a coarse grid using a
conforming Galerkin method. Restriction operators map the fine scale flow
solution to the coarse scale poromechanical grid and prolongation operators map
the coarse scale poromechanical solution to the fine scale flow grid. The
coupling iterations are repeated until convergence and Backward Euler is
employed for time marching. The analysis is based on studying the equations
satisfied by the difference of iterates to show that the two-grid scheme is a
contraction map under certain conditions. Those conditions are used to
construct the restriction and prolongation operators as well as arrive at
coarse scale elastic properties in terms of the fine scale data. We show that
the adjustable parameter in the measure of the mean stress is linked to the
Voigt and Reuss bounds frequently encountered in computational homogenization
of multiphase composites.

recently, due to their effectiveness in processing high-dimensional data such

representation classification (SRC) approach is proposed; it is then applied to
the problem of online process monitoring of human workers, specifically manual
material handling (MMH) operations monitored using wearable sensors (involving
111 sensor channels). Our proposed method optimizes the design matrix (aka
dictionary) in the linear model used for SRC, minimizing its ill-posedness to
achieve a sparse solution. This procedure is based on the idea of dictionary
learning (DL): we optimize the design matrix formed by training datasets to
minimize both redundancy and coherency as well as reducing the size of these
datasets. Use of such optimized training data can subsequently improve
classification accuracy and help decrease the computational time needed for the
SRC; it is thus more applicable for online process monitoring. Performance of
the proposed methodology is demonstrated using wearable sensor data obtained
from manual material handling experiments, and is found to be superior to those
of benchmark methods in terms of accuracy, while also requiring computational
time appropriate for MMH online monitoring.

Villamizar, Acosta and Dastrup [J. Comput. Phys. 333 (2017) 331] . They are
derived from exact Farfield Expansions representations of the outgoing waves in
the exterior of the regions enclosed by the artificial boundary. As a
consequence, the error due to the ABC on the artificial boundary can be reduced
conveniently such that the dominant error comes from the volume discretization
method used in the interior of the computational domain. Reciprocally, the
error in the interior can be made as small as the error at the artificial
boundary by appropriate implementation of {\it p-} and {\it h}- refinement. We
apply this novel method to cylindrical, spherical and arbitrary shape
scatterers including a prototype submarine. Our numerical results exhibits
spectral-like approximation and high order convergence rate. Additionally, they
show that the proposed method can reduce both the pollution and artificial

have developed a highly accurate computational platform to numerically solve

Under some general conditions, we show that this transition is sharp for the

not encountered during training since the number of constraints to satisfy is
too small to hamper minimization. Our findings support a link between this
transition and the generalization properties of the network: as we increase the
number of parameters of a given model, starting from an under-parametrized
network, we observe that the generalization error displays three phases: (i)
initial decay, (ii) increase until the transition point --- where it displays a
cusp --- and (iii) slow decay toward a constant for the rest of the
over-parametrized regime. Thereby we identify the region where the classical
phenomenon of over-fitting takes place, and the region where the model keeps
improving, in line with previous empirical observations for modern neural
networks.

the electric power grid. A sudden failure of a power transformer can
significantly disrupt bulk power delivery. Before a transformer reaches its
critical failure state, there are indicators which, if monitored periodically,
can alert an operator that the transformer is heading towards a failure. One of
the indicators is the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the voltage and current
signals in substations located in the vicinity of the transformer. During
normal operations, the width of the SNR band is small. However, when the
transformer heads towards a failure, the widths of the bands increase, reaching
their maximum just before the failure actually occurs. This change in width of
the SNR can be observed by sensors, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs)
located nearby. Identifying Code is a mathematical tool that enables one to
uniquely identify one or more {\em objects of interest}, by generating a unique
signature corresponding to those objects, which can then be detected by a
sensor. In this paper, we first describe how Identifying Code can be utilized
for detecting failure of power transformers. Then, we apply this technique to

brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to nonstationarity of perceptual decision
processes. This paper presents a novel boosted convolutional neural networks
(ConvNets) decoding scheme for motor imagery (MI) EEG signals assisted by the
multiwavelet-based time-frequency (TF) causality analysis. Specifically,
multiwavelet basis functions are first combined with Geweke spectral measure to
obtain high-resolution TF-conditional Granger causality (CGC) representations,
where a regularized orthogonal forward regression (ROFR) algorithm is adopted
to detect a parsimonious model with good generalization performance. The
causality images for network input preserving time, frequency and location
information of connectivity are then designed based on the TF-CGC distributions
of alpha band multichannel EEG signals. Further constructed boosted ConvNets by
using spatio-temporal convolutions as well as advances in deep learning
including cropping and boosting methods, to extract discriminative causality
features and classify MI tasks. Our proposed approach outperforms the
competition winner algorithm with 12.15% increase in average accuracy and
74.02% decrease in associated inter subject standard deviation for the same
binary classification on BCI competition-IV dataset-IIa. Experiment results
indicate that the boosted ConvNets with causality images works well in decoding
MI-EEG signals and provides a promising framework for developing MI-BCI
systems.

mitigate this problem, we propose an implicit IVIM signal acquisition model

that agenda-planning and committed jumps are clear advantages in the real-time

challenge for artificial intelligence. In such contexts, agents must constantly

this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a novel planning approach,
called Moving Goal Planning (MGP), to adapt plans to goal evolutions. This
planning algorithm draws inspiration from Moving Target Search (MTS)
algorithms. In order to limit the number of search iterations and to improve
its efficiency, MGP delays as much as possible triggering new searches when the
goal changes over time. To this purpose, MGP uses two strategies: Open Check
(OC) that checks if the new goal is still in the current search tree and Plan
Follow (PF) that estimates whether executing actions of the current plan brings
MGP closer to the new goal. Moreover, MGP uses a parsimonious strategy to
update incrementally the search tree at each new search that reduces the number
of calls to the heuristic function and speeds up the search. Finally, we show
evaluation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

act and make decisions based on their perceptions of the environment. Among
these techniques, HTN ({\it Hierarchical Task Network}) planning is one of the
most used in practice. Unlike classical approaches of planning. HTN operates by
decomposing task into sub-tasks until each of these sub-tasks can be achieved
an action. This hierarchical representation provide a richer representation of
planning problems and allows to better guide the plan search and provides more
knowledge to the underlying algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new
approach of HTN planning in which, as in conventional planning, we instantiate
all planning operators before starting the search process. This approach has
proven its effectiveness in classical planning and is necessary for the
development of effective heuristics and encoding planning problems in other
formalism such as CSP or SAT. The instantiation is actually used by most modern
planners but has never been applied in an HTN based planning framework. We
present in this article a generic instantiation algorithm which implements many
simplification techniques to reduce the process complexity inspired from those
used in classical planning. Finally we present some results obtained from an
experimentation on a range of problems used in the international planning
competitions with a modified version of SHOP planner using fully instantiated
problems.

acquire MRI signal from tissues with very short transverse relaxation time.
Since transmit power is many orders of magnitude larger than receive signal, a
weak coupling dominates the MR signal during CEA. Thus, appropriate decoupling
between transmit and receive coils is required. In this study, two controllable
decoupling designs are investigated for achieving isolation between coils.
Methods: A modified version of isolation concept used in the full-duplex radios
in communication systems is applied to acquire MRI signal using CEA. In our new
method, a small copy of RF transmit signal is attenuated and delayed to
generate the same coupling signal which is available in the receiver coil. Then
it is subtracted from the receive signal to detect the MRI signal. The proposed
decoupling method is developed and implemented in two designs: Semi-Automatic
and Fully-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Designs. Results: Using
Semi-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Design, decoupling of more than 75 dB is
achieved. Fully-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Design provides more than 100
dB decoupling between coils which is good enough for detecting MRI signals
during excitation from tissues with very short transverse relaxation time.
Conclusion: This study shows feasibility of applying full duplex electronics to
decouple transmit and receive coils for CEA in a clinical MRI system.
Significance: These designs can automatically tune the cancellation circuit and
it is a potential tool for recovering signal from tissues with very short T2 in
clinical MR systems with a minor hardware modification.

each student has ranked a fixed number of projects in order of preference. Each
project is offered by a specific supervisor (or supervisors), and the goal is
to find an optimal matching of students to projects taking into account the
students' preferences, the constraint that only one student can be assigned to
a given project, and the constraint that supervisors have a maximum workload.
We show that when applied to a real dataset from a university physics
department, simulated annealing allows the rapid determination of high quality
solutions to this allocation problem. The quality of the solution is quantified
by a satisfaction metric derived from empirical student survey data. Our
approach provides high quality allocations in a matter of minutes that are as
good as those found previously by the course organizer using a laborious
trial-and-error approach. We investigate how the quality of the allocation is
affected by the ratio of the number of projects offered to the number of
students and the number of projects ranked by each student. We briefly discuss
how our approach can be generalized to include other types of constraints and
discuss its potential applicability to wider allocation problems.

exhibited by the average trading volume-as well as the volatility of the price
fluctuations-experienced a significant change from 2008 (the year of the
sub-prime financial crisis) onwards. That has resulted in a faster relaxation
after the market opening and relates to a consistent decrease in the convexity
of the average trading volume intraday profile. Simultaneously, the last part
of the session has become steeper as well, a modification that is likely to
have been triggered by the new short-selling rules that were introduced in 2007
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The combination of both results
reveals that the has been turning into a t. Additionally, the analysis of
higher-order cumulants namely the skewness and the kurtosis-shows that the
morning and the afternoon parts of the trading session are each clearly
associated with different statistical features and hence dynamical rules.
Concretely, we claim that the large initial trading volume is due to wayward
stocks whereas the large volume during the last part of the session hinges on a
cohesive increase of the trading volume. That dissimilarity between the two
