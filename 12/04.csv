magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium. In this configuration the magnetic forces are
balanced by a pressure force caused by a toroidal depression in the pressure.
Equilibrium is attained when this low pressure region prevents further
expansion into the higher-pressure external plasma. We find that, for the
parameters investigated, the resistive evolution of the structures follows a
universal pattern when rescaled to resistive time. The finite resistivity
causes both a decrease in the magnetic field strength and a finite slip of the
plasma fluid against the static equilibrium. This slip is caused by a
Pfirsch-Schl\""uter type diffusion, similar to what is seen in tokamak
equilibria. The net effect is that the configuration remains in Magnetostatic
equilibrium whilst it slowly grows in size. The rotational transform of the
structure becomes nearly constant throughout the entire structure, and
decreases according to a power law. In simulations this equilibrium is observed
when highly tangled field lines relax in a high-pressure (relative to the
magnetic field strength) environment, a situation that occurs when the twisted
field of a coronal loop is ejected into the interplanetary solar wind. In this
paper we relate this localized MHD equilibrium to magnetic clouds in the solar
wind.

iteration for discounted Markov decision processes whose transition and reward
can only be sampled through a generative model. Given such a problem with
$|\mathcal{S}|$ states, $|\mathcal{A}|$ actions, and a discounted factor
$\gamma\in(0,1)$, AsyncQVI uses memory of size $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{S}|)$ and
returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with probability at least $1-\delta$
using
$$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{(1-\gamma)^5\varepsilon^2}\log(\frac{1}{\delta})\big)$$
samples. AsyncQVI is also the first asynchronous-parallel algorithm for
discounted Markov decision processes that has a sample complexity, which nearly
matches the theoretical lower bound. The relatively low memory footprint and
parallel ability make AsyncQVI suitable for large-scale applications. In
numerical tests, we compare AsyncQVI with four sample-based value iteration
methods. The results show that our algorithm is highly efficient and achieves
linear parallel speedup.

their use in security-sensitive domains. A plethora of interpretation models
have been proposed to help users understand the inner workings of DNNs: how
does a DNN arrive at a specific decision for a given input? The improved
interpretability is believed to offer a sense of security by involving human in
the decision-making process. Yet, due to its data-driven nature, the
interpretability itself is potentially susceptible to malicious manipulations,
about which little is known thus far.
  Here we bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on the
security of interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes). We show that existing
\imlses are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations. Specifically, we
present ADV^2, a new class of attacks that generate adversarial inputs not only
misleading target DNNs but also deceiving their coupled interpretation models.
Through empirical evaluation against four major types of IDLSes on benchmark
datasets and in security-critical applications (e.g., skin cancer diagnosis),
we demonstrate that with ADV^2 the adversary is able to arbitrarily designate
an input's prediction and interpretation. Further, with both analytical and
empirical evidence, we identify the prediction-interpretation gap as one root
cause of this vulnerability -- a DNN and its interpretation model are often
misaligned, resulting in the possibility of exploiting both models
simultaneously. Finally, we explore potential countermeasures against ADV^2,
including leveraging its low transferability and incorporating it in an
adversarial training framework. Our findings shed light on designing and
operating IDLSes in a more secure and informative fashion, leading to several
promising research directions.

resonances arise when multiple bound states in the continuum - each carrying a
topological charge - merge in the momentum space and enhance the quality
factors of all resonances nearby. We experimentally achieve quality factors as
high as $4.9\times 10^5$ based on these resonances in the telecommunication

learning domain-invariant embedddings. However, these methods only focus on
aligning the whole data distributions, without considering the class-level
relations among source and target images. Thus, a target embeddings of a bird
might be aligned to source embeddings of an airplane. This semantic
misalignment can directly degrade the classifier performance on the target
dataset. To alleviate this problem, we present a similarity constrained
alignment (SCA) method for unsupervised domain adaptation. When aligning the
distributions in the embedding space, SCA enforces a similarity-preserving
constraint to maintain class-level relations among the source and target
images, i.e., if a source image and a target image are of the same class label,
their corresponding embeddings are supposed to be aligned nearby, and vise
versa. In the absence of target labels, we assign pseudo labels for target
images. Given labeled source images and pseudo-labeled target images, the
similarity-preserving constraint can be implemented by minimizing the triplet

bi-component magnonic superlattice are theoretically studied. The magnonic
superlattice can be seen as a periodic array of nanostripes, where stripes with
different width, termed as defect stripes, are periodically introduced. By
controlling the geometry of the defect stripes, a transition from dispersive to
practically flat spin-wave defect modes can be observed inside the magnonic
band gaps. It is shown that the spin-wave profile of the defect modes can be
either symmetric or antisymmetric, depending on the geometry of the defect. Due
to the localized character of the defect modes, a particular magnonic
superlattice is proposed, wherein the excitation of either symmetric or
antisymmetric flat magnonic modes is enabled at the same time. Also, it is
demonstrated that the relative frequency position of the antisymmetric mode
inside the band gap does not significantly change with the application of an
external field, while the symmetric modes move to the edges of the frequency
band gaps. The results are complemented by numerical simulations, where an
excellent agreement is observed between both methods. The proposed theory
allows exploring different ways to control the dynamic properties of the defect
modes in metamaterial magnonic superlattices, which can be useful for
applications on multifunctional microwave devices operating over a broad
frequency range.

our agent's stochastic policy is shown to more accurately capture the diversity

et al., but there are limited results on non-Gaussian models with non-quadratic
distortion measures. In this work, we extend the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem
to two non-Gaussian settings with general $r$th power of difference distortion.
Assuming an identical observation channel across agents, we study the
asymptotics of distortion decay as the number of agents and sum-rate,
$R_{sum}$, grow without bound, while individual rates vanish. The first setting
is a regular source-observation model with $r$th power of difference
distortion, which subsumes the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem, and we establish
that the distortion decays at $\mathcal{O}(R_{sum}^{-r/2})$ when $r \ge 2$. We
use sample median estimation after the Berger-Tung scheme for achievability.
The other setting is a \emph{non-regular} source-observation model, including
uniform additive noise models, with $r$th power of difference distortion for
which estimation-theoretic regularity conditions do not hold. The distortion
decay $\mathcal{O}(R_{sum}^{-r})$ when $r \ge 1$ is obtained for the
non-regular model by midrange estimator following the Berger-Tung scheme. We
also provide converses based on the Shannon lower bound for the regular model
and the Chazan-Zakai-Ziv bound for the non-regular model, respectively. Lastly,
we provide a sufficient condition for the regular model, under which quadratic
and logarithmic distortions are asymptotically equivalent by an entropy power
relationship as the number of agents grows. This proof relies on the
Bernstein-von Mises theorem.

particularly challenging, even in the unrealistic case that an agent's policy
can be made conditional upon all other agents' observations. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient
algorithm enhanced by a communication medium (MADDPG-M), which implements a
two-level, concurrent learning mechanism. An agent's policy depends on its own
private observations as well as those explicitly shared by others through a
communication medium. At any given point in time, an agent must decide whether
its private observations are sufficiently informative to be shared with others.
However, our environments provide no explicit feedback informing an agent
whether a communication action is beneficial, rather the communication policies
must also be learned through experience concurrently to the main policies. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in six highly

popular assisted history matching method. In its standard form, the method
requires the specification of the number of iterations in advance. If the
selected number of iterations is not enough, the entire data assimilation must
be restarted. Moreover, ES-MDA also requires the selection of data-error
covariance inflations. The typical choice is to select constant values.
However, previous works indicate that starting with large inflation and
gradually decreasing during the data assimilation steps may improve the quality
of the final models.
  This paper presents an analysis of the use of geometrically decreasing
sequences of the data-error covariance inflations. In particular, the paper
investigates a recently introduced procedure based on the singular values of a
sensitivity matrix computed from the prior ensemble. The paper also introduces
a novel procedure to select the inflation factors. The performance of the data
assimilation schemes is evaluated in three reservoir history-matching problems
with increasing level of complexity. The first problem is a small synthetic
case which illustrates that the standard ES-MDA scheme with constant inflation
may result in overcorrection of the permeability field and that a geometric
sequence can alleviate this problem. The second problem is a recently published
benchmark and the third one is a field case with real production data. The data
assimilation schemes are compared in terms of a data-mismatch and a
model-change norm. The first norm evaluates the ability of the models to
reproduce the observed data. The second norm evaluates the amount of changes in
the prior model. The results indicate that geometric inflations can generate
solutions with good balance between the two norms.

methods have overlooked pixel appearance transformations, focusing instead on
bootstrapping and/or domain confusion losses. We propose a Semantic Pixel-Level
Adaptation Transform (SPLAT) approach to detector adaptation that efficiently
generates cross-domain image pairs. Our model uses aligned-pair and/or
pseudo-label losses to adapt an object detector to the target domain, and can
learn transformations with or without densely labeled data in the source (e.g.
semantic segmentation annotations). Without dense labels, as is the case when
only detection labels are available in the source, transformations are learned
using CycleGAN alignment. Otherwise, when dense labels are available we
introduce a more efficient cycle-free method, which exploits pixel-level
semantic labels to condition the training of the transformation network. The
end task is then trained using detection box labels from the source,
potentially including labels inferred on unlabeled source data. We show both
that pixel-level transforms outperform prior approaches to detector domain
adaptation, and that our cycle-free method outperforms prior models for
unconstrained cycle-based learning of generic transformations while running 3.8
times faster. Our combined model improves on prior detection baselines by 12.5

suppressed by a combination of dispersion in time and entanglement in time. The
approach here has no free parameters; it is therefore falsifiable. As it treats
time and space with complete symmetry and does not suffer from the ultraviolet

requirements for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are built upon. The
choice between same-filter nightly pairs or different-filter nightly pairs in
the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) Survey will have a dramatic effect on the ability of
the Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS) to detect certain classes of Solar
System objects; many of the possible filter pairings would result in
significant ($\sim50\%$ or more) loss of Solar System object detections. In
particular, outer Solar System populations can be significantly redder than
those in the inner Solar System, and nightly pairs in $r$-band will result in
the deepest survey for the outer Solar System. To maximize the potential for
outer Solar System science, we thus advocate for ensuring that the WFD survey
contains a sufficient number of $r$-$r$ nightly pairs for each field during a
discovery season to ensure detection and linking using MOPS. We also advocate
for adding additional spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that more accurately
model outer Solar System populations to the pipeline for evaluating the outputs
of the LSST operations simulator. This will enable a better estimate of how
many Solar System population detections are lost or gained for different filter
choices in the WFD survey.

privacy of a local obfuscation mechanism means that the attacker cannot

input distributions in terms of distribution privacy, while deteriorating the
utility by adding too much noise. For example, we prove that the Laplace
mechanism needs to add a large amount of noise proportionally to the infinite
Wasserstein distance between the two distributions we want to make
indistinguishable. To improve the tradeoff between distribution privacy and
utility, we introduce a local obfuscation mechanism, called a tupling
mechanism, that adds random dummy data to the output. Then we apply this
mechanism to the protection of user attributes in location based services. By
experiments, we demonstrate that the tupling mechanism outperforms popular
local mechanisms in terms of attribute obfuscation and service quality.

topological data analysis (TDA) has been attracting increasingly more
attention. Popular instances of time-evolving data include flocking/swarming
behaviors in animals and social networks in the human sphere. A natural
mathematical model for such collective behaviors is a dynamic point cloud, or
more generally a dynamic metric space (DMS).
  In this paper we extend the Rips filtration stability result for (static)
metric spaces to the setting of DMSs. We do this by devising a certain
three-parameter ""spatiotemporal"" filtration of a DMS. Applying the homology
functor to this filtration gives rise to multidimensional persistence module
derived from the DMS. We show that this multidimensional module enjoys
stability under a suitable generalization of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance
which permits metrizing the collection of all DMSs.
  On the other hand, it is recognized that, in general, comparing two
multidimensional persistence modules leads to intractable computational
problems. For the purpose of practical comparison of DMSs, we focus on both the
rank invariant or the dimension function of the multidimensional persistence
module that is derived from a DMS. We specifically propose to utilize a certain
metric d for comparing these invariants: In our work this d is either (1) a
certain generalization of the erosion distance by Patel, or (2) a specialized
version of the well known interleaving distance. We also study the
computational complexity associated to both choices of d.

results were known. We close this gap by showing that the expected optimisation
time is $\Theta(n^2) \cdot \exp(\Theta(\min\{pn^2, n\}))$ for all $p \le 1/2$,
allowing for the first time to locate the threshold between polynomial and
superpolynomial expected times at $p = \Theta((\log n)/n^2)$. Hence the (1+1)EA
on LeadingOnes is much more sensitive to noise than previously thought. We also
show that offspring populations of size $\lambda \ge 3.42\log n$ can
effectively deal with much higher noise than known before.
  Finally, we present an example of a rugged landscape where prior noise can
help to escape from local optima by blurring the landscape and allowing a hill
climber to see the underlying gradient. We prove that in this particular
setting noise can have a highly beneficial effect on performance.

enables thorough investigation of protein structure formation and evolution.
Although HP model discretizes the conformational space and simplifies the
folding energy function, it has been proven to be an NP-complete problem. In
this paper, we propose a novel protein folding framework FoldingZero,
self-folding a de novo protein 2D HP structure from scratch based on deep
reinforcement learning. FoldingZero features the coupled approach of a two-head
(policy and value heads) deep convolutional neural network (HPNet) and a
regularized Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees (R-UCT). It is trained solely by
a reinforcement learning algorithm, which improves HPNet and R-UCT iteratively
through iterative policy optimization. Without any supervision and domain
knowledge, FoldingZero not only achieves comparable results, but also learns
the latent folding knowledge to stabilize the structure. Without exponential
computation, FoldingZero shows promising potential to be adopted for real-world

presently existing problem is their low room-temperature emission quantum

limited QY by conducting transient photoluminescence (PL) and absorption
measurements across a range of temperatures from 20-300 K. We observe that the
low-temperature PL QY of these samples can be as high as ~25%. However, it
quickly drops with increasing temperature. Interestingly, experimental
observations cannot be explained in terms of a thermally activated nonradiative
rate but rather suggest the existence of two QD sub-ensembles of emissive and
completely nonemissive particles. The temperature-induced variation in the PL
efficiency is likely due to a structural transformation of the QD surfaces or
interior leading to formation of trapping sites or nonemissive phases resulting
in conversion of emissive QDs into nonemissive. Thus, future efforts on
improving emissivity of glass-based perovskite QD samples might focus on
approaches for extending the range of stability of the low-temperature up to

over time, which can necessitate real-time evaluation of their nodal

nodal attributes by estimating a nodal function based on noisy observations at
a subset of nodes. A multikernel-based approach is developed which is scalable
to large-size networks. Unlike most existing methods that re-solve the function
estimation problem over all existing nodes whenever a new node joins the

properties are described by a new set of dynamical tensor variables. In this
work we explore the non-linear dynamics of those modes in a conformal fluid.
Among all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the Divergence Type Theories
(DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of thermodynamics is
satisfied non-perturbatively. In considering a perturbative scheme within this
formalism, at next to leading order a set of Maxwell-Cattaneo equations is
obtained, as in e.g. Israel-Stewart theories. The tensor modes include two
divergence-free modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant
Navier-Stokes equations, and that are particularly relevant because they may
couple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the dynamics of this
irreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories such as DTTs,
thermal fluctuations induce a stochastic stirring force in the equations of
motion, which excites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum
conservation. From fluctuation-dissipation considerations, it follows that the
random force is Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in
turn excite vector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing
a consistent non-linear, second order description of the divergence-free tensor
dynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism we obtain the two-point
correlation function for these tensor modes at next to leading order, and the
induced stochastic component of the energy-momentum tensor. We find that the
thermal fluctuations induce a scale invariant spectrum at short scales, while
preserving a white spectrum at large scales. This result suggests that tensor
modes could sustain an entropy cascade.

through their current updates, up to prospects of their improvements for the
sake of the FCC-ee. It is argued that with an appropriate upgrade of the Monte

effects in the low angle Bhabha process, the total theoretical error of
$0.01\%$ for the FCC-ee luminometry can be reached. A new study of the $Z$ and

measurement updates are transmitted by a source to a destination through an
intermediate relay. Updates are to be sent in a timely fashion that minimizes
the age of information, defined as the time elapsed since the most recent
update at the destination was generated at the source. The source and the relay
communicate using energy harvested from nature, which is stored in
infinite-sized batteries. Both nodes use fixed transmission rates, and hence
updates incur fixed delays (service times). Two problems are formulated: an
offline problem, in which the energy arrival information is known a priori, and
an online problem, in which such information is revealed causally over time. In
both problems, it is shown that it is optimal to transmit updates from the
source just in time as the relay is ready to forward them to the destination,
making the source and the relay act as one combined node. A recurring theme in
the optimal policy is that updates should be as uniformly spread out over time
as possible, subject to energy causality and service time constraints. This is
perfectly achieved in the offline setting, and is achieved almost surely in the
online setting by a best effort policy.

intriguing aspects of pulsar radio emission. This phenomenon is generally
explained by the presence of a carousel of sparks in the polar acceleration gap
region that rotates around the magnetic axis due to the E$\times$B drift. While
there have been extensive single pulse studies, geometric signatures of the
underlying carousel, or lack thereof, in simultaneous multi-frequency
observations have remained largely unexplored. This work presents a theoretical
account of such expected signatures, particularly that of a geometry induced
phase-offset in subpulse modulation, including various formulae that can be
readily applied to observations. A notable result is a method to resolve
aliasing in the measured subpulse modulation period without relying on
knowledge of the viewing geometry parameters. It is also shown in detail that
the geometry induced phase-offset enables critical tests of various observed
phenomena as well as proposed hypotheses, e.g., multi-altitude emission,
magnetic field twisting, pseudo-nulls, etc., in addition to that of the
carousel model itself. Finally, a detailed analysis of a 327 MHz pulse-sequence
of PSR B1237+25 is presented as a case study to test the single-frequency
multi-altitude emission scenario. The analysis provides a firm evidence of
inner and outer conal components of this pulsar to have originated from the

LISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties
of MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this
aim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within
their host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the
binaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is
driven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel
channel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black
hole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with
physically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the
orbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between $\approx 25$ and
$\approx 75$ events per year depending on the seed model. We show that
triple-induced coalescences can range from a few detected events up to $\sim
30\%$ of the total detected mergers. Moreover, even if the standard
gas/stars-driven evolutionary channels should fail and MBHBs were to stall,
triple interactions would still occur as a result of the hierarchical nature of
galaxy formation, resulting in about $\approx 10$ to $\approx 20$ LISA
detections per year. Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can
produce coalescing binaries with large eccentricities ($\gtrsim 0.9$) upon
entrance into the LISA band. This eccentricity will remain significant ($\sim
0.1$) also at merger, requiring suitable templates for parameter estimation.

arguments are largely spurious, because of the absence of states carrying
spin-2 Stuckelberg $U(1)$ charge, and because of incorrect scaling assumptions.
Known examples such as Kaluza-Klein theory that respect the usual WGC do so
because of the existence of a genuine $U(1)$ field under which states are
charged, as in the case of the Stuckelberg formulation of spin-1 theories, for
which there is an unambiguously defined $U(1)$ charge. Theories of bigravity
naturally satisfy a naive formulation of the WGC, $M_W< M_{\rm Pl}$, since the
force of the massless graviton is always weaker than the massive spin-2 modes.
It also follows that theories of massive gravity trivially satisfies this form
of the WGC. We also point out that the identification of a massive spin-2 state
in a truncated higher derivative theory, such as Einstein-Weyl-squared or its
supergravity extension, bears no relationship with massive spin-2 states in the
UV completion, contrary to previous statements in the literature. We also
discuss the conjecture from a swampland perspective and show how the emergence
of a universal upper bound on the cutoff relies on strong assumptions on the
scale of the couplings between the spin-2 and other fields, an assumption which
is known to be violated in explicit examples.

dynamical behavior which drastically changes across the transition. In
particular, the asymptotic value of the QFI, as well as its characteristic
timescales, witness the transition both through their dependence on the
interaction strength and through the scaling with the system size. Since the
QFI also sets the ultimate bound for the precision of parameter estimation, it
provides a metrological perspective on the characterization of entanglement
dynamics in many-body systems. Here we show that quantum ergodic dynamics
allows for a much faster production of metrologically useful states.

reionization strongly depends on the quasar SED and occurs earlier for UVB

sample of nearly 400 quiescent galaxies in the core of Virgo with stellar
masses $10^{5}\lesssim M_{*}/M_{\odot} \lesssim10^{12}$. The nucleation
fraction reaches a peak value $f_{n}\approx90\%$ for $M_{*} \approx 10^{9}
M_{\odot}$ galaxies and declines for both higher and lower masses, but nuclei
populate galaxies as small as $M_{*} \approx5\times10^{5} M_{\odot}$.
Comparison with literature data for nearby groups and clusters shows that at
the low-mass end nucleation is more frequent in denser environments. The NSC
mass function peaks at $M_{NSC}\approx7\times10^{5} M_{\odot}$, a factor 3-4
times larger than the turnover mass for globular clusters (GCs). We find a
nonlinear relation between the stellar masses of NSCs and of their host
galaxies, with a mean nucleus-to-galaxy mass ratio that drops to
$M_{NSC}/M_{*}\approx3.6\times10^{-3}$ for $M_{*} \approx 5\times10^{9}

more prominent: $M_{NSC}\propto M_{*}^{0.46}$ at the low-mass end, where nuclei
are nearly 50% as massive as their hosts. We measure an intrinsic scatter in
NSC masses at fixed galaxy stellar mass of 0.4 dex, which we interpret as
evidence that the process of NSC growth is significantly stochastic. At low
galaxy masses we find a close connection between NSCs and GC systems, including
a very similar occupation distribution and comparable total masses. We discuss
these results in the context of current dissipative and dissipationless models

environment in which the elementary excitations arise, has been explored for
very strong coupling only. We report high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and
ab-initio phonon calculations of {\ceaual}, an archetypal fluctuating valence
compound. The high resolution of our data allows us to quantify the energy
scales of three coupling mechanisms between phonons, CEF-split localized 4f
electron states, and conduction electrons. Although these interactions do not
appear to be atypically strong for this class of materials, we resolve, for the
first time, a profound renormalization of low-energy quasiparticle excitations
on all levels. The key anomalies of the spectrum we observe comprise (1) the
formation of a CEF-phonon bound state with a comparatively low density of
acoustic phonons reminiscent of vibronic modes observed in other materials,
where they require a pronounced abundance of optical phonons, (2) an
anti-crossing of CEF states and acoustic phonons, and (3) a strong broadening
of CEF states due to the hybridization with more itinerant excitations. The
fact that all of these features are well resolved in CeAuAl$_3$ suggests that
similar hybrid excitations should also be dominant in a large family of related
materials. This promises a predictive understanding towards the discovery of
new magneto-elastic functionalities and instabilities.

stars of Tucana III, a Milky Way satellite galaxy candidate in the process of
being tidally disrupted as it is accreted by the Galaxy. Two of these stars are
centrally located in the core of the galaxy while the other two stars are
located in the eastern and western tidal tails. The four stars have chemical
abundance patterns consistent with the one previously studied star in Tucana
III: they are moderately enhanced in $r$-process elements, i.e. they have
$<$[Eu/Fe]$> \approx +$0.4 dex. The non-neutron-capture elements generally
follow trends seen in other dwarf galaxies, including a metallicity range of
0.44 dex and the expected trend in $\alpha$-elements, i.e., the lower
metallicity stars have higher Ca and Ti abundance. Overall, the chemical
abundance patterns of these stars suggest that Tucana III was an ultra-faint
dwarf galaxy, and not a globular cluster, before being tidally disturbed. As is
the case for the one other galaxy dominated by $r$-process enhanced stars,
Reticulum II, Tucana III's stellar chemical abundances are consistent with
pollution from ejecta produced by a binary neutron star merger, although a
different $r$-process element or dilution gas mass is required to explain the
abundances in these two galaxies if a neutron star merger is the sole source of
$r$-process enhancement.

a large quantum Fisher information (QFI). We find methods, which only involve
experimental elements that are available with current or near-future
technology, for engineering quantum states with up to a 100-fold improvement

Gaussian state. Such states are a superposition of the vacuum with a large

Schr\""odinger-cat-like states. We then apply the two most dominant noise
sources in our setting -- photon loss and imperfect heralding -- and use the
algorithm to find quantum states that still improve over the optimal Gaussian
state with realistic levels of noise. This will open up experimental and
technological work in using exotic non-Gaussian states for quantum-enhanced

fears: we are weird. If our Solar System were observed with present-day Earth
technology -- to put our system and exoplanets on the same footing -- Jupiter
is the only planet that would be detectable. The statistics of exo-Jupiters
indicate that the Solar System is unusual at the ~1% level among Sun-like stars
(or ~0.1% among all stars). But why are we different?
  Successful formation models for both the Solar System and exoplanet systems
rely on two key processes: orbital migration and dynamical instability. Systems
of close-in super-Earths or sub-Neptunes require substantial radial inward
motion of solids either as drifting mm- to cm-sized pebbles or migrating
Earth-mass or larger planetary embryos. We argue that, regardless of their
formation mode, the late evolution of super-Earth systems involves migration
into chains of mean motion resonances, generally followed by instability when
the disk dissipates. This pattern is likely also ubiquitous in giant planet
systems. We present three models for inner Solar System formation -- the
low-mass asteroid belt, Grand Tack, and Early Instability models -- each
invoking a combination of migration and instability.
  We identify bifurcation points in planetary system formation. We present a
series of events to explain why our Solar System is so weird. Jupiter's core
must have formed fast enough to quench the growth of Earth's building blocks by
blocking the flux of inward-drifting pebbles. The large Jupiter/Saturn mass
ratio is rare among giant exoplanets but may be required to maintain Jupiter's
wide orbit. The giant planets' instability must have been gentle, with no close
encounters between Jupiter and Saturn, also unusual in the larger (exoplanet)
context. Our Solar System system is thus the outcome of multiple unusual, but
not unheard of, events.

We have developed a parametric fitting procedure that uses native imaging and
visibility data, and tested it using the rich data sets from ALMA, Bolocam, and
Planck available for this object. RX J1347.5-1145 is a very hot and luminous
cluster showing signatures of a merger. Previous X-ray-motivated SZ studies
have highlighted the presence of an excess SZ signal south-east of the X-ray
peak, which was generally interpreted as a strong, shock-induced pressure
perturbation. Our model, when centred at the X-ray peak, confirms this.
However, the presence of two almost equally bright giant elliptical galaxies
separated by $\sim100\;{\rm kpc}$ makes the choice of the cluster centre
ambiguous, and allows for considerable freedom in modelling the structure of
the galaxy cluster. For instance, we have shown that the SZ signal can be
well-described by a single smooth ellipsoidal generalized Navarro-Frenk-White
profile, where the best-fitting centroid is located between the two brightest
cluster galaxies. This leads to a considerably weaker excess SZ signal from the
south-eastern substructure. Further, the most prominent features seen in the
X-ray can be explained as predominantly isobaric structures, alleviating the
need for highly supersonic velocities, although overpressurized regions
associated with the moving subhaloes are still present in our model.

estimate a mass of $\sim 2000$ M$_\odot$ for the main structure. Therefore, the
network harbours a large reservoir of gas and dust that could still be accreted

reveal velocity oscillations in C$^{18}$O along the spine in the main filament

$\mu(n)$ is the M\""obius function) with the Mertens sum $\mu(1) + \mu(2)

integral kernels that are step-function approximations to $K$. We obtain new
results concerning the distribution of the relevant reciprocal eigenvalues:
those of the approximations to $K$, and those of $K$ itself. The proofs utilise
both the Hilbert-Schmidt theory of linear integral equations and Weyl's
inequalities for reciprocal eigenvalues of kernels $U,V,W$ satisfying $U=V+W$.
We show also that $S(N)$ is reasonably well approximated by sums involving just
$\mu(1),\ldots,\mu(N)$, a limited number of reciprocal eigenvalues of $K$ and
the values that the corresponding eigenfunctions have at the points $x={1\over

quantum-classical variational algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial
optimization problems. Despite its promise for near-term quantum applications,
not much is currently understood about QAOA's performance beyond its
lowest-depth variant. An essential but missing ingredient for understanding and
deploying QAOA is a constructive approach to carry out the outer-loop classical
optimization. We provide an in-depth study of the performance of QAOA on MaxCut
problems by developing an efficient parameter-optimization procedure and
revealing its ability to exploit non-adiabatic operations. Building on observed
patterns in optimal parameters, we propose heuristic strategies for
initializing optimizations to find quasi-optimal $p$-level QAOA parameters in
$O(\text{poly}(p))$ time, whereas the standard strategy of random
initialization requires $2^{O(p)}$ optimization runs to achieve similar
performance. We then benchmark QAOA and compare it with quantum annealing,
especially on difficult instances where adiabatic quantum annealing fails due
to small spectral gaps. The comparison reveals that QAOA can learn via
optimization to utilize non-adiabatic mechanisms to circumvent the challenges
associated with vanishing spectral gaps. Finally, we provide a realistic
resource analysis on the experimental implementation of QAOA. When quantum
fluctuations in measurements are accounted for, we illustrate that optimization
will be important only for problem sizes beyond numerical simulations, but
accessible on near-term devices. We propose a feasible implementation of large
MaxCut problems with a few hundred vertices in a system of 2D neutral atoms,

dynamics, we define a criterion to see if waves can become nonlinear and if so,

angular momentum transport and mixing within stellar interiors. We find that
the IGW generation spectrum, convective velocities and the strength of density

the Tur\'an number of $M_{k+1}$ (a matching of size $k+1$) as follows: \[

  A linear forest is a graph whose connected components are all paths or

special cases.

peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core from
multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous
appearance and shape, segmentation of the sub-regions is very challenging.
Recent development using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in
the past several brain segmentation challenges as well as other semantic and
medical image segmentation problems. Most models in brain tumor segmentation
use a 2D/3D patch to predict the class label for the center voxel and variant
patch sizes and scales are used to improve the model performance. However, it
has low computation efficiency and also has limited receptive field. U-Net is a
widely used network structure for end-to-end segmentation and can be used on
the entire image or extracted patches to provide classification labels over the
entire input voxels so that it is more efficient and expect to yield better
performance with larger input size. Furthermore, instead of picking the best
network structure, an ensemble of multiple models, trained on different dataset
or different hyper-parameters, can generally improve the segmentation
performance. In this study we propose to use an ensemble of 3D U-Nets with
different hyper-parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Preliminary results
showed effectiveness of this model. In addition, we developed a linear model
for survival prediction using extracted imaging and non-imaging features,
which, despite the simplicity, can effectively reduce overfitting and
regression errors.

covers the virial radius. The main goal of the present work is to provide the
analysis of the light distribution for all galaxies out to unprecedented limits
(in radius and surface brightness) and to release the main products resulting
from this analysis in all FDS bands. From the isophote fit, we derive the
azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles, the position angle and
ellipticity profiles as a function of the semi-major axis. In each band, we
derive the total magnitudes, effective radii, integrated colors and stellar
mass-to-light ratios. The long integration times, the arcsec-level angular
resolution of OmegaCam@VST and the large covered area of FDS allow us to map
the light and color distributions out to large galactocentric distances (up to
about 10-15 R_e) and surface brightness levels beyond mu_r = 27 mag/arcsec^2
(mu_B > 28 mag/arcsec^2). Therefore, the new FDS data allow us to explore in
great detail the morphology and structure of cluster galaxies out to the region
of the stellar halo. The observations suggest that the Fornax cluster is not
completely relaxed inside the virial radius. The bulk of the gravitational
interactions between galaxies happens in the W-NW core region of the cluster,
where most of the bright early-type galaxies are located and where the
intra-cluster baryons (diffuse light and GCs) are found. We suggest that the
W-NW sub-clump of galaxies results from an infalling group onto the cluster,
which has modified the structure of the galaxy outskirts (making asymmetric
stellar halos) and has produced the intra-cluster baryons (ICL and GCs),
concentrated in this region of the cluster.

containing localized coherent structures of different spatial scales. Here,
wavelets are used to study the onset and subsequent transition to fully
developed turbulence from a laminar state. Originally applied to neutral fluid
turbulence, an iterative wavelet technique decomposes the field into coherent
and incoherent contributions. In contrast to Fourier power spectra, finite time
Lyapunov exponents (FTLE), and simple measures of intermittency such as
non-Gaussian statistics of field increments, the wavelet technique is found to
provide a quantitative measure for the onset of turbulence and to track the
transition to fully developed turbulence. The wavelet method makes no
assumptions about the structure of the coherent current sheets or the
underlying plasma model. Temporal evolution of the coherent and incoherent
wavelet fluctuations is found to be highly correlated with the magnetic field
energy and plasma thermal energy, respectively. The onset of turbulence is
identified with the rapid growth of a background of incoherent fluctuations
spreading across a range of scales and a corresponding drop in the coherent
components. This is suggestive of the interpretation of the coherent and
incoherent wavelet fluctuations as measures of coherent structures (e.g.,
current sheets) and dissipation, respectively. The ratio of the incoherent to
coherent fluctuations $R_{ic}$ is found to be fairly uniform across different
plasma models and provides an empirical threshold for turbulence onset. The
technique is illustrated through examples. First, it is applied to the
Kelvin--Helmholtz instability from different simulation models including fully
kinetic, hybrid (kinetic ion/fluid electron), and Hall MHD simulations. Second,
it is applied to the development of turbulence downstream of the bowshock in a
magnetosphere simulation.

Herein, we adopt a mixed quantum-classical description of a device, in which

surrounding heat baths are treated in a classical-like fashion. By introducing
such a mixed quantum-classical description of the composite system, one is able
to study the heat transfer between the subsystem and bath from a closed system
point of view, thereby avoiding simplifying assumptions related to the bath
time scale and subsystem-bath coupling strength. In particular, we adopt the
full counting statistics approach to derive a general expression for the moment
generating function of heat in systems whose dynamics are described by the
quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE). From this expression, one can
deduce expressions for the dynamics of the average heat and heat current, which
may be evaluated using numerical simulations. Due to the approximate nature of
the QCLE, we also find that the steady state fluctuation symmetry holds up to
order $\hbar$ for systems whose subsystembath couplings and baths go beyond

Hopfield networks have mostly been used as a noise tolerant memory or to solve

noise tolerant associative memory is their low capacity of storage, scaling
only linearly with the number of nodes in the network. A larger capacity
therefore requires a larger number of nodes, thereby reducing the speed of
convergence of the network in addition to increasing hardware costs for
acquiring more precise data to be fed to a larger number of nodes. Our paper
proposes a new algorithm to allow the use of several Hopfield networks in
parallel thereby increasing the cumulative storage capacity of the system many
times as compared to a single Hopfield network. Our algorithm would also be
much faster than a larger single Hopfield network with the same total capacity.
This enables their use in applications like denoising QR codes, which we have
demonstrated in our paper. We then test our network on a large set of QR code
images with different types of noise and demonstrate that such a system of
Hopfield networks can be used to denoise and recognize QR codes in real time.

both tasks, regardless of scanning geometries in terms of projections or

result, sinogram-space algorithms could be used in field settings for binary

facilitate growth past barriers in the metre size range. Amongst a number of
mechanisms that can amplify the local density of solids, aerodynamic streaming
instability (SI) is one of the most promising. This work tests the physical
assumptions of models that lead to SI in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We
conduct laboratory experiments in which we track the three-dimensional motion
of spherical solid particles fluidized in a low-pressure, laminar,
incompressible, gas stream. The particle sizes span the Stokes-Epstein drag
regime transition and the overall dust-to-gas mass density ratio is close to
unity. Lambrechts et al. (2016) established the similarity of the laboratory
flow to a simplified PPD model flow. We obtain experimental results suggesting
an instability due to particle-gas interaction: i) there exist variations in
particle concentration in the direction of the mean drag forces; ii) the
particles have a tendency to 'catch up' to one another when they are in
proximity; iii) particle clumping occurs on very small scales, which implies
local enhancements above the background dust-to-gas mass density ratio by
factors of several tens; v) the presence of these density enhancements occurs
for a mean dust-to-gas mass density ratio approaching or greater than 1; v) we
find evidence for collective particle drag reduction when the local particle
number density becomes high and when the background gas pressure is high so
that the drag is in the continuum regime. The experiments presented here are
precedent-setting for observing SI under controlled conditions and may lead to
a deeper understanding of how it operates in nature.

contact lengths on sensitivity and sensor offset was evaluated. Calculations
that take into account the shape of the device show that devices with
point-like contacts have the highest current-scaled sensitivity (68.9 V/A/T),
while devices with contacts of equal length to their non-contact sides have the
highest voltage-scaled sensitivity (86.9 mV/V/T). The sensitivities of the two
other devices follow the predicted trends closely. All the devices have offsets
less than 20 $\mu$T at low supply current operation (< 300 $\mu$A) and most
remain below 35 $\mu$T at higher supply current (up to 1.2 mA). The consistent
low offsets across the devices imply that the choice of Hall-effect sensor
geometry should mainly depend on whether the device is current-biased or
voltage-biased and the frequency at which it will operate. This work
demonstrates that GaN Hall-effect sensor performance can be improved by
adjusting the geometry of the Hall-effect plate specific to its function (e.g.,

scientific phenomena. Thus, an ability to codify geometric features into a
mathematical quantity can be critical. Recently, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have demonstrated the promising capability of extracting and codifying
features from visual information. However, the progress has been concentrated
in computer vision applications where there exists an inherent grid-like
structure. In contrast, many geometry processing problems are defined on curved
surfaces, and the generalization of CNNs is not quite trivial. The difficulties
are rooted in the lack of key ingredients such as the canonical grid-like
representation, the notion of consistent orientation, and a compatible local
topology across the domain. In this paper, we prove that the convolution of two
functions can be represented as a simple dot product between Zernike polynomial
coefficients; and the rotation of a convolution kernel is essentially a set of
2-by-2 rotation matrices applied to the coefficients. As such, the key
contribution of this work resides in a concise but rigorous mathematical

  The hypothesized phase transition is not directly accessible in a bulk

models of biological networks using statistical model checking (SMC). A key
aspect of our work is the modeling of single-cell variability by assigning a
probability distribution to intervals of initial concentration values and
kinetic rate constants. We propagate this distribution through the system
dynamics to obtain a distribution over the set of trajectories of the ODEs.
This in turn opens the door for performing statistical analysis of the ODE
system's behavior. To illustrate this we first encode quantitative data and
qualitative trends as bounded linear time temporal logic (BLTL) formulas. Based
on this we construct a parameter estimation method using an SMC-driven
evaluation procedure applied to the stochastic version of the behavior of the
ODE system. We then describe how this SMC framework can be generalized to
hybrid automata by exploiting the given distribution over the initial states
and the--much more sophisticated--system dynamics to associate a Markov chain
with the hybrid automaton. We then establish a strong relationship between the
behaviors of the hybrid automaton and its associated Markov chain.
Consequently, we sample trajectories from the hybrid automaton in a way that
mimics the sampling of the trajectories of the Markov chain. This enables us to
verify approximately that the Markov chain meets a BLTL specification with high
probability. We have applied these methods to ODE based models of Toll-like
receptor signaling and the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, as well
as to systems exhibiting hybrid dynamics including the circadian clock pathway
and cardiac cell physiology. We present an overview of these applications and
summarize the main empirical results. These case studies demonstrate that the
our methods can be applied in a variety of practical settings.

  We provide applications in both dependent and independent random variables.
This includes deviation inequalities for empirical processes $f(X) = \sup_{g

using a special Lyapunov function, we show that NASA achieves the sample
complexity of ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon^{2})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate
stationary point, thus outperforming all extant methods for nested stochastic
approximation. Our method and its analysis are the same for both unconstrained
and constrained problems, without any need of batch samples for constrained
nonconvex stochastic optimization. We also present a simplified variant of the
NASA method for solving constrained single level stochastic optimization
problems, and we prove the same complexity result for both unconstrained and

Gaussian (G) velocity distribution and 38 clusters have a complex or

into 'active' and 'passive' galaxies, according to their sSFRs and stellar
masses. Our results indicate a strong spatial segregation between active and
passive galaxies both in G and NG systems, with passive galaxies being more
central. We also found that the passive population in G systems is the only
family with lower velocity dispersions for the brightest galaxies ($M_r
\lesssim -22.75$), thus presenting velocity segregation with luminosity. The
similarity found between the VDPs of the galaxy populations in NG systems
indicate that these sets probably share a similar mix of orbits. We also found
a clear evolutionary trend for G systems, with brighter galaxies in richer
clusters having flatter VDPs. The scenario emerging from this study suggests a
direct relationship between segregation effects, VDPs and the dynamic state of
clusters.

Recent progress on the definition of the multipole moments of a compact object

in modified theories of gravity. Specifically, the aim of this work is to study
them for scalarized stars in scalar-tensor theories with a massless scalar
field that admit spontaneous scalarization. We find that the 3-hair relations
between the mass and angular momentum moments that hold in general relativity
hold for scalarized stars as well. The scalar moments also exhibit a universal
behaviour, which is equation of state independent within one specific theory,
but differs between different theories. Combining astrophysical observations
one can in principle measure the different properties of scalarized neutron
star and tell different theories apart.

through the emission of gravitational waves, as recently illustrated by LIGO.
The spin of the BBHs is one of the parameters that LIGO can infer from the
gravitational wave signal and can be used to constrain their production site.
If BBHs are assembled in stellar clusters they are likely to interact with
stars, which could occasionally lead to a tidal disruption event (TDE). When a
BBH tidally disrupts a star it can accrete a significant fraction of the
debris, effectively altering the spins of the BHs. Therefore, although
dynamically formed BBHs are expected to have random spin orientations, tidal
stellar interactions can significantly alter their birth spins both in
direction and magnitude. Here we investigate how TDEs by BBHs can affect the
properties of the BH members as well as exploring the characteristics of the
resulting electromagnetic signatures. We conduct hydrodynamic simulations with
a Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code of a wide range of
representative tidal interactions. We find that both spin magnitude and
orientation can be altered and temporarily aligned or anti-aligned through
accretion of stellar debris, with a significant dependence on the mass ratio of
the disrupted star and the BBH members. These tidal interactions feed material
to the BBH at very high accretion rates, with the potential to launch a
relativistic jet. The corresponding beamed emission is a beacon to an otherwise
quiescent BBH.

requires tremendous amount of self-interference (SI) cancellation. Recent
advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in
integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where RF
filters channelize the SI signal path. Unlike other FD implementations, that
mostly rely on delay lines, FDE-based cancellers can be realized in
small-form-factor devices. However, the fundamental limits and higher layer
challenges associated with these cancellers were not explored yet. Therefore,
and in order to support the integration with a software-defined radio (SDR) and
to facilitate experimentation in a testbed with several nodes, we design and
implement an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We derive
and experimentally validate the PCB canceller model and present a canceller
configuration scheme based on an optimization problem. We then extensively
evaluate the performance of the FDE-based FD radio in the SDR testbed.
Experiments show that it achieves 95dB overall SIC (52dB from RF SIC) across
20MHz bandwidth, and an average link-level FD gain of 1.87x. We also conduct
experiments in: (i) uplink-downlink networks with inter-user interference, and

trajectories for automated vehicles in complex environments. However, a fast
convergence to the optimal solution can only be ensured with the use of
problem-specific sampling distributions. Due to the large variety of driving
situations within the context of automated driving, it is very challenging to
manually design such distributions. This paper introduces therefore a
data-driven approach utilizing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN): Given
the current driving situation, future ego-vehicle poses can be directly
generated from the output of the CNN allowing to guide the motion planner
efficiently towards the optimal solution. A benchmark highlights that the CNN
predicts future vehicle poses with a higher accuracy compared to uniform
sampling and a state-of-the-art A*-based approach. Combining this CNN-guided
sampling with the motion planner Bidirectional RRT* reduces the computation
time by up to an order of magnitude and yields a faster convergence to a lower
cost as well as a success rate of 100 % in the tested scenarios.

drives the structure to an amorphous state, an analysis of the polyhedral

monoclinic phase can promote such molecule formation, while such octahedral
rotation is not possible in the cubic phase. However, once the symmetry of the
cubic structure is broken by substituting Ti for Zr, it becomes less resistant
to amorphization. A compound made of 50% Ti and 50% Zr (La$_2$TiZrO$_7$) is
found to be more resistant in the monoclinic than in the cubic phase, which may
be related to the lower bandgap of the cubic phase. These results illustrate
the complex interplay of structure and composition that give rise to the

operate in two phases: an exploration phase and a verification phase. In the
exploration phase, selection of experiments is such that a moderate level of
confidence on the true hypothesis is achieved. Subsequent experiment design
aims at improving the confidence level on this hypothesis to the desired level.
In this paper, the focus is on the verification phase. A confidence measure is
defined and active hypothesis testing is formulated as a confidence
maximization problem in an infinite-horizon average-reward Partially Observable
Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting. The problem of maximizing confidence
conditioned on a particular hypothesis is referred to as the hypothesis
verification problem. The relationship between hypothesis testing and
verification problems is established. The verification problem can be
formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Optimal solutions for the
verification MDP are characterized and a simple heuristic adaptive strategy for
verification is proposed based on a zero-sum game interpretation of

Standard Model (SM) containing extra Higgs doublet fields. Given the
multiplicity of Higgs states in a 2HDM, its Higgs potential is significantly
more involved than the SM one. Importantly, it contains a multitude of Higgs
triple self-couplings, unlike the SM, which only has one. These interactions
are key to understanding the phenomenology of the 2HDM, as they uniquely
determine the form of the potential. Several studies analysing the prospects of
measuring these couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have found them to
be quite low generally. However, such studies have largely concentrated on
Higgs pair-production induced by gluon-gluon scattering, either via direct
annihilation or followed by their splitting into $b$-(anti)quark pairs, which
in turn annihilate leaving behind spectator $b$-(anti)quarks. Both of these
channels are therefore governed by QCD dynamics. We compare here the yields of
such channels to those initiated by (primarily) valence quarks, which involve
Electro-Weak (EW) interactions only, for neutral multi-Higgs final states. We
find that EW production can be dominant over QCD production for certain final
state combinations. We also illustrate that charged final states, which can
only be produced via EW modes, could serve as important probes of some $H^\pm$
triple couplings, that are inaccessible in QCD-induced processes, during Run 2
and 3 of the LHC. Our analysis covers regions of the parameter space of the
Type-I 2HDM that have escaped the most up-to-date experimental constraints
coming from EW precision data, LHC measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs boson
properties, searches for additional Higgs states, and flavour physics.

alternative to classical cryptography for secure communication. However, its
transmission distance is restricted to metropolitan areas, given that it is
affected by the channel excess noise and losses. In this paper, we present a
scheme for implementing long-distance CVQKD using separable Gaussian states.
This tunable QKD protocol requires separable Gaussian states, which are
squeezed and displaced, along with the assistance of classical communication
and available linear optics compoments. This protocol originates from the
entanglement of one mode and the auxiliary mode used for distribution, which is
first destroyed by local correlated noises and restored subsequently by the
interference of the auxillary mode with the second distant separable correlated
mode. The displacement matrix is organized by two six-dimensional vectors and
is finally fixed by the separability of the tripartite system. The separability
between the ancilla and Alice and Bob's system mitigates the enemy's
eavesdropping, leading to tolerating higher excess noise and achieving longer
transmission distance.

a discovery. In contrast, recent results ($p_t$-spectrum and
angular-correlation features) from $p$-Pb collisions at the large hadron

such claims via a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of identified-hadron

from a previous study of ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ data from the same system.
$p$-Pb $p_t$ spectra for pions, kaons, protons and Lambdas are described by the
TCM within their point-to-point uncertainties. Invariance of the TCM hard
component vs $p$-Pb centrality indicates that jet formation remains unchanged
in $p$-Pb collisions relative to $p$-$p$ collisions, and radial-flow
contributions to spectra are negligible. These $p$-Pb TCM results have
implications for interpretation of similar data features from A-A collisions in

broad range of experimental situations, including mapping the elastic stress

addition, we observe surprisingly large stress contributions from functional
electronic devices fabricated on the diamond, and also demonstrate sensitivity
to deformations of materials in contact with the diamond. Our technique could

soft-particles, wherein particles interact only if they occupy the same or a
neighboring site, as a simple representation of penetrable particles of soft
condensed matter. To represent different scenarios, two different realizations
of the lattice model are considered, a one-component and a two-component
system, where in the two-component case particles of the same species repel and
those of opposite species attract each other. The systems are analyzed entirely
within the transfer matrix framework. Special attention is paid to the
criterion devised in Ref. [Phys. Rev. E 63, 031206 (2001)], which serves to
separate two classes of behavior encountered in a one-component penetrable
particle systems. In addition to confirm the existence of a similar criterion
for the one-component lattice-gas model, we find that the same criterion can be
applied to the two-component system to provide conditions for thermodynamic
catastrophe.

Namely, two conics are compatible (can be connected by rule segments in a

compatible with only themselves (when scaled from a focus), and ellipses

has not been easy to describe within the self-consistent mean-field

prolate deformation is predicted in $58\leq N\leq 72$, while the shape switches
to oblate at $N=74$. The sphericity returns at $N=80$ and $82$. The deformation
in $60\lesssim N\lesssim 70$ resolves the discrepancy in the previous

tensor-force effects significantly depend on the configurations, and are
pointed out to be conspicuous when the unique-parity orbit (e.g. $n0h_{11/2}$)

accurately reproduce holographic states in conformal field theories (CFTs).
Given a state in a large-$N$ CFT with a static, semiclassical gravitational
dual, we build a tensor network by an iterative series of approximations that
eliminate redundant degrees of freedom and minimize the bond dimensions of the
resulting network. We argue that the bond dimensions of the tensor network will
match the areas of the corresponding bulk surfaces. For 'tree' tensor networks
(i.e., those that are constructed by discretizing spacetime with
non-intersecting Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces), our arguments can be made rigorous
using a version of one-shot entanglement distillation in the CFT. Using the
known quantum error correcting properties of AdS/CFT, we show that bulk legs
can be added to the tensor networks to create holographic quantum error
correcting codes. These codes behave similarly to previous holographic tensor
network toy models, but describe actual bulk excitations in continuum AdS/CFT.
  By assuming some natural generalizations of the 'holographic entanglement of
purification' conjecture, we are able to construct tensor networks for more
general bulk discretizations, leading to finer-grained networks that partition
the information content of a Ryu-Takayanagi surface into tensor-factorized
subregions. While the granularity of such a tensor network must be set larger
than the string/Planck scales, we expect that it can be chosen to lie well
below the AdS scale. However, we also prove a no-go theorem which shows that
the bulk-to-boundary maps cannot all be isometries in a tensor network with
intersecting Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces.

the second phase, the relay forwards the symbol decoded by successive
interference cancellation to the destination, whereas the source transmits a
new symbol to the destination in parallel with the relay, following the
principle of uplink NOMA. The ergodic sum capacity, outage probability, and
outage sum capacity are investigated comprehensively along with analytical
derivations, under both perfect and imperfect successive interference

or hard-to-reach populations. It collects samples from a networked population
by incentivizing participants to refer their friends into the study. One major
challenge in analyzing RDS samples is seed bias. Seed bias refers to the fact
that when the social network is divided into multiple communities (or blocks),
the RDS sample might not provide a balanced representation of the different
communities in the population, and such unbalance is correlated with the
initial participant (or the seed). In this case, the distributions of
estimators are typically non-trivial mixtures, which are determined (1) by the
seed and (2) by how the referrals transition from one block to another. This
paper shows that (1) block-transition probabilities are easy to estimate with
high accuracy, and (2) we can use these estimated block-transition
probabilities to estimate the stationary distribution over blocks and thus, an
estimate of the block proportions. This stationary distribution on blocks has
previously been used in the RDS literature to evaluate whether the sampling
process has appeared to `mix'. We use these estimated block proportions in a
simple post-stratified (PS) estimator that greatly diminishes seed bias. By
aggregating over the blocks/strata in this way, we prove that the PS estimator
is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent under a Markov model, even when other estimators are
not. Simulations show that the PS estimator has smaller Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE) compared to the state-of-the-art estimators.

reconnection outflows collide with closed dense flaring loops, are believed to
be one of the possible candidates for plasma heating and particle acceleration.
In this work, we perform resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations in a classic
Kopp-Pneuman flare configuration to study the formation and evolution of TSs,
and analyze in detail the dynamic features of TSs and variations of the shock
strength in space and time. This research focuses on the fast reconnection
phase when plasmoids form and produce small-scale structures inside the flare
current sheet. It is found that the TS emerges once the downward outflow
colliding with closed magnetic loops becomes super-magnetosonic, and
immediately becomes highly dynamical. The morphology of a TS can be flat,
oblique, or curved depending on the detailed interactions between the
outflows/plasmoids and the highly dynamic plasma in the looptop region. The TS
becomes weaker when a plasmoid is crossing through, or may even be destroyed by
well developed plasmoids and then re-constructed above the plasmoids. We also
perform detailed statistical analysis on important physical quantities along
and across the shock front. The density and temperature ratios range from 1 to
3 across the TS front, and the pressure ratio typically has larger values up to
10. We show that weak guide fields do not strongly affect the Mach number and
compression ratios, and the TS length becomes slightly larger in the case with
thermal conduction.

Under the deep matching framework, vector-based ad retrieval harnesses user
recent behavior sequence to retrieve relevant ad candidates without the
constraint of keyword bidding. Simultaneously, the deep model is employed to
perform the global pre-ranking of ad candidates from multiple retrieval paths
effectively and efficiently. Besides, the proposed model tries to optimize the
pointwise cross-entropy loss which is consistent with the objective of predict

of the most effective techniques for finding security bugs in practice.
Particularly, American Fuzzy Lop (AFL for short) is deemed to be a great
success in fuzzing relatively simple test inputs. Unfortunately, when it meets
structured test inputs such as XML and JavaScript, those grammar-blind trimming

  To this end, we propose a grammar-aware coverage-based greybox fuzzing
approach to fuzz programs that process structured inputs. Given the grammar
(which is often publicly available) of test inputs, we introduce a
grammar-aware trimming strategy to trim test inputs at the tree level using the
abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of parsed test inputs. Further, we introduce two
grammar-aware mutation strategies (i.e., enhanced dictionary-based mutation and
tree-based mutation). Specifically, tree-based mutation works via replacing
subtrees using the ASTs of parsed test inputs. Equipped with grammar-awareness,
our approach can carry the fuzzing exploration into width and depth.
  We implemented our approach as an extension to AFL, named Superion; and
evaluated the effectiveness of Superion on real-life large-scale programs (a
XML engine libplist and three JavaScript engines WebKit, Jerryscript and

the BIP for wireless VR users, a novel model that jointly considers the VR
application type, transmission delay, VR video quality, and users' awareness of
the virtual environment is proposed. In the developed model, the base stations
(BSs) transmit VR videos to the wireless VR users using directional
transmission links so as to provide high data rates for the VR users, thus,
reducing the number of BIP for each user. Since the body movements of a VR user
may result in a blockage of its wireless link, the location and orientation of

problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly considers the

spectrophotometric distance estimates for another 7. For these 235 objects, we
estimate temperatures, sift into five 150K-wide $T_{\rm eff}$ bins covering the
range 300-1050K, determine the completeness limit for each, and compute space
densities. To anchor the high-mass end of the brown dwarf mass spectrum, we
compile a list of early- to mid-L dwarfs within 20 pc. We run simulations using
various functional forms of the mass function passed through two different sets
of evolutionary code to compute predicted distributions in $T_{\rm eff}$. The
best fit of these predictions to our L, T, and Y observations is a simple
power-law model with $\alpha \approx 0.6$ (where $dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$),
meaning that the slope of the field substellar mass function is in rough
agreement with that found for brown dwarfs in nearby star forming regions and
young clusters. Furthermore, we find that published versions of the log-normal
form do not predict the steady rise seen in the space densities from 1050K to
350K. We also find that the low-mass cutoff to formation, if one exists, is
lower than $\sim$5 $M_{Jup}$, which corroborates findings in young, nearby
moving groups and implies that extremely low-mass objects have been forming
over the lifetime of the Milky Way.

scaling up in system complexity, yet they will be highly susceptible to
operational faults. While spare units can be generally used to enhance
reliability, they must be shared in a limited way among functional units to
ensure low-cost overheads when systems scale up. Furthermore, the efficiency of
achieving reliability using spare units heavily depends on the replacement
mechanisms of such spares. While global and chained replacement approaches can
take advantage of the entire replacement capabilities in the network, they
usually impose some sort of disturbance to all the functional units in the
system during the repair process, thus are dreadfully expensive in terms of
performance overhead for systems with high fault rates. In this paper, we focus
on a low-cost, fast, immediate replacement mechanism that can be implemented
locally with minimum disturbance to the system. The proposed schemes aim for
maintaining the system with high fault rates in such a low-cost, fast
repairable status for many faults before invoking the more expensive, yet
optimal, approaches. First, we propose an online repair algorithm: as faults
occur during the run-time of the system, the proposed algorithm makes a choice
of a spare unit (among several candidates), such that the overall impact on
system repairability in the future is minimized. Second, we propose a network
enhancement approach, which identifies and connects the vulnerable units to the
exploitable spares, thus strengthening the entire system at a low cost.

superalkalis. Typical superalkalis include a central electronegative core with
excess metal ligands. We propose a new series of non-metallic NnH3n+1+
superalkali cations using MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. These cations are designed
by successive replacement of H-ligands of ammonium cation (NH4+) by ammonium
(NH4) moieties. The resulting NnH3n+1+ cations, which can be expressed in the
form of [NH4 (n-1)NH3]+ complexes, possess a number of unusual N-H N type of
partially covalent H-bonds, with the interacting energy in the range 7.8-24.3
kcal/mol. These cations are stable against loss of a proton (NnH3n+H+) and loss
of ammonia [(n-1)NH3+NH4+]. The vertical electron affinities (EAv) of NnH3n+1+
decreases monotonically from 4.39 eV from n = 1 to 2.39 eV for n = 5, which
suggest their superalkali nature. This can be explained on the basis of
electron localization on core (central) N-atom (Qc), as EAv correlates linearly
with Qc. We have also demonstrated that this series may be continued to obtain
new superalkali cations with even lower EAv, by exemplifying N9H28+ with the
EAv of 1.84 eV. N9H28+ is stabilized by four partially covalent H-bonds (8.5
kcal/mol each) and four electrostatic H-bonds (0.4 kcal/mol each). This led to
an exponential relation between EAv and n, which may provide an approximate EAv
of for any value of n in NnH3n+1+ series.

excessive system resources. Our previous work adopts a data-driven deep
learning based approach which leverages the CSI at a local BS to infer the CSI
remotely, however the relevance of CSI between separated BSs is not specified
explicitly. In this paper, we exploit a model-based methodology to derive the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of remote CSI inference given the local CSI.
Although the model is simplified, the derived CRLB explicitly illustrates the
relationship between the inference performance and several key system
parameters, e.g., terminal distance and antenna array size. In particular, it
shows that by leveraging multiple local BSs, the inference error exhibits a
larger power-law decay rate (w.r.t. number of antennas), compared with a single
local BS; this explains and validates our findings in evaluating the
deep-neural-network-based (DNN-based) CSI inference. We further improve on the

inference performance of approximately $90\%$ accuracy in a realistic scenario

relative importance of these additional effects depends on the binary binding
energy and determines the timescale of the spatial mixing of FG and SG
binaries. Our simulations illustrate the role of ionization, recoil and
ejection combined with the effects of mass segregation driven by two-body
relaxation and show that the complex interplay of all these processes results
in a significant extension of the time needed for the complete spatial mixing
of FG and SG binaries compared to that of single stars. Clusters in which FG
and SG single stars have already reached complete spatial mixing might be
characterized by a significant radial gradient in the ratio of the FG-to-SG
binary fraction. The implications of the delayed mixing of FG and SG binaries
for the differences between the kinematics of the two populations are
discussed.

image with respect to a 3D model is an essential task for many applications.
When 2D-3D correspondences can be obtained reliably, perspective-n-point
solvers can be used to recover the camera pose. However, without the pose it is
non-trivial to find cross-modality correspondences between 2D images and 3D
models, particularly when the latter only contains geometric information.
Consequently, the problem becomes one of estimating pose and correspondences
jointly. Since outliers and local optima are so prevalent, robust objective
functions and global search strategies are desirable. Hence, we cast the
problem as a 2D-3D mixture model alignment task and propose the first
globally-optimal solution to this formulation under the robust $L_2$ distance
between mixture distributions. We search the 6D camera pose space using
branch-and-bound, which requires novel bounds, to obviate the need for a pose
estimate and guarantee global optimality. To accelerate convergence, we
integrate local optimization, implement GPU bound computations, and provide an
intuitive way to incorporate side information such as semantic labels. The
algorithm is evaluated on challenging synthetic and real datasets,
outperforming existing approaches and reliably converging to the global

adaptively based on the real-time learning outcomes in the given radio

surface code lattice surgery construction techniques described by Fowler et al.
to the fault-tolerant Toffoli. The resulting factory has a footprint of $12d
\times 6d$ (where $d$ is the code distance) and produces one $|CCZ\rangle$
every $5.5d$ surface code cycles. Our $|T\rangle$ state factory uses the
$|CCZ\rangle$ factory's output and a catalyst $|T\rangle$ state to exactly
transform one $|CCZ\rangle$ state into two $|T\rangle$ states. It has a
footprint 25% smaller than the factory of Fowler et al. but outputs $|T\rangle$
states twice as quickly. We show how to generalize the catalyzed transformation
to arbitrary phase angles, and note that the case $\theta=22.5^\circ$ produces
a particularly efficient circuit for producing $|\sqrt{T}\rangle$ states.
Compared to using the $12d \times 8d \times 6.5d$ $|T\rangle$ factory of Fowler

are dominated by the cost of applying Toffoli gates, including Shor's algorithm
and the chemistry algorithm of Babbush et al.. Assuming a physical gate error
rate of $10^{-3}$, our CCZ factory can produce $\sim 10^{10}$ states on average
before an error occurs. This is sufficient for classically intractable
instantiations of the chemistry algorithm, but for more demanding algorithms
such as Shor's algorithm the mean number of states until failure can be
increased to $\sim 10^{12}$ by increasing the factory footprint ~20%.

and they can survive the age of the Solar System. The nodal secular resonance
$\nu_{13}$ could vary the inclinations from $0^\circ$ to $\sim 10^\circ$
according to their initial values while $\nu_{14}$ could pump up the
inclinations to $\sim 20^\circ$ and upwards. The fine structures in the
dynamical maps are related to higher-degree secular resonances, of which
different types dominate different areas. The dynamical behaviour of the
tadpole and horseshoe orbits, reflected in their secular precession, show great
differences in the frequency space. The secular resonances involving the
tadpole orbits are more sensitive to the frequency drift of the inner planets,
thus the instabilities could sweep across the phase space, leading to the
clearance of tadpole orbits. We are more likely to find terrestrial companions
on horseshoe orbits. The Yarkovsky effect could destabilize Earth Trojans in
varying degrees. We numerically obtain the formula describing the stabilities

analyzed the distribution of GRN structural properties across a large set of

estimate the number of interactions that complete networks would have, a
valuable insight that could aid in the daunting task of network curation,

also provided new evidence to settle a previously stated controversy that
raised the possibility of complete biological networks being random and
therefore attributing the observed scale-free properties to an artifact
emerging from the sampling process during network discovery. Furthermore, we
identified a set of properties that enabled us to assess the consistency of the
connectivity distribution for various GRNs against different alternative

system's total angular momentum vector independently at different precession
rates, which causes significant disc misalignment. We derive the analytical

the planet mass and the depth/width of the induced gap, 2) the migration and
inclination damping rates for massive inclined planets, and 3) the condition
under which the inner and outer discs can break and undergo differential
precession. Then, we carry out Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations for
the simulated broken discs. Both disc shadowing in near-IR images and gas
kinematics probed by molecular lines (e.g. from ALMA) can reveal the misaligned
inner disc. The relationship between the rotation rate of the disc shadow and
the precession rate of the inner disc is also provided. Using our disc breaking
condition, we conclude that the disc shadowing due to misaligned discs should
be accompanied by deep gaseous gaps (e.g. in Pre/Transitional discs). This
scenario naturally explains both the disc shadowing and deep gaps in several
systems (e.g. HD 100453, DoAr 44, AA Tau, HD 143006) and these systems should

sells it instantaneously in the spot market. In absence of any actions of the
company, the commodity's spot price evolves either as a drifted Brownian motion
or as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. While extracting, the company affects the
market price of the commodity, and its actions have an impact on the dynamics
of the commodity's spot price. The company aims at maximizing the total
expected profits from selling the commodity, net of the total expected
proportional costs of extraction. We model this problem as a two-dimensional
degenerate singular stochastic control problem with finite fuel. To determine
its solution, we construct an explicit solution to the associated
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and then verify its actual optimality through
a verification theorem. On the one hand, when the (uncontrolled) price is a
drifted Brownian motion, it is optimal to extract whenever the current price
level is larger or equal than an endogenously determined constant threshold. On
the other hand, when the (uncontrolled) price evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process, we show that the optimal extraction rule is triggered by a curve
depending on the current level of the reservoir. Such a curve is a strictly
decreasing $C^{\infty}$-function for which we are able to provide an explicit
expression. Finally, our study is complemented by a theoretical and numerical
analysis of the dependency of the optimal extraction strategy and value
function on the model's parameters.

of spacetime at the smallest scales in terms of atoms of spacetime, capturing
their effects through a scalar $\rho$, related to their density, function of
the point $P$ and vector $v^a$ at $P$. This has been done in the Euclideanized
space one obtains through analytic continuation from Lorentzian sector at $P$.
$\rho$ has been defined in terms of a peculiar `effective' metric $q_{ab}$, of
quantum origin, introduced for spacelike/timelike separated events. This metric
stems from requiring that $q_{ab}$ coincides with $g_{ab}$ at large
(space/time) distances, but gives finite distance in the coincidence limit, and
implements directly this way one single, very basic aspect associated to any
quantum description of spacetime: length quantization. Since the latter appears
a quite common feature in the available quantum descriptions of gravity, this
quantum metric $q_{ab}$ can be suspected to have a rather general scope and to
be re-derivable (and cross-checkable) in various specific quantum models of
gravity, even markedly different one from the other.
  This work reports on an attempt to introduce a definition of $\rho$ not
through the Euclidean but directly in the Lorentz sector. This turns out to be
not a so trivial task, essentially because of the null case, meaning when $v^a$
is null, as in this case it seems we lack even a concept of $q_{ab}$. A notion
for the quantum metric $q_{ab}$ for null separated events is then proposed and
an expression for it is derived. From it, a formula for $\rho$ is deduced,
which turns out to coincide with what obtained through analytic continuation.
This virtually completes the task of having quantum expressions of any kind of
spacetime intervals, with, moreover, $\rho$ defined directly in terms of them
(not in the Euclideanized space).

the session-based recommendation to utilize extended session history and

a basis for design of control strategies relying on releases of sterile male

periodic impulsive), providing necessary conditions to reach elimination.
However, the main part of the paper is focused on the study of the periodic
impulsive control in different situations. When the size of wild mosquito
population cannot be assessed in real time, we propose the so-called open-loop
control strategy that relies on periodic impulsive releases of sterile males
with constant release size. Under this control mode, global convergence towards
the mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of sufficient condition
that relates the size and frequency of releases. If periodic assessments
(either synchronized with releases or more sparse) of the wild population size
are available in real time, we propose the so-called closed-loop control
strategy, which is adjustable in accordance with reliable estimations of the
wild population sizes. Under this control mode, global convergence to the
mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of another sufficient
condition that relates not only the size and frequency of periodic releases but
also the frequency of sparse measurements taken on wild populations. Finally,
we propose a mixed control strategy that combines open-loop and closed-loop
strategies. This control mode renders the best result, in terms of overall time
needed to reach elimination and the number of releases to be effectively
carried out during the whole release campaign, while requiring for a reasonable
amount of released sterile insects.

entropy loss and pretraining of the CNN as an autoencoder on singing voice
spectrograms. The pixel-wise classification technique directly estimates the
sound source label for each time-frequency (T-F) bin in our spectrogram image,
thus eliminating common pre- and postprocessing tasks. The proposed network is
trained by using the Ideal Binary Mask (IBM) as the target output label. The
IBM identifies the dominant sound source in each T-F bin of the magnitude
spectrogram of a mixture signal, by considering each T-F bin as a pixel with a
multi-label (for each sound source). Cross entropy is used as the training
objective, so as to minimize the average probability error between the target
and predicted label for each pixel. By treating the singing voice separation
problem as a pixel-wise classification task, we additionally eliminate one of
the commonly used, yet not easy to comprehend, postprocessing steps: the Wiener
filter postprocessing.

$H$-avoiding $k$-coloring to be a proper $k$-coloring that forbids a bicolored

  When considering the class $\mathcal C$ of graphs with no $F$ as an induced

study this phenomena for the class of graphs with no $F$ as a subgraph for

image synthesis. However, synthesizing face images that preserve facial
identity as well as have high diversity within each identity remains
challenging. To address this problem, we present FaceFeat-GAN, a novel
generative model that improves both image quality and diversity by using two
stages. Unlike existing single-stage models that map random noise to image
directly, our two-stage synthesis includes the first stage of diverse feature
generation and the second stage of feature-to-image rendering. The competitions
between generators and discriminators are carefully designed in both stages
with different objective functions. Specially, in the first stage, they compete
in the feature domain to synthesize various facial features rather than images.
In the second stage, they compete in the image domain to render photo-realistic
images that contain high diversity but preserve identity. Extensive experiments
show that FaceFeat-GAN generates images that not only retain identity
information but also have high diversity and quality, significantly
outperforming previous methods.

brain regions, which actually form complex dynamical systems operating at
multiple frequencies. These systems often consist of interacting subsystems,
whose characterization is of importance for a complete understanding of the
brain interaction processes. To address this issue, we present a technique,
namely the bispectral Pairwise Interacting Source Analysis (biPISA), for
analyzing systems of cross-frequency interacting brain sources when
multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
data are available. Specifically, the biPISA allows to identify one or many
subsystems of cross-frequency interacting sources by decomposing the
antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra between EEG or MEG signals,
based on the assumption that interactions are pairwise. Thanks to the
properties of the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra, biPISA is
also robust to spurious interactions arising from mixing artifacts, i.e. volume
conduction or field spread, which always affect EEG or MEG functional
connectivity estimates. This method is an extension of the Pairwise Interacting
Source Analysis (PISA), which was originally introduced for investigating
interactions at the same frequency, to the study of cross-frequency
interactions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in simulations
for up to three interacting source pairs, and for real MEG recordings of
spontaneous brain activity. Simulations show that the performances of biPISA in
estimating the phase difference between the interacting sources are affected by
the increasing level of noise rather than by the number of the interacting
subsystems. The analysis of real MEG data reveals an interaction between two
pairs of sources of central mu and beta rhythms, localizing in the proximity of
the left and right central sulci.

vary in the way node-to-node transmission takes place, or in the way a course
through the network is taken, thereby leading to different types of information
flow processes. When metrics are used for an inappropriate flow process, the
result of the metric can be misleading and often incorrect. In this paper we
create a simulation of the flow of information in a network, and then we
investigate the relation of information centrality as well as other network
centralities, like betweenness, closeness and eigenvector along with the
outcome of simulations with information flowing through walks rather than
paths, trails or geodesics. We find that Information Centrality is more similar
to Eigenvector and Degree centrality than to Closeness centrality as postulated

events, are at least one order of magnitude higher than all known supernova,
but can be well interpreted as the dust echoes of TDEs, whose ultra-high IR
energy is reprocessed from the dusty torus around the black hole. The torus
dust is sublimating during the early stage of the outburst and probably lead to
the observed rapid emergence of Fe II lines. Moreover, the UV-optical
rebrightening and contemporaneous X-ray onset after $\sim1500$ rest-frame days

inversion of the sign of the photocurrent and transition to its superlinear
dependence on the intensity. The photoconductivity also shows a superlinear
raise with the intensity. We show that the observed photoresponse
nonlinearities are caused by the band-to-band \emph{light} impact ionization
under conditions of a photon energy less than the forbidden gap. The signature
of this kind of impact ionization is that the angular radiation frequency
$\omega=2\pi f$ is much higher than the reciprocal momentum relaxation time.
Thus, the impact ionization takes place solely because of collisions in the
presence of a high-frequency electric field. The effect has been measured on
narrow HgTe/CdTe QWs of 5.7\,nm width; the nonlinearity is detected for
linearly and circularly polarized THz radiation with different frequencies
ranging from $f=0.6$ to 1.07\,THz and intensities up to hundreds of kW/cm$^2$.
We demonstrate that the probability of the impact ionization is proportional to

by up to 50o within ~50 us during a quench; while the cavity voltage is still
at approximately 75% of its nominal amplitude. If such a failure were to occur
on the HL-LHC crab cavities, it is likely that the machine would sustain
substantial damage to the beam line and surrounding infrastructure due to
uncontrolled beam loss before the machine protection system could dump the
beam. We have developed a low-level RF system model, including detuning
mechanisms and beam loading, and use this to simulate the behaviour of a crab
cavity during a quench, modeling the low-level RF system, detuning mechanisms
and beam loading. We supplement this with measurement data of the actual RF
response of the proof of principle Double-Quarter Wave Crab Cravity during a
quench. Extrapolating these measurements to the HL-LHC, we show that Lorentz
Force detuning is the dominant effect leading to phase shifts in the crab
cavity during quenches; rather than pressure detuning which is expected to be
dominant for the KEKB crab cavities. The total frequency shift for the HL-LHC
crab cavities during quenches is expected to be about 460 Hz, leading to a
phase shift of no more than 3o. The results of the quench model are read into a
particle tracking simulation, SixTrack, and used to determine the effect of
quenches on the HL-LHC beam. The quench model has been benchmarked against the
KEKB experimental measurements. In this paper we present the results of the
simulations on a crab cavity failure for HL-LHC as well as for the SPS and show
that beam loss is negligible when using a realistic low-level RF response.

preliminary analysis with Kadanoff coarse-graining and exact diagonalization

agreement with our numerical findings. In particular, the scaling of the
entanglement entropy as well as finite-entanglement scaling data show that the
ground state properties match those of the universality class of a $c = 1$

decay of spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlation functions, as well as the
algebraic convergence of the ground state energy with the bond dimension, and
the entanglement spectrum of half an infinite chain. Our results for the

variety of notions of process equivalence. In the particular case of labelled
transition systems, these equivalences range from trace equivalence to (strong)
bisimilarity, and are organized in what is known as the linear time --
branching time spectrum. A combination of universal coalgebra and graded monads
provides a generic framework in which the semantics of concurrency can be
parametrized both over the branching type of the underlying transition systems
and over the granularity of process equivalence. We show in the present paper
that this framework of graded semantics does subsume the most important
equivalences from the linear time -- branching time spectrum. An important
feature of graded semantics is that it allows for the principled extraction of
characteristic modal logics. We have established invariance of these graded
logics under the given graded semantics in earlier work; in the present paper,
we extend the logical framework with an explicit propositional layer and
provide a generic expressiveness criterion that generalizes the classical
Hennessy-Milner theorem to coarser notions of process equivalence. We extract
graded logics for a range of graded semantics on labelled transition systems
and probabilistic systems, and give exemplaric proofs of their expressiveness
based on our generic criterion.

identification, with estimation proceeding either via fully parametric mixture
models or two-stage least squares (TSLS). TSLS is popular but can be
problematic for binary outcomes where the estimand of interest is a causal odds
ratio. Mixture models are rarely used in practice, perhaps because of their
perceived complexity and need for specialist software. Here, we propose using
multiple imputation (MI) to impute the latent compliance class appearing in the
mixture models. Since such models include an interaction term between
compliance class and randomised treatment, we use `substantive model
compatible' MI (SMC MIC), which can also address other missing data, before
fitting the mixture models via maximum likelihood to the MI datasets and
combining results via Rubin's rules. We use simulations to compare the
performance of SMC MIC to existing approaches and also illustrate the methods
by re-analysing a RCT in UK primary health. We show that SMC MIC can be more

role in the transfer of energy from the photosphere to the corona and solar
wind, and in the heating of the chromosphere. We perform numerical computations
to investigate energy transport and dissipation associated with torsional
Alfv\'en waves propagating in magnetic flux tubes that expand from the
photosphere to the corona in quiet-Sun conditions. We place a broadband driver
at the photosphere that injects a wave energy flux of $10^7$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ and consider Ohm's magnetic diffusion and ion-neutral collisions as
dissipation mechanisms. We find that only a small fraction of the driven flux,
$\sim 10^5$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, is able to reach coronal heights, but it
may be sufficient to partly compensate the total coronal energy loss. The
frequency of maximal transmittance is $\sim 5$ mHz for a photospheric field
strength of 1 kG and is shifted to smaller/larger frequencies for
weaker/stronger fields. Lower frequencies are reflected at the transition
region, while higher frequencies are dissipated producing enough heat to
balance chromospheric radiative losses. Heating in the low and middle
chromosphere is due to Ohmic dissipation, while ion-neutral friction dominates
in the high chromosphere. Ohmic diffusion is enhanced by phase mixing because
of the expansion of the magnetic field. This effect has the important
consequence of increasing the chromospheric dissipation and, therefore,
reducing the energy flux that reaches the corona. We provide empirical fits of
the transmission coefficient that could be used as input for coronal models.

to the identification of the sphere partition function of dual theories and
being equivalent to the star-triangle relation in statistical mechanics which
corresponds to the `strongly coupled' regime of the Faddeev-Volkov model.

trials (CRTs). In these settings, the efficacy estimand may be also of
interest. Many methodological contributions in recent years have advocated
using instrumental variables to identify and estimate the local average
treatment effect (LATE). However, the clustered nature of randomisation in CRTs
adds to the complexity of such analyses.
  In this paper, we show that under certain assumptions, the LATE can be
estimated via two-stage least squares (TSLS) using cluster-level summaries of
outcomes and treatment received. Implementation needs to account for this, as
well as the possible heteroscedasticity, to obtain valid inferences.
  We use simulations to assess the performance of TSLS of cluster-level
summaries under cluster-level or individual-level non-adherence, with and
without weighting and robust standard errors. We also explore the impact of
adjusting for cluster-level covariates and of appropriate degrees of freedom
correction for inference.
  We find that TSLS estimation using cluster-level summaries provides estimates
with small to negligible bias and coverage close to nominal level, provided
small sample degrees of freedom correction is used for inference, with
appropriate use of robust standard errors. We illustrate the methods by
re-analysing a CRT in UK primary health settings.

difficult to tell whether such a high value of overshooting from the convective
core is reliable or rather mimics other mixing processes, which took place on
the whole main sequence evolution, e.g., resulting from diffusion, rotation

as a key factor for regulators' underestimation of the destructive systematic

network research either took a macro perspective to clarify the topological
properties of financial systems at a descriptive level or analyzed the risk
transmission path and characteristics of individual entities with much
pre-assumptions of the network. Here, we used the theory of complex network to
model China's credit system from 2000 to 2014 based on actual financial data. A
bipartite financial institution-firm network and its projected sub-networks
were constructed for an integrated analysis from both macro and micro
perspectives, and the relationship between typological properties and
systematic credit risk control was also explored. The typological analysis of
the networks suggested that the financial institutions and firms were highly
but asymmetrically connected, and the credit network structure made local
idiosyncratic shocks possible to proliferate through the whole economy. In
addition, the Chinese credit market was still dominated by state-owned
financial institutions with firms competing fiercely for financial resources in
the past fifteen years. Furthermore, the credit risk score (CRS) was introduced
by simulation to identify the systematically important vertices in terms of
systematic risk control. The results indicated that the vertices with more
access to the credit market or less likelihood to be a bridge in the network
were the ones with higher systematically importance. The empirical results from
this study would provide specific policy suggestions to financial regulators on

sets a long-standing puzzle, due to the peculiar anisotropic coexistence of
out-of-plane ferromagnetism and in-plane metamagnetism. Recently, the induced
magnetic structure by in-plane applied fields has been investigated by means of
spin-polarized neutron diffraction, which allowed to extract a substantial
orbital component of the magnetic densities at Ru sites. It has been argued
that the latter is at the origin of the evident layer dependent magnetic
anisotropy, where the inner layers carry larger magnetic moments than the outer
ones. We present a spin-polarized neutron diffraction study in order to
characterize the nature of the ferromagnetic state of Sr4Ru3O10, in the
presence of a magnetic field applied along the c-axis. The components of the
magnetic densities at the Ru sites reveal a vanishing contribution of the
orbital magnetic moment which is unexpected for a material system where orbital
and spin degeneracy are lifted by spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetism. We
employ a model that includes the Coulomb interaction and spin-orbit coupling at
the Ru site to address the origin of the suppression of the orbital magnetic
moment. The emerging scenario is that of non-local orbital degrees of freedom
playing a significant role in the ferromagnetic phase, with the Coulomb
interaction that is crucial to make anti-aligned orbital moments at short
distance resulting in a ground state with vanishing local orbital moments.

intelligent operating room (OR), because it is highly instrumental to analyze
and understand the surgical activities. Current methods for surgical tool
tracking in videos need to be trained on data in which the spatial positions of
the tools are manually annotated. Generating such training data is difficult
and time-consuming. Instead, we propose to use solely binary presence
annotations to train a tool tracker for laparoscopic videos. Methods: The
proposed approach is composed of a CNN + Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) neural
network trained end-to-end, but weakly supervised on tool binary presence
labels only. We use the ConvLSTM to model the temporal dependencies in the
motion of the surgical tools and leverage its spatio-temporal ability to smooth
the class peak activations in the localization heat maps (Lh-maps).
  Results: We build a baseline tracker on top of the CNN model and demonstrate
that our approach based on the ConvLSTM outperforms the baseline in tool
presence detection, spatial localization, and motion tracking by over 5.0%,
13.9%, and 12.6%, respectively.
  Conclusions: In this paper, we demonstrate that binary presence labels are
sufficient for training a deep learning tracking model using our proposed
method. We also show that the ConvLSTM can leverage the spatio-temporal
coherence of consecutive image frames across a surgical video to improve tool
presence detection, spatial localization, and motion tracking.

of energy at those high wavenumbers where viscous dissipation begins to act. It
is called the bottleneck effect. Based on direct numerical simulations of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, results from Donzis & Sreenivasan
(2010) pointed to a decrease of the strength of the bottleneck with increasing
intensity of the turbulence, measured by the Taylor micro-scale Reynolds number
$R_{\lambda}$. Here we report first experimental results on the dependence of
the amplitude of the bottleneck as a function of $R_{\lambda}$ in a wind-tunnel
flow. We used an active grid in the Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel (VDTT)
(see Bodenschatz et al. (2014)) to reach $R_{\lambda}$ > 5000, which is
unmatched in laboratory flows of decaying turbulence. The VDTT with the active
grid permitted us to measure energy spectra from flows of different
$R_{\lambda}$, with the small-scale features appearing always at the same
frequencies. We relate those spectra recorded to a common reference spectrum,
largely eliminating systematic errors which plague hotwire measurements at high
frequencies. The data are consistent with a power law for the decrease of the
bottleneck strength for the finite range of $R_{\lambda}$ in the experiment.

are non-degenerate. For $N_{f}=3$ and $C\neq{1}$, the RW transition occurs at
$\theta=\theta_{RW}=(2k+1)\pi/3\,(k\in\mathbb{Z})$, which becomes stronger with
decrease of $C$. When $C={1}$, the $\theta_{RW}$ turns into $2k\pi/3$ for

transitions get stronger with the mass mismatch. For other $C\neq{0}$ cases,
the $\theta_{RW}$'s are not integral multiples of $\pi/3$. We find that the RW
transition is more sensitive to the deviation of $C$ from one compared to the

the resistivity (TCR) method to scaled interconnect lines are discussed. The
central approximation of the TCR method, the substitution of the interconnect
wire TCR by the bulk TCR becomes doubtful when the resistivity of the conductor
metal is strongly increased by finite size effects. Semiclassical calculations
for thin films show that the TCR deviates from bulk values when the surface
roughness scattering contribution to the total resistivity becomes significant
with respect to grain boundary scattering, an effect that might become even
more important in nanowires due to their larger surface-to-volume ration. In
addition, the TCR method is redeveloped to account for line width roughness. It
is shown that for rough wires, the TCR method yields the harmonic average of
the cross-sectional area as well as, to first order, the accurate value of the
resistivity at the extracted area. Finally, the effect of a conductive barrier
or liner layer on the TCR method is discussed. It is shown that the liner or
barrier parallel conductance can only be neglected when it is lower than about
5 to 10% of the total conductance. It is furthermore shown that neglecting the
liner/barrier parallel conductance leads mainly to an overestimation of the
cross-sectional area of the center conductor whereas its resistivity is less
affected.

the most famous combinatorial games. For $n,q\in\mathbb{N}$, the
$(n,q)$-triangle game is played by two players, called Maker and Breaker, on
the complete graph $K_n$. Alternately Maker claims one edge and thereafter
Breaker claims $q$ edges of the graph. Maker wins the game if he can claim all
three edges of a triangle, otherwise Breaker wins. Chv\'{a}tal and Erd\H{o}s
(1978) proved that for $q<\sqrt{2n+2}-5/2\approx 1.414\sqrt{n}$ Maker has a
winning strategy, and for $q\geq 2\sqrt{n}$ Breaker has a winning strategy.
Since then, the problem of finding the exact leading constant for the threshold
bias of the triangle game has been one of the famous open problems in
combinatorial game theory. In fact, the constant is not known for any graph
with a cycle and we do not even know if such a constant exists. Balogh and
Samotij (2011) slightly improved the Chv\'{a}tal-Erd\H{o}s constant for
Breaker's winning strategy from $2$ to $1.935$ with a randomized approach.
Since then no progress was made. In this work, we present a new deterministic
strategy for Breaker's win whenever $n$ is sufficiently large and
$q\geq\sqrt{(8/3+o(1))n}\approx 1.633\sqrt{n}$, significantly reducing the gap
towards the lower bound. In previous strategies Breaker chooses his edges such
that one node is part of the last edge chosen by Maker, whereas the remaining
node is chosen more or less arbitrarily. In contrast, we introduce a suitable
potential function on the set of nodes. This allows Breaker to pick edges that
connect the most `dangerous' nodes. The total potential of the game may still
increase, even for several turns, but finally Breaker's strategy prevents the
total potential of the game from exceeding a critical level and leads to
Breaker's win.

the development of methods to control the transmission of an infectious agent.
Human behavior plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics and can be
used to stop a disease from spreading or to reduce its burden, as individuals
aware of the presence of a disease can take measures to reduce their exposure
to contagion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the spread of
diseases with awareness in complex networks. Unlike previous models, the
information is propagated following a generalized Maki-Thompson rumor model.
Flexibility on the timescale between information and disease spreading is also
included. We verify that the velocity characterizing the diffusion of
information awareness greatly influences the disease prevalence. We also show
that a reduction in the fraction of unaware individuals does not always imply a
decrease of the prevalence, as the relative timescale between disease and
awareness spreading plays a crucial role in the systems' dynamics. This result
is shown to be independent of the network topology. We finally calculate the
epidemic threshold of our model, and show that it does not depend on the
relative timescale. Our results provide a new view on how information influence
disease spreading and can be used for the development of more efficient methods
for disease control.

estimation from an RGB image. The core of our approach is that we first
designate a set of surface points on target object model as keypoints and then
train a keypoint detector (KPD) to localize them. Finally a PnP algorithm can
recover the 6D pose according to the 2D-3D relationship of keypoints. Different
from recent state-of-the-art CNN-based approaches that rely on a time-consuming
post-processing procedure, our method can achieve competitive accuracy without
any refinement after pose prediction. Meanwhile, we obtain a 30% relative
improvement in terms of ADD accuracy among methods without using refinement.
Moreover, we succeed in handling heavy occlusion by selecting the most
confident keypoints to recover the 6D pose. For the sake of reproducibility, we
will make our code and models publicly available soon.

successfully applied to various pattern classification tasks. Although these
methods produce sparse representations of signals which are robust against
distortions and missing data, such representations quite often turn out to be
unsuitable if the final objective is signal classification. In order to
overcome or at least to attenuate such a weakness, several new methods which
incorporate discriminative information into sparse-inducing models have emerged
in recent years. In particular, methods for discriminative dictionary learning
have shown to be more accurate (in terms of signal classification) than the
traditional ones, which are only focused on minimizing the total representation
error. In this work, we present both a novel multi-class discriminative measure
and an innovative dictionary learning method. For a given dictionary, this new
measure, which takes into account not only when a particular atom is used for
representing signals coming from a certain class and the magnitude of its
corresponding representation coefficient, but also the effect that such an atom
has in the total representation error, is capable of efficiently quantifying
the degree of discriminability of each one of the atoms. On the other hand, the
new dictionary construction method yields dictionaries which are highly
suitable for multi-class classification tasks. Our method was tested with a
widely used database for handwritten digit recognition and compared with three
state-of-the-art classification methods. The results show that our method
significantly outperforms the other three achieving good recognition rates and
additionally, reducing the computational cost of the classifier.

main challenges lie on significantly varied sizes and aspect ratios, arbitrary
orientations and shapes. Driven by recent progress in deep learning, impressive
performances have been achieved for multi-oriented text detection. Yet, the
performance drops dramatically in detecting curved texts due to the limited
text representation (e.g., horizontal bounding boxes, rotated rectangles, or
quadrilaterals). It is of great interest to detect curved texts, which are
actually very common in natural scenes. In this paper, we present a novel text
detector named TextField for detecting irregular scene texts. Specifically, we
learn a direction field pointing away from the nearest text boundary to each
text point. This direction field is represented by an image of two-dimensional
vectors and learned via a fully convolutional neural network. It encodes both
binary text mask and direction information used to separate adjacent text
instances, which is challenging for classical segmentation-based approaches.
Based on the learned direction field, we apply a simple yet effective
morphological-based post-processing to achieve the final detection.
Experimental results show that the proposed TextField outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (28% and 8%) on two curved text
datasets: Total-Text and CTW1500, respectively, and also achieves very
competitive performance on multi-oriented datasets: ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500.

to encourage the community to further reflect and act on the research
relevance. For this purpose, we have conducted a Multi-vocal Literature Review

articles). Instead of relying on and considering the individual opinions on
research relevance, mentioned in each of the sources, the MLR aims to
synthesize and provide the ""holistic"" view on the topic. The highlights of our
MLR findings are as follows. The top three root causes of low relevance,
discussed in the community, are: (1) Researchers having simplistic views (or
wrong assumptions) about SE in practice; (2) Lack of connection with industry;
and (3) Wrong identification of research problems. The top three suggestions
for improving research relevance are: (1) Using appropriate research approaches
such as action-research; (2) Choosing relevant research problems; and (3)
Collaborating with industry. By synthesizing all the discussions on this

object parts in the image space. This allows us to robustly match to the
reference objects throughout the video, because although the global appearance
of an object changes as it undergoes occlusions and deformations, the
appearance of more local parts may stay consistent. We learn these visual words

namely for any discrete process with uniformly bounded increments which admits
a regeneration structure where the regeneration times have finite moments. Here
the largest finite moment translates into the degree of regularity of the rough
path topology. In particular, the convergence holds in the $\alpha$-H\""older
rough path topology for all $\alpha<1/2$ whenever all moments are finite, which
is the case for the class of ballistic random walks in random environment. The
latter may be compared to a special class of random walks in Dirichlet

recent successes seen in Learning-based hashing methods are largely due to the
success of deep learning-based hashing methods. However, there are some
limitations to previous learning-based hashing methods (e.g., the learned hash
codes containing repetitive and highly correlated information). In this paper,
we propose a novel learning-based hashing method, named Deep Attention-guided
Hashing (DAgH). DAgH is implemented using two stream frameworks. The core idea
is to use guided hash codes which are generated by the hashing network of the
first stream framework (called first hashing network) to guide the training of
the hashing network of the second stream framework (called second hashing
network). Specifically, in the first network, it leverages an attention network
and hashing network to generate the attention-guided hash codes from the
original images. The loss function we propose contains two components: the
semantic loss and the attention loss. The attention loss is used to punish the
attention network to obtain the salient region from pairs of images; in the
second network, these attention-guided hash codes are used to guide the
training of the second hashing network (i.e., these codes are treated as
supervised labels to train the second network). By doing this, DAgH can make
full use of the most critical information contained in images to guide the
second hashing network in order to learn efficient hash codes in a true
end-to-end fashion. Results from our experiments demonstrate that DAgH can
generate high quality hash codes and it outperforms current state-of-the-art

  Variables",,,,,"stat.ME econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Can instrumental variables be found from data? While instrumental variable
(IV) methods are widely used to identify causal effect, testing their validity
from observed data remains a challenge. This is because validity of an IV
depends on two assumptions, exclusion and as-if-random, that are largely
believed to be untestable from data. In this paper, we show that under certain
conditions, testing for instrumental variables is possible. We build upon prior
work on necessary tests to derive a test that characterizes the odds of being a
valid instrument, thus yielding the name ""necessary and probably sufficient"".
The test works by defining the class of invalid-IV and valid-IV causal models
as Bayesian generative models and comparing their marginal likelihood based on
observed data. When all variables are discrete, we also provide a method to
efficiently compute these marginal likelihoods.
  We evaluate the test on an extensive set of simulations for binary data,
inspired by an open problem for IV testing proposed in past work. We find that
the test is most powerful when an instrument follows monotonicity---effect on
treatment is either non-decreasing or non-increasing---and has moderate-to-weak
strength; incidentally, such instruments are commonly used in observational
studies. Among as-if-random and exclusion, it detects exclusion violations with
higher power. Applying the test to IVs from two seminal studies on instrumental
variables and five recent studies from the American Economic Review shows that
many of the instruments may be flawed, at least when all variables are
discretized. The proposed test opens the possibility of data-driven validation
and search for instrumental variables.

proven to be difficult due to the lack of suitable probes. Radio and submm
polarization measurements constrain the flow very close to the event horizon.
X-ray observations resolving the Bondi radius yield an estimate roughly four
orders of magnitude further out. Here, we present a new, indirect measurement
of the accretion flow density at intermediate radii. We use the dynamics of the
gas cloud G2 to probe the ambient density. We detect the presence of a drag
force slowing down G2 with a statistical significance of approx 9 {\sigma}.
This probes the accretion flow density at around 1000 Schwarzschild radii and
yields a number density of approx. 4 x 10^3 cm^-3. Self-similar accretion
models where the density follows a power law radial profile between the inner

developed and used for rapid, non-invasive determination of equivalent source
models of CT scanners under clinical conditions. Standard and anthropomorphic
CT dose phantoms equipped with real-time CT dose probes at five representative
positions were scanned. The accumulated dose was measured during the scan at
the five positions. ImpactMC, a Monte Carlo-based CT dose software program, was
used to simulate the scan. The necessary inputs were obtained from the scan
parameters, from the equivalent source models and from the material-segmented
CT images of the phantoms. Post-scan 3D dose distributions in the phantoms were
simulated and the dose values calculated at the five positions inside the
phantom were compared to measured dose values. Initial results were obtained by
means of a General Electric Optima CT 660 and a Toshiba (Canon) Aquilion ONE.
In general, the measured and calculated dose values were within relative
uncertainties that had been estimated to be less than 10%. The procedures
developed, which allow the post-CT scan dose to be measured and calculated at
five points inside anthropomorphic phantoms, were found to be viable and rapid.
The procedures are applicable to any scanner type under clinical conditions.
Results show that the procedures are well suited for verifying the
applicability of personalized CT dosimetry based on post-scan Monte Carlo
calculations.

regular dynamics in low dimensions is often reduced to combinatorial
invariants. In dimension 3 combinatorial invariants are proved to be
insufficient even for simplest Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms. The complete
topological invariant for the systems with a single saddle point on the
3-sphere is the embedding of the homotopy non-trivial knot into the manifold
$\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$. If a diffeomorphism has several saddle points
their unstable separatrices form arcs frames in the basin of the sink and
circles frame in the orbits space. Thus, the type of embedding of the circles
frame into $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$ is a topological invariant for
diffeomorphisms of this kind and this type turns out to be the complete
topological invariant for some classes of Morse-Smale 3-diffeomorphisms.
Recently it was shown that the problem of embedding of a 3-diffeomorphism into
a topological flow is interconnected with the properties of embedding of the
arcs frame into the 3-Euclidean space. In this paper we consider the criteria
for the tame embedding of an arcs frame into the 3-Euclidean space as well as
for the trivial embedding of circles frame into $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$.
We apply this criteria to prove that frames of one-dimensional separatrices in
basins of sources of rough 3-diffeomorhisms with two-dimensional expanding
attractor are tamely embedded and their spaces of orbits are trivial embeddings
of circles frame into $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb S^1$.

consistent with the dynamical model where emitters rotate in circular orbits
around the galactic center. The simplest template used to fit these maps
consists in the rotating disk model (RDM) where the amplitude of circular
velocities is fixed by the observed velocity profile along the kinematic axis.
A more sophisticated template is the rotating tilted-ring model (RTRM) that
takes into account the presence of warps and allows a radius-dependent
orientation of the kinematic axis. In both cases, axisymmetry is assumed and
residuals between the observed and the model velocity fields are interpreted as
noncircular motions. We show that if a galaxy is not axisymmetric, there is an
intrinsic degeneracy between a rotational and a radial velocity field. We then
introduce a new galaxy template, the radial ellipse model (REM), that is not
axisymmetric and has a purely radial velocity field with an amplitude that is
correlated with the major axis of the ellipse. We show that best fits to the
observed two-dimensional velocity fields of 28 galaxies extracted from the
THINGS sample with both the REM and the RDM give residuals with similar
amplitudes, where the REM residuals trace nonradial motions. Best fits obtained
with the RTRM, because of its larger number of free parameters, give the
smallest residuals: however, we argue that this does not necessarily imply that
the RTRM gives the most accurate representation of a galaxy velocity field.
Instead, we show that this method is not able to disentangle between circular
and radial motions for the case of nonaxisymmetric systems. Finally, we
consider the physical motivation of the REM, and discuss how the interpretation
of galactic dynamics changes if one assumes that the main component of a galaxy
velocity field is modeled as a RDM/RTRM or as a REM.

ionospheric maps of the free electron density (based on Global Positioning

ionospheric modelling. In addition, we estimate the parameters of the
systematics and the correlated noise generated by the residual unmodelled

the whole face region (very relaxed large area). Research have shown that this

a large variation. Active research has been carried out on this topic since
past few years due to its obvious advantages over face and iris biometrics in
unconstrained and uncooperative scenarios. Many researchers have explored
periocular biometrics involving both visible (VIS) and infra-red (IR) spectrum
images. For a system to work for 24/7 (such as in surveillance scenarios), the
registration process may depend on the day time VIS periocular images (or any
mug shot image) and the testing or recognition process may occur in the night
time involving only IR periocular images. This gives rise to a challenging
research problem called the cross-spectral matching of images where VIS images
are used for registration or as gallery images and IR images are used for
testing or recognition process and vice versa. After intensive research of more
than two decades on face and iris biometrics in cross-spectral domain, a number
of researchers have now focused their work on matching heterogeneous

durations. While it was known that SVF is not always optimal, it has been
widely observed that it performs well in practice and simulation. We provide a
theoretical justification for this observation by proving, in various settings,
quantitative worst-case bounds on the ratio between the cost incurred by the
SVF rule and the minimum attainable cost. We also show that, in great
generality, SVF is asymptotically optimal, i.e., the ratio approaches 1 as the
number of patients grows large. While evaluating policies by considering an
approximation ratio is a standard approach in many algorithmic settings, our
results appear to be the first of this type in the appointment scheduling
literature.

phenomenon, that is far from being fully understood. A 2D Peierls-Nabarro
finite element (PN-FE) model for studying edge dislocation transmission across
fully coherent and non-damaging phase boundaries was recently proposed. This
paper brings a new dimension to the complexity by extending the PN-FE model
with a dedicated cohesive zone model for the phase boundary. With the proposed
model, a natural interplay between dislocations, external boundaries and the
phase boundary, including decohesion of that boundary, is provided. It allows
one to study the competition between dislocation transmission and phase
boundary decohesion. Commonly, the interface potentials required for glide
plane behaviour and phase boundary decohesion are established through atomistic
simulations. They are corresponding to the misfit energy intrinsic to a system
of two bulks of atoms that are translated rigidly with respect to each other.
It is shown that the blind utilisation of these potentials in zero-thickness
interfaces (as used in the proposed model) may lead to a large quantitative
error. Accordingly, for physical consistency, the potentials need to be reduced
towards zero-thickness potentials. In this paper a linear elastic reduction is
adopted. With the reduced potentials for the glide plane and the phase
boundary, the competition between dislocation transmission and phase boundary
decohesion is studied for an 8-dislocation pile-up system. Results reveal a
strong influence of the phase contrast in material properties as well as the
phase boundary toughness on the outcome of this competition. In the case of
crack nucleation, the crack length shows an equally strong dependency on these
properties.

has opened a new window on the many unknown aspects of their internal dynamics.
A key role in this context is played by the transition from baryon to quark
matter described in the neutron star equation of state (EoS). In particular,
the binary pulsar observation of heavy neutron stars requires appropriately
stiff dense matter in order to counter gravitational collapse, at variance with
the predictions of many phenomenological quark models. On the other side, the
LIGO observations favor a softer EoS therefore providing a lower bound to the
equation stiffness. We introduce a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) description of
the neutron star's high baryon density regime where the pressure and energy
density distributions are directly obtained from the matrix elements of the QCD
energy momentum tensor. Recent ab initio calculations allow us to evaluate the
energy-momentum tensor in a model independent way including both quark and
gluon degrees of freedom. Our approach is a first effort to replace quark
models and effective gluon interactions with a first principles, fully
QCD-based description. Most importantly, the QCD energy momentum tensor matrix
elements are connected to the Mellin moments of the generalized parton
distributions which can be measured in deeply virtual exclusive scattering
experiments. As a consequence, we establish a connection between observables
from high energy experiments and from the analysis of gravitational wave
events. Both can be used to mutually constrain the respective sets of data. In
particular, the emerging QCD-based picture is consistent with the GW170817
neutron star merger event once we allow a first-order phase transition from a
low-density nuclear matter EoS to the newly-constructed high-density
quark-gluon one.

centre of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, obtained from high-resolution
VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy. This includes abundances of Li (detected in 1 out of
99 stars), Na, $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca Ti), iron-peak elements (Sc,
Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), r- and s-process elements (Ba, La, Nd, Eu). The sample,
covering -2.3< [Fe/H]<-0.9, populates the whole metallicity distribution of the
galaxy with the exception of the very low metallicity tail. There is a marked
decrease in [$\alpha$/Fe] over our sample, from the Galactic halo plateau value
at low [Fe/H] and then, after a `knee', a decrease to sub-solar [$\alpha$/Fe]
at high [Fe/H]. This is consistent with products of core-collapse supernovae
dominating at early times, followed by the onset of supernova type Ia as early
as 12 Gyrs ago. The products from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, as
traced by the s-process, also participate in the chemical evolution of Sculptor
with a timescale comparable to that of supernovae type Ia. The r-process is
consistent with having no time delay relative to core-collapse SN at the later
stages of the chemical evolution in Sculptor. We derive empirical constraints
on the relative importance of supernovae type II and Ia to the nucleosynthesis
of individual iron-peak and $\alpha$-elements. The most important contribution
of supernovae type Ia is to the iron-peak elements: Fe, Cr and Mn; but there is
also a modest but non-negligible contribution to both the heavier
$\alpha$-elements: S, Ca and Ti, and some of the iron-peak elements: Sc and Co.
We see only very small or no contribution to O, Mg, Ni and Zn from supernovae
type Ia in Sculptor. The observed chemical abundances in Sculptor show no
evidence of a significantly different initial mass function, compared to that
of the Milky Way.

rotation axis and the rotation period of 67P/C-G. For these changes we give an
explanation based on a sublimation model with a best-fit for the surface active
fraction (model P). Torque effects of periodically changing gas emissions on
the surface are considered. (Methods) We solve the equation of state for the
angular momentum in the inertial and the body-fixed frames and provide an
analytic theory of the rotation changes in terms of Fourier coefficients,
generally applicable to periodically forced rigid body dynamics. (Results) The
torque induced changes of the rotation state constrain the physical properties
of the surface, the sublimation rate and the local active fraction of the
surface. (Conclusions) We determine a distribution of the local surface active
fraction in agreement with the rotation properties, period and orientation, of
67P/C-G. The torque movement confirms that the sublimation increases faster
than the insolation towards perihelion. The derived relatively uniform activity
pattern is discussed in terms of related surface features.

models have been able to generate small images unconditionally, but the
extension of these methods to large images where fidelity can be more readily
assessed has remained an open problem. Among the major challenges are the
capacity to encode the vast previous context and the sheer difficulty of
learning a distribution that preserves both global semantic coherence and
exactness of detail. To address the former challenge, we propose the Subscale

within a set time period. The process includes aspects of purchasing,
specifications to be met, and solicitation notifications as in the case of
Request For Proposals (RFPs). Typically such an RFP is described in a verbal ad
hoc fashion, in English, with tables and graphs, resulting in imprecise
specifications of requirements. It has been proposed that BPMN diagrams be used
to specify requirements to be included in RFP. This paper is a merger of three
topics: (i) Procurement development with a focus on operational specification
of RFP, (ii) Public key infrastructure (PKI) as an RFP subject, and (iii)
Conceptual modeling that produces a diagram as a supplement to an RFP to
clarify requirements more precisely than traditional tools such as natural
language, tables, and ad hoc graphs.

Congress investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election
campaign, with Russia accused of, among other things, using trolls (malicious
accounts created for the purpose of manipulation) and bots (automated accounts)
to spread propaganda and politically biased information. In this study, we
explore the effects of this manipulation campaign, taking a closer look at
users who re-shared the posts produced on Twitter by the Russian troll accounts
publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress investigation. We collected a dataset of 13
million election-related posts shared on Twitter in the year of 2016 by over a
million distinct users. This dataset includes accounts associated with the
identified Russian trolls as well as users sharing posts in the same time
period on a variety of topics around the 2016 elections. We use label
propagation to infer the users' ideology based on the news sources they share.
We are able to classify a large number of users as liberal or conservative with
precision and recall above 84%. Conservative users who retweet Russian trolls
produced significantly more tweets than liberal ones, about 8 times as many in
terms of tweets. Additionally, trolls' position in the retweet network is
stable over time, unlike users who retweet them who form the core of the
election-related retweet network by the end of 2016. Using state-of-the-art bot
detection techniques, we estimate that about 5% and 11% of liberal and
conservative users are bots, respectively.

signatures that could be tested by the Event Horizon Telescope and similar
future collaborations. The Newtonian potential is similarly modified, and it is
shown that for values of $\Ls$ in the range considered, the effect will emerge
at about 1~kpc from the galactic center, coincident with the flattening of the
Milky Way's rotation curve. This suggests that the EUP could contribute to dark

analytical approximations is a formidable task, but numerical solutions can be
obtained by performing some bulky double-retarded integrals. We focus on
concrete experimental situations which may allow to detect an anomalous
quasi-static magnetic field generated by these (collective) wavefunctions in
cuprate superconductors. We compute the spatial dependence of the field and its
amplitude as a function of microscopic parameters including the fraction $\eta$
of supercurrent that is not locally conserved in Josephson junctions between
grains, the thickness $a$ of the junctions and the size $\varepsilon$ of their
current sinks and sources. The results show that the anomalous field is
actually detectable at the macroscopic level with sensitive experiments, and
can be important at the microscopic level because of virtual charge effects
typical of the extended Maxwell equations.

acknowledges a privileged status of classical probability theory with respect
to statistical analysis. He also sees advantages offered by the
Contextuality-by-Default theory, notably, that it `demystifies quantum
mechanics by highlighting the role of contextuality,' and that it can detect
and measure contextuality in inconsistently connected systems. He argues,
however, that classical probability theory may have difficulties in describing
empirical phenomena if they are described entirely in terms of observable
events. We disagree: contexts in which random variables are recorded are as
observable as the variables' values. Khrennikov also argues that the
Contextuality-by-Default theory suffers the problem of non-uniqueness of
couplings. We disagree that this is a problem: couplings are all possible ways
of imposing counterfactual joint distributions on random variables that de
facto are not jointly distributed. The uniqueness of modeling experiments by
means of quantum formalisms brought up by Khrennikov is achieved for the price
of additional, substantive assumptions. This is consistent with our view of
quantum theory as a special-purpose generator of classical probabilities.
Khrennikov raises the issue of `mental signaling,' by which he means
inconsistent connectedness in behavioral systems. Our position is that it is as
inherent to behavioral systems as their stochasticity.

  constraint",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural network pruning is an important step in design process of efficient
neural networks for edge devices with limited computational power. Pruning is a
form of knowledge transfer from the weights of the original network to a
smaller target subnetwork. We propose a new method for compute-constrained
structured channel-wise pruning of convolutional neural networks. The method
iteratively fine-tunes the network, while gradually tapering the computation
resources available to the pruned network via a holonomic constraint in the
method of Lagrangian multipliers framework. An explicit and adaptive automatic
control over the rate of tapering is provided. The trainable parameters of our
pruning method are separate from the weights of the neural network, which
allows us to avoid the interference with the neural network solver (e.g. avoid
the direct dependence of pruning speed on neural network learning rates). Our
method combines the `rigoristic' approach by the direct application of
constrained optimization, avoiding the pitfalls of ADMM-based methods, like
their need to define the target amount of resources for each pruning run, and
direct dependence of pruning speed and priority of pruning on the relative
scale of weights between layers. For VGG-16 @ ILSVRC-2012, we achieve reduction
of 15.47 -> 3.87 GMAC with only 1% top-1 accuracy reduction (68.4% -> 67.4%).

produced in the pp collisions at LHC energies were analyzed . The data revealed
several $p_T$ regions, which could be characterized by the length of the
regions L and two free fitting parameters a and b. The study of the
characteristics of the regions shown that the regions are divided into two
groups. The values of the L and b for the first group don't depend on colliding
energy and the properties of the particles (though the values of a increase
linearly with energy), however, the second group regions' characteristics show
strong dependencies. We found that the ratio of the eta-mesons to neutral pions
lengths is approximately equal to the ratio of their masses. Assuming that the
L values are directly proportional to the string tension, this result could be
the evidence of parton string fragmentation dynamics, since in string theory
the masses of elementary particles and their energy are defined by the
intensity of string vibration . The increasing lengths for the eta-mesons'
regions are accompanied with increasing values of b parameter. Taking into
account that $Q^2\sim 1/b^2$ we have concluded that the eta-mesons were
produced at lesser values of $\alpha _S$ compare to neutral pions. The results
show that the lengths of the first group of regions are ~3-5 times greater than
the lengths of neighboring lower pT regions. The second group's lengths are ~ 2
times greater than the lengths of neighboring lower pT region. In the framework
of string fragmentation and hadronization dynamics, it could mean that the
group I is produced through string decay into ~ 3-5 strings, whereas group II
is produced through decay into ~2 strings. The existence of 2 groups of regions
could hint to two types of strings responsible for the observed groups.

is the high service delay where the mobile clients have to wait to view their
favorite movie.The importance of this paper is based on finding a solution on
how to reduce the delay time in the VOD system.This paper introduces a novel
caching mechanism named Proxy Server Cache mechanism to tackle the issue of
service delay.This delay happens when the broadcasting phase that is related to
the first segment is missed by a client from the current broadcasting channels.
This delay happens when the broadcasting phase that is related to the first
segment is missed by a client from the current broadcasting channels. The
delayed clients will directly acquire the first segment from the proxy server
instead of waiting for the following broadcasting channel pertaining to the
first segment. The proposed scheme ensures obtaining the first segment from
mobile clients when they arrive. Additionally, the performance of the proposed
scheme is validated by applying the VOD system, which can involve the balancing
mechanism to retain particular requests through to the local proxy server to
provide a fair dissemination for these requests. The obtained result confirms
that the proposed scheme reduces the time delay of the system in comparison
with the best existing schemes. The results of the average time delay in the
Proxy-Cache scheme is 179.2505 milliseconds when 10 clients arrive each minute
(Client/minute), the average time delay is 140 milliseconds when the video
lengths are 30, 60 and 90. Meanwhile, the failure probability for obtaining the
first segment of the video remains zero when the number of arrived requests is
set to 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.
