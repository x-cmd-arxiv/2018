both the classically held notions of being a particle and a wave, is one of the
most intriguing aspects of the quantum description of nature. These aspects
have been instrumental in understanding paradigmatic natural phenomena as well
as to provide nonclassical applications. A conceptual foundation for the wave
nature of a quantum state has recently been presented, through the notion of
quantum coherence. We introduce here a parallel notion for the particle nature
of a quantum state of an arbitrary physical system. We provide elements of a
resource theory of particleness, and give a quantification of the same.
Finally, we provide evidence for a complementarity between the particleness
thus introduced, and the coherence of an arbitrary quantum state.

under Hamiltonian dynamics in many-body systems. The hypothesis states that
successive Lanczos coefficients in the continued fraction expansion of the
Green's functions grow linearly with rate $\alpha$ in generic systems, with an
extra logarithmic correction in 1d. The rate $\alpha$ --- an experimental
observable --- governs the exponential growth of operator complexity in a sense
we make precise. This exponential growth even prevails beyond semiclassical or
large-$N$ limits. Moreover, $\alpha$ upper bounds a large class of operator
complexity measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator. As a result,
we obtain a sharp bound on Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$, which
complements and improves the known universal low-temperature bound $\lambda_L
\leq 2 \pi T$. We illustrate our results in paradigmatic examples such as
non-integrable spin chains, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, and classical models.
Finally we use the hypothesis in conjunction with the recursion method to
develop a technique for computing diffusion constants.

faster and the photons can propagate over long distances and be easily

elaborate that the most useful theoretical route to this quantity is via the
density profile at a flat wall. This is corroborated by extending the study to
curved surfaces and establishing a connection to the particle adsorption and
integrated surface excess pressure (surface tension). In the ideal-gas limit,
the effect of curvature on the mechanical properties can be calculated
analytically in the passive system with effective interactions, and shows good
(but not exact) agreement with simulations of the active models. It turns out
that even the linear correction to the pressure is model specific and equals
the planar adsorption in each case, which means that a known equilibrium sum
rule can be extended to a regime at small but nonzero activity. In turn, the
relation between the planar adsorption and the surface tension is reminiscent
of the Gibbs adsorption theorem at an effective temperature. At finite
densities, where particle interactions play a role, the presented
effective-potential approximation captures the effect of density on the
dependence of the pressure on curvature.

for field effect applications. Extrinsic doping of BLGs enriches the electronic
properties of the graphene-based family, as their behavior can be switched from
an intrinsic small-gap semiconductor to a degenerate semiconductor. In the

electronic and thermoelectric properties of BLGs doped with extrinsic
impurities from groups III (B, Al, Ga), IV (Si, Ge) and V (N, P, As), in the
context of applied external electric fields. Doping one monolayer of the BLG
with p- or n-type dopants results in a degenerate semiconductor, where the
Fermi energy depends on the type of the impurity, but also on the magnitude and
orientation of the electric field, which modifies the effective doping
concentration. Doping one layer with isoelectronic species like Si and Ge opens
a gap, which may be closed upon applying an electric field, in contrast to the
pristine BLG. Furthermore, dual doping by III-V elements, in a way that the BLG
system is formed by one n-type and one p-type graphene monolayer, leads to
intrinsic semiconductor properties with relatively large energy gaps. Si-Si and
Ge-Ge substitutions render a metallic like behavior at zero field similar to
the standard BLG, however with an asymmetric density of states in the vicinity
of the Fermi energy. We analyze the suitability of the highly doped BLG
materials for thermoelectric applications, exploiting the large asymmetries of
the density of states. In addition, a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient is
observed by tuning the electric field as a signature of narrow bands near the

with the corresponding logarithmic increase of radiative corrections in QED in

discriminating between the two alternative limits orders. As a result, we find
that the power-law scaling at asymptotically large energy scales pertains
strictly speaking only to the case of a constant crossed background field,

high dimensionality and complexity of the data. Here we present models of deep
learning (DL) and apply them to gene expression data for the diagnosis and
categorization of cancer. In this study, we have developed two DL models using
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) datasets available from the Genomic Data
Commons repository. Our models achieved 98% accuracy in cancer detection, with
false negative and false positive rates below 1.7%. In our results, we
demonstrated that 18 out of 32 cancer-typing classifications achieved more than
90% accuracy. Due to the limitation of a small sample size (less than 50
observations), certain cancers could not achieve a higher accuracy in typing
classification, but still achieved high accuracy for the cancer detection task.
To validate our models, we compared them with traditional statistical models.
The main advantage of our models over traditional cancer detection is the
ability to use data from various cancer types to automatically form features to
enhance the detection and diagnosis of a specific cancer type.

incompressible plasma flow, by constructing an Hadamard-type ill-posedness
example for the constant coefficients linearized problem we find a necessary
and sufficient condition for the violent instability of a planar plasma-vacuum

effects in observational studies when the number of potential confounders is
possibly much greater than the sample size. We first use a class of penalized
M-estimators for the propensity score and outcome models. We then calibrate the
initial estimate of the propensity score by balancing a carefully selected
subset of covariates that are predictive of the outcome. Finally, the estimated
propensity score is used to construct the inverse probability weighting
estimator. We prove that the proposed estimator, which has the sample
boundedness property, is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and
semiparametrically efficient when the propensity score model is correctly
specified and the outcome model is linear in covariates. More importantly, we
show that our estimator remains root-n consistent and asymptotically normal so
long as either the propensity score model or the outcome model is correctly
specified. We provide valid confidence intervals in both cases and further
extend these results to the case where the outcome model is a generalized
linear model. In simulation studies, we find that the proposed methodology
often estimates the average treatment effect more accurately than the existing
methods. We also present an empirical application, in which we estimate the
average causal effect of college attendance on adulthood political

interest in the dynamics of reaction-diffusion systems. However, a
comprehensive theoretical understanding of the dynamics of such highly
nonlinear, spatially extended systems is still missing. Here we show how a
description in phase space, which has proven invaluable in shaping our
intuition about the dynamics of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, can
be generalized to mass-conserving reaction-diffusion (McRD) systems. We present
a comprehensive analysis of two-component McRD systems, which serve as
paradigmatic minimal systems that encapsulate the core principles and concepts
of the local equilibria theory introduced in the paper. The key insight
underlying this theory is that shifting local (reactive) equilibria --
controlled by the local total density -- give rise to concentration gradients
that drive diffusive redistribution of total density. We show how this dynamic
interplay can be embedded in the phase plane of the reaction kinetics in terms
of simple geometric objects: the reactive nullcline and the diffusive
flux-balance subspace. On this phase-space level, physical insight can be
gained from geometric criteria and graphical constructions. The effects of
nonlinearities on the global dynamics are simply encoded in the curved shape of
the reactive nullcline. In particular, we show that the pattern-forming `Turing
instability' in McRD systems is a mass-redistribution instability, and that the
features and bifurcations of patterns can be characterized based on regional
dispersion relations, associated to distinct spatial regions (plateaus and
interfaces) of the patterns. In an extensive outlook section, we detail
concrete approaches to generalize local equilibria theory in several
directions, including systems with more than two-components, weakly-broken mass
conservation, and active matter systems.

paper, we present the first publicly available set of Deepfake videos generated
from videos of VidTIMIT database. We used open source software based on GANs to
create the Deepfakes, and we emphasize that training and blending parameters
can significantly impact the quality of the resulted videos. To demonstrate
this impact, we generated videos with low and high visual quality (320 videos
each) using differently tuned parameter sets. We showed that the state of the
art face recognition systems based on VGG and Facenet neural networks are
vulnerable to Deepfake videos, with 85.62% and 95.00% false acceptance rates
respectively, which means methods for detecting Deepfake videos are necessary.
By considering several baseline approaches, we found that audio-visual approach

and is often used in presentation attack detection domain, resulted in 8.97%
equal error rate on high quality Deepfakes. Our experiments demonstrate that

perform observations in ""wobble mode"", i.e. collecting data from the signal
region and from a corresponding background control region at the same time,
enabling efficient simultaneous determination and subtraction of background.
This observation strategy is possibly compromised in scenarios where dark
matter annihilates to long-lived mediators that can traverse astrophysical
distances before decaying to produce the gamma rays observed by the IACTs. In
this paper, we show that this challenge comes with several interesting features
and opportunities: in addition to signal contamination in the background
control region, the gamma-ray spectrum changes with the observing direction
angle and typically exhibits a hard excess at high energies. This affects
signal reconstruction via subtraction of the background control region
measurements in non-trivial ways. Such features represent a significant
departure from the canonical picture, and offer novel handles to identify a
dark matter signal and to extract underlying dark matter parameters.

must consist of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium star
companion. Based on existing explosion models invoking the pure deflagration of
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, we investigate the likelihood of producing spectral
features due to helium in type Iax supernovae. From this scenario, we select
those explosion models producing ejecta and $^{56}$Ni masses that are broadly
consistent with those estimated for type Iax supernovae (0.014 -
0.478~$M_{\odot}$ and $\sim0.003$ - 0.183~$M_{\odot}$, respectively). To this
end, we present a series of models of varying luminosities ($-18.4 \lesssim
M_{\rm{V}} \lesssim -14.5$~mag) with helium abundances accounting for up to
$\sim$36\% of the ejecta mass, and covering a range of epochs beginning a few
days before B$-$band maximum to approximately two weeks after maximum. We find
that the best opportunity for detecting \ion{He}{i} features is at
near-infrared wavelengths, and in the post-maximum spectra of the fainter
members of this class. We show that the optical spectrum of SN~2007J is
potentially consistent with a large helium content (a few 10$^{-2}~M_{\odot}$),
but argue that current models of accretion and material stripping from a
companion struggle to produce compatible scenarios. We also investigate the
presence of helium in all objects with near-infrared spectra. We show that
SNe~2005hk, 2012Z, and 2015H contain either no helium or their helium
abundances are constrained to much lower values
($\lesssim$10$^{-3}~M_{\odot}$). Our results demonstrate the differences in
helium content among type Iax supernovae, perhaps pointing to different
progenitor channels. Either SN~2007J is an outlier in terms of its progenitor
system, or it is not a true member of the type Iax supernova class.

be a polynomial of nonnegative integer coefficients. Let $\mathcal{S}_n:=\{s_1,
..., s_n\}$ and $H_f(\mathcal{S}_n):=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{f(k)^{s_{k}}}$.
When $f(x)$ is linear, Feng, Hong, Jiang and Yin proved in [A generalization of
a theorem of Nagell, Acta Math. Hungari, in press] that for any infinite
sequence $\mathcal{S}$ of positive integers, $H_f(\mathcal{S}_n)$ is never an

$0<H_f(\mathcal{S}_n)<\zeta(2)<2$. But it is not clear whether the reciprocal

that for any infinite sequence $\mathcal{S}$ of positive integers and any

Furthermore, we use a result of Kakeya to show that if
$\frac{1}{f(k)}\le\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{1}{f(k+i)}$ holds for all positive

properties. First we define the class of reciprocal bodies, which may be viewed
as convex bodies of the form ""$1/K$"". The map $K\mapsto K^\prime$ sending a
body to its reciprocal is a duality on the class of reciprocal bodies, and we
study its properties.
  To connect this new map with the classic polarity we use another
construction, associating to each convex body $K$ a star body which we call its
flower and denote by $K^\clubsuit$. The mapping $K\mapsto K^\clubsuit$ is a
bijection between the class $\mathcal{K}_0^n$ of convex bodies and the class
$\mathcal{F}^n$ of flowers. We show that the polarity map
$\circ:\mathcal{K}_0^n\to\mathcal{K}_0^n$ decomposes into two separate
bijections: First our flower map $\clubsuit:\mathcal{K}_0^n\to\mathcal{F}^n$,
followed by the spherical inversion $\Phi$ which maps $\mathcal{F}^n$ back to
$\mathcal{K}_0^n$. Each of these maps has its own properties, which combine to
create the various properties of the polarity map.
  We study the various relations between the four maps $\prime$, $\circ$,
$\clubsuit$ and $\Phi$ and use these relations to derive some of their
properties. For example, we show that a convex body $K$ is a reciprocal body if
and only if its flower $K^\clubsuit$ is convex.
  We show that the class $\mathcal{F}^n$ has a very rich structure, and is
closed under many operations, including the Minkowski addition. This structure
has corollaries for the other maps which we study. For example, we show that if
$K$ and $T$ are reciprocal bodies so is their ""harmonic sum""
$(K^\circ+T^\circ)^\circ$. We also show that the volume
$\left|\left(\sum_i\lambda_{i}K_i\right)^\clubsuit\right|$ is a homogeneous
polynomial in the $\lambda_i$'s, whose coefficients can be called
""$\clubsuit$-type mixed volumes"". Related geometric inequalities are also

an orbital instability among the giant planets triggered by gravitational
interactions between the planets and a massive exterior disk of planetesimals.
Previous works have suggested that this instability can be substantially
delayed ($\sim$100s Myr) after the formation of the giant planets. Bodies in
the disk are typically treated in a semi-active manner, wherein their
gravitational force on the planets is included, but interactions between the
planetesimals are ignored. We perform $N$-body numerical simulations using
GENGA, which makes use of GPUs to allow for the inclusion of all gravitational
interactions between bodies. Although our simulated Kuiper belt particles are
more massive than the probable masses of real primordial Kuiper belt objects,
our simulations indicate that the self-stirring of the primordial Kuiper belt
is very important to the dynamics of the giant planet instability. We find that
interactions between planetesimals dynamically heat the disk and typically
prevent the outer solar system instability from being delayed by more than a
few tens of million years after giant planet formation. Longer delays occur in
a small fraction of systems that have at least 3.5 AU gaps between the planets
and planetesimal disk. Our final planetary configurations match the solar
system at a rate consistent with other previous works in most regards.
Pre-instability heating of the disk typically yields final Jovian
eccentricities comparable to the modern solar system value, which has been a

  Applications",,,,,"cs.DS cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multilayer networks are a powerful paradigm to model complex systems, where
multiple relations occur between the same entities. Despite the keen interest
in a variety of tasks, algorithms, and analyses in this type of network, the
problem of extracting dense subgraphs has remained largely unexplored so far.
  In this work we study the problem of core decomposition of a multilayer
network. The multilayer context is much challenging as no total order exists
among multilayer cores; rather, they form a lattice whose size is exponential
in the number of layers. In this setting we devise three algorithms which
differ in the way they visit the core lattice and in their pruning techniques.
  We then move a step forward and study the problem of extracting the
inner-most (also known as maximal) cores, i.e., the cores that are not
dominated by any other core in terms of their core index in all the layers.
Inner-most cores are typically orders of magnitude less than all the cores.
Motivated by this, we devise an algorithm that effectively exploits the
maximality property and extracts inner-most cores directly, without first
computing a complete decomposition.
  Finally, we showcase the multilayer core-decomposition tool in a variety of
scenarios and problems. We start by considering the problem of densest-subgraph
extraction in multilayer networks. We introduce a definition of multilayer
densest subgraph that trades-off between high density and number of layers in
which the high density holds, and exploit multilayer core decomposition to
approximate this problem with quality guarantees. As further applications, we
show how to utilize multilayer core decomposition to speed-up the extraction of
frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques and to generalize the community-search
problem to the multilayer setting.

considerable attention in fields such as autonomous materials, sensors,

set of fluid-filled bladders, similar to a honeycomb structure, which are
interconnected via an array of slender tubes. The configuration of the
connecting tubes is arbitrary, and each tube may connect any two bladders. Beam
deformation both creates, and is induced by, the internal viscous flow- and
pressure-fields which deform the bladders and thus the surrounding solid.
Applying concepts from poroelasticity, and leveraging Cosserat beam
large-deformation models, we obtain a set of three coupled equations relating
the fluidic pressure within the bladders to the large transverse and
longitudinal displacements of the beam. We show that by changing the viscous
resistance of the connecting tubes we are able to modify the amplitude of
oscillatory deformation modes created due to external excitations on the
structure. In addition, rearranging tube configuration in a given bladder
system is shown to add an additional degree of control, and generate varying
mode shapes for the same external excitation. The presented modified Cosserat
model is applied to analyze a previously suggested energy harvester
configuration and estimate the efficiency of such a device. The results of this

of symbolic structures such as sequences and sentences; these representations
often exhibit linear regularities (analogies). Such regularities motivate our
hypothesis that RNNs that show such regularities implicitly compile symbolic
structures into tensor product representations (TPRs; Smolensky, 1990), which
additively combine tensor products of vectors representing roles (e.g.,
sequence positions) and vectors representing fillers (e.g., particular words).
To test this hypothesis, we introduce Tensor Product Decomposition Networks
(TPDNs), which use TPRs to approximate existing vector representations. We
demonstrate using synthetic data that TPDNs can successfully approximate linear
and tree-based RNN autoencoder representations, suggesting that these
representations exhibit interpretable compositional structure; we explore the
settings that lead RNNs to induce such structure-sensitive representations. By
contrast, further TPDN experiments show that the representations of four models
trained to encode naturally-occurring sentences can be largely approximated
with a bag of words, with only marginal improvements from more sophisticated
structures. We conclude that TPDNs provide a powerful method for interpreting
vector representations, and that standard RNNs can induce compositional
sequence representations that are remarkably well approximated by TPRs; at the
same time, existing training tasks for sentence representation learning may not
be sufficient for inducing robust structural representations.

to identify the major consequences of a cage-split ground multiplet: a
Schottky-like anomaly appears in the specific heat with associated reduction of
the magnetic entropy and alteration of the magnetic properties. Concomitantly,
a centrifugal Jahn-Teller effect develops that expands the distribution of the

a fundamental problem across science and engineering. In practice, we are often
interested in signals with 'simple' Fourier structure, such as bandlimited,
multiband, and Fourier sparse signals. More broadly, any prior knowledge about
a signal's Fourier power spectrum can constrain its complexity. Intuitively,
signals with more highly constrained Fourier structure require fewer samples to
reconstruct.
  We formalize this intuition by showing that, roughly, a continuous signal
from a given class can be approximately reconstructed using a number of samples
proportional to the *statistical dimension* of the allowed power spectrum of
that class. Further, in nearly all settings, this natural measure tightly
characterizes the sample complexity of signal reconstruction.
  Surprisingly, we also show that, up to logarithmic factors, a universal
non-uniform sampling strategy can achieve this optimal complexity for *any
class of signals*. We present a simple and efficient algorithm for recovering a
signal from the samples taken. For bandlimited and sparse signals, our method
matches the state-of-the-art. At the same time, it gives the first
computationally and sample efficient solution to a broad range of problems,
including multiband signal reconstruction and kriging and Gaussian process
regression tasks in one dimension.
  Our work is based on a novel connection between randomized linear algebra and
signal reconstruction with constrained Fourier structure. We extend tools based
on statistical leverage score sampling and column-based matrix reconstruction
to the approximation of continuous linear operators that arise in signal
reconstruction. We believe that these extensions are of independent interest
and serve as a foundation for tackling a broad range of continuous time
problems using randomized methods.

multiplication algorithms. Alman and Vassilevska Williams recently defined the
Universal Method, which substantially generalizes all the known approaches
including Strassen's Laser Method and Cohn and Umans' Group Theoretic Method.
We prove concrete lower bounds on the algorithms one can design by applying the
Universal Method to many different tensors. Our proofs use new tools for upper
bounding the asymptotic slice rank of a wide range of tensors. Our main result
is that the Universal method applied to any Coppersmith-Winograd tensor $CW_q$
cannot yield a bound on $\omega$, the exponent of matrix multiplication, better
than $2.16805$. By comparison, it was previously only known that the weaker
`Galactic Method' applied to $CW_q$ could not achieve an exponent of $2$.
  We also study the Laser Method (which is, in principle, a highly special case
of the Universal Method) and prove that it is ""complete"" for matrix
multiplication algorithms: when it applies to a tensor $T$, it achieves $\omega
= 2$ if and only if it is possible for the Universal method applied to $T$ to
achieve $\omega = 2$. Hence, the Laser Method, which was originally used as an
algorithmic tool, can also be seen as a lower bounding tool. For example, in
their landmark paper, Coppersmith and Winograd achieved a bound of $\omega \leq
2.376$, by applying the Laser Method to $CW_q$. By our result, the fact that
they did not achieve $\omega=2$ implies a lower bound on the Universal Method
applied to $CW_q$. Indeed, if it were possible for the Universal Method applied
to $CW_q$ to achieve $\omega=2$, then Coppersmith and Winograd's application of

GPS-enabled devices, it has become possible to crowdsource the collection of
speed information to road users (e.g. through mobile applications or dedicated
in-vehicle devices). Despite its rather wide spatial coverage, crowdsourced
speed data also brings very important challenges, such as the highly variable
measurement noise in the data due to a variety of driving behaviors and sample
sizes. When not properly accounted for, this noise can severely compromise any
application that relies on accurate traffic data. In this article, we propose
the use of heteroscedastic Gaussian processes (HGP) to model the time-varying
uncertainty in large-scale crowdsourced traffic data. Furthermore, we develop a
HGP conditioned on sample size and traffic regime (SRC-HGP), which makes use of
sample size information (probe vehicles per minute) as well as previous
observed speeds, in order to more accurately model the uncertainty in observed
speeds. Using 6 months of crowdsourced traffic data from Copenhagen, we
empirically show that the proposed heteroscedastic models produce significantly
better predictive distributions when compared to current state-of-the-art
methods for both speed imputation and short-term forecasting tasks.

for small wavevectors irrespective of the glass's stability. With increasing

anisotropy and we show that their propagation is actually strongly
nonreciprocal, as a result of dynamic dipolar interactions. We investigate
spin-wave non-reciprocity effects in single Bloch walls, which allows us to
clearly pinpoint their origin, as well as in arrays of parallel walls in stripe
domain configurations. For such arrays, a complex domain-wall-bound spin-wave
band structure develops, some aspects of which can be understood qualitatively
from the single-wall picture by considering that a wall array consists of a
sequence of up/down and down/up walls with opposite non-reciprocities.
Circumstances are identified in which the non-reciprocity is so extreme that
spin-wave propagation inside individual walls becomes unidirectional.

major importance is given to the enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, for
which enhanced diffusion has been reported even though the catalysed reaction

model-free and thus yields absolute diffusion constants. Our PFG-NMR

this effect must be applicable to de Sitter since the latter has a maximal
memory storage capacity thanks to its Gibbons-Hawking entropy. The primordial
information pattern encoded in de Sitter memory initially costs very little

the pattern grows in time and increasingly back reacts on the evaporation
process. After a finite time the memory burden becomes unbearable and de Sitter

well beyond present constraints for such heavy states. The improvement holds
also for Majorana $N$, and is largely independent of whether charged lepton
flavor is conserved or violated. The analysis, built almost entirely from
inclusive, transverse observables, is designed to be robust across increasing
collider energies, and hence serves as a basis for searches at future
colliders: With $\mathcal{L}=15~{\rm ab}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=27$ TeV, one can
probe mixing below $\vert V_{\ell N}\vert^2 = 10^{-2}
~(10^{-3})~[2\times10^{-4}]$ for $m_N \lesssim 3500~(700)~[200]$ GeV. At a
hypothetical 100 TeV $pp$ collider with $\mathcal{L}=30~{\rm ab}^{-1}$, one can
probe below $\vert V_{\ell N}\vert^2 = 9\times10^{-5}~(10^{-3})~[10^{-2}]$ for
$m_N \lesssim 200$ GeV ($4$ TeV) [$15$ TeV]. We anticipate these results can be

gravitationally coupled massive higher spin states from the on-shell point of
view. Starting with the three-point amplitude, we focus on the simplest
amplitude which is characterized by matching to minimal coupling in the UV. In
the IR such amplitude leads to g = 2 for arbitrary charged spin states, and the
best high energy behavior for a given spin. We proceed to construct the
(gravitational) Compton amplitude for generic spins. We find that the leading
deformation away from minimal coupling, in the gravitation sector, will lead to
inconsistent factorizations and are thus forbidden. As the corresponding
deformation in the gauge sector encodes the anomalous magnetic dipole moment,
this leads to the prediction that for systems with gauge2 =gravity relations,
such as perturbative string theory, all charged states must have g = 2. It is
then natural to ask for generic spin, what is the theory that yields such
minimal coupling. By matching to the one body effective action, remarkably we
verify that for large spins, the answer is Kerr black holes. This
identification is then an on-shell avatar of the no hair theorem. Finally using
this identification as well as the newly constructed Compton amplitudes, we
proceed to compute the spin dependent pieces for the classical potential at 2PM

This process involves poorly understood aspects of disordered granular matter

deformation at the particle scale of a large-grained sediment bed, under
conditions where friction dominate over cohesive and thermal forces, and with
an imposed fluid flow. Experiments are performed at conditions which span the
particle resuspension criterion, and particle motion is detected and analyzed.
The void size population and statistics of particle trajectories bring insight
to the sediment dynamics near fluidization conditions. Specifically, particle
rearrangement and net bed compaction are observed at flow rates significantly
below the criterion for instability growth. Above a threshold, a large vertical
channel through the bed forms. In the range of flow rates where channelization
can occur, the coexistence of compacting and dilating bed scenarios is
observed. The results of the study enhance our capacity for modeling of both
slow dynamics and eventual rapid destabilization of sediment beds.

should exist. We show that the extra vectors, needed for the deformation, can
not be auxiliary fields in an eventual off-shell formulation $N \geq 5$

these extra vector fields can not be dynamical either since that changes the
unitary supermultiplets underlying these theories and requires one to go beyond
the standard framework of extended simple supergravities. To show this we list
all relevant unitary conformal supermultiplets of $SU(2,2|N+n)$. We find that
doubling of vectors consistent with linearized supersymmetry requires to change
the number of scalars, violating the coset structure of the theory, and also to
add a finite number of higher spin fields, which do not admit consistent
couplings to theories with spins $\leq 2$. Thus, the proposed duality restoring
deformation along the lines of \cite{Bossard:2011ij} can not be implemented
within the standard framework of extended supergravity theories. We argue
therefore that, in the absence of anomalies, E7 type duality together with

equivalently, through a Higgs portal. Motivated by applications to experiments
such as atom interferometry, we assume that the probe field can be initialized,
by means of external driving, in a state that is not an eigenstate of the light

single-particle matrix elements of the reduced density operator of a toy model.

thermo field dynamics, used to motivate a method of
Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann-like reduction. In order to obtain

constraints. These generally have instantiations in both classical and quantum
dynamics (Noether's theorem, for instance, applies to both sorts of dynamics).
We here provide an example of such a constraint which has no counterpart for a
classical system, that is, a uniquely quantum consequence of symmetric
dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate the impossibility of broadcasting
asymmetry (symmetry-breaking) relative to a continuous symmetry group, for
bounded-size quantum systems. The no-go theorem states that if two initially
uncorrelated systems interact by symmetric dynamics and asymmetry is created at
one subsystem, then the asymmetry of the other subsystem must be reduced. We
also find a quantitative relation describing the tradeoff between the
subsystems. These results cannot be understood in terms of additivity of
asymmetry, because, as we show here, any faithful measure of asymmetry violates
both sub-additivity and super-additivity. Rather, they must be understood as a
consequence of an (intrinsically quantum) information-disturbance principle.
Our result also implies that if a bounded-size quantum reference frame for the
symmetry group, or equivalently, a bounded-size reservoir of coherence (e.g., a
clock with coherence between energy eigenstates in quantum thermodynamics) is
used to implement any operation that is not symmetric, then the quantum state
of the frame/reservoir is necessarily disturbed in an irreversible fashion,

variety of quantum systems. Great efforts have recently been devoted to its
extension to quantum computing for efficiently solving static many-body

first review the conventional variational principles, including the
Rayleigh-Ritz method for solving static problems, and the Dirac and Frenkel
variational principle, the McLachlan's variational principle, and the
time-dependent variational principle, for simulating real time dynamics. We
focus on the simulation of dynamics and discuss the connections of the three
variational principles. Previous works mainly focus on the unitary evolution of
pure states. In this work, we introduce variational quantum simulation of mixed
states under general stochastic evolution. We show how the results can be
reduced to the pure state case with a correction term that takes accounts of
global phase alignment. For variational simulation of imaginary time evolution,
we also extend it to the mixed state scenario and discuss variational Gibbs
state preparation. We further elaborate on the design of ansatz that is
compatible with post-selection measurement and the implementation of the
generalised variational algorithms with quantum circuits. Our work completes
the theory of variational quantum simulation of general real and imaginary time
evolution and it is applicable to near-term quantum hardware.

The algorithm exposes a large number of offensive associations related to

light of the widespread use of word embeddings. The associations are identified
by geometric patterns in word embeddings that run parallel between people's

does not even require the sensitive features to be pre-specified. This is
desirable because: (a) many forms of discrimination--such as racial
discrimination--are linked to social constructs that may vary depending on the
context, rather than to categories with fixed definitions; and (b) it makes it
easier to identify biases against intersectional groups, which depend on
combinations of sensitive features. The inputs to our algorithm are a list of
target tokens, e.g. names, and a word embedding. It outputs a number of Word

Waals (vdW) crystals can be modified substantially by Moir\'e superlattice
potentials arising from an interlayer twist between crystals. Moir\'e-tuning of
the band structure has led to the recent discovery of superconductivity and
correlated insulating phases in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) near the
so-called ""magic angle"" of $\sim$1.1{\deg}, with a phase diagram reminiscent of
high T$_c$ superconductors. However, lack of detailed understanding of the
electronic spectrum and the atomic-scale influence of the Moir\'e pattern has
so far precluded a coherent theoretical understanding of the correlated states.
Here, we directly map the atomic-scale structural and electronic properties of
TBLG near the magic angle using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
(STM/STS). We observe two distinct van Hove singularities (vHs) in the LDOS
which decrease in separation monotonically through 1.1{\deg} with the bandwidth
(t) of each vHs minimized near the magic angle. When doped near half Moir\'e
band filling, the conduction vHs shifts to the Fermi level and an additional
correlation-induced gap splits the vHs with a maximum size of 7.5 meV. We also
find that three-fold (C$_3$) rotational symmetry of the LDOS is broken in doped
TBLG with a maximum symmetry breaking observed for states near the Fermi level,
suggestive of nematic electronic interactions. The main features of our doping
and angle dependent spectroscopy are captured by a tight-binding model with
on-site (U) and nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions. We find that the ratio
U/t is of order unity, indicating that electron correlations are significant in
magic angle TBLG. Rather than a simple maximization of the DOS,
superconductivity arises in TBLG at angles where the ratio U/t is largest,
suggesting a pairing mechanism based on electron-electron interactions.

horizon, the continuation enables computation of the Schwinger-Keldysh
generating functional using derivative expansion, drastically simplifying
calculations. We illustrate the prescription with two-point functions for a
scalar operator. We then use it to derive from gravity the recently proposed
non-equilibrium effective action for diffusion.

until they move back down the WD cooling track, and we consider several
possible WD masses and explosion energies. To predict the peculiar surface
abundances of the WD postgenitors, our models take into account gravitational
settling and radiative levitation. We find that radiative levitation is
significant at temperatures above a mass-dependent critical temperature,

abundances of iron-group elements. Due to enhanced iron group opacity compared
to normal WDs, the postgenitor peak luminosity and cooling timescale depend
sensitively on mass, with more massive WDs becoming brighter but cooling much
faster. We discuss our results in light of recently discovered hypervelocity
white dwarfs with peculiar surface compositions, finding that our low-mass
postgenitor models match many of their observational characteristics. Finally,

Universe dynamics of the dark sector can be particularly complex, as the dark

double Compton scattering and bremsstrahlung, whose amplitudes are cumbersome

$\Gamma_{\rm SFR}^{\rm SD}$, and {\it ii)} a ""quenching"" criterion based on a
minimum threshold for the specific SFR of $\lesssim$ 10$^{-11}\rm yr^{-1}$. We
find that a large fraction of galaxies ($\gtrsim 60\%$) suffer their
$\Gamma_{\rm SFR}^{\rm SD}$ outside the cluster's R$_{200}$. This
``pre-processed"" population is dominated by galaxies that are either low mass
and centrals or inhabit low mass hosts ($10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot} \lesssim$ M$_{\rm

and galaxies that suffered their $\Gamma_{\rm SFR}^{\rm SD}$ in massive hosts
($10^{13.5}\rm M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{host} \lesssim 10^{14.0}M_{\odot}$) are
mainly processed within the clusters. Pre-processing mainly limits the total
stellar mass with which galaxies arrive in the clusters. Regarding quenching,
galaxies preferentially reach this state in high-mass halos ($10^{13.5}\rm
M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{host} \lesssim 10^{14.5}M_{\odot}$). The small fraction
of galaxies that reach the cluster already quenched has also been
pre-processed, linking both criteria as different stages in the quenching
process of those galaxies. For the $z=0$ satellite populations, we find a sharp
rise in the fraction of quenched satellites at the time of first infall,
highlighting the role played by the dense cluster environment. Interestingly,
the fraction of pre-quenched galaxies rises with final cluster mass. This is a
direct consequence of the hierarchical cosmological model used in these

mechanical model, the inverted harmonic oscillator. Through this
correspondence, we argue that radiation phenomena in gravitational situations,
such as presented by W. G. Unruh and S. Hawking, bears a parallel with
saddle-potential scattering of quantum Hall quasiparticles. We also find that
scattering by the quantum Hall saddle potential can mimic the signature
quasinormal modes in black holes, such as theoretically demonstrated through
Gaussian scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole by C. V. Vishveshwara. We
propose a realistic quantum Hall point contact setup for probing these
temporally decaying modes in quasiparticle tunneling, offering a new mesoscopic
parallel for black hole ringdown.

period of 4391 days or 12.0 yr, the longest for any SyXB, and far longer than
the 404 day orbit commonly cited for this system in the literature. In addition
to the 12.0 yr orbital period we find a shorter period of 420 days, similar to
the one previously found. Instead of orbital motion, we attribute this much
shorter period to long secondary pulsation of the M3 III SRb variable. Our new
orbit supports earlier work that concluded that the orbit is seen nearly pole
on, which is why X-ray pulsations associated with the NS have not been
detected. We estimate an orbital inclination of 11.3$^\circ$ $\pm$ 0.4$^\circ$.
Arguments are made that this low inclination supports a pulsation origin for
the 420 day long secondary period. We also measure CNO and Fe peak abundances
of the M giant and find it to be slightly metal poor compared to the Sun with
no trace of the NS forming SN event. Basic properties of the M giant and NS are
derived. We discuss the possible evolutionary paths that this system has taken

to the rate constants of these reactions. More concretely, we find that a

change in resonance frequency is not due to tip-sample interactions, but rather
due to the cantilever strain or geometric effects and thus the resonance
frequency being a function of the oscillation amplitude. Our numerical
calculations demonstrate that the amplitude dependence of the resonance
frequency is an additional yet overlooked systematic error source that can
result nonnegligible errors in measured interaction potentials and forces. Our
experimental results and complementary numerical calculations reveal that the

paired data that consist of pre- and post-treatment measurements. In this
framework, sequential testing strategies are widely accepted statistical tools
in practice. Since performances of parametric sequential testing procedures
vitally depend on the validity of the parametric assumptions regarding
underlying data distributions, we focus on distribution-free mechanisms for
sequentially evaluating treatment effects. In fixed sample size designs, the
density-based empirical likelihood (DBEL) methods provide powerful
nonparametric approximations to optimal Neyman-Pearson type statistics. In this
article, we extend the DBEL methodology to develop a novel sequential DBEL
testing procedure for detecting treatment effects based on paired data. The
asymptotic consistency of the proposed test is shown. An extensive Monte Carlo
study confirms that the proposed test outperforms the conventional sequential
Wilcoxon signed-rank test across a variety of alternatives. The excellent
applicability of the proposed method is exemplified using the

Chlorhexidine Gluconate treatment in reducing oral colonization by pathogens in

a theoretical analysis showing that enhanced particle settling speeds in
turbulence occur through the preferential sweeping mechanism, which depends on
the preferential sampling of the fluid velocity gradient field by the inertial
particles. However, recent Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results in
\citet[J. Fluid Mech., 796:659--711]{ireland16b} show that even in a portion of
the parameter space where this preferential sampling is absent, the particles
nevertheless exhibit enhanced settling velocities. Further, there are several
outstanding questions concerning the role of different turbulent flow scales on
the enhanced settling, and the role of the Taylor Reynolds number $R_\lambda$.
The analysis of Maxey does not explain these issues, partly since it was
restricted to particle Stokes numbers $St\ll1$. To address these issues, we
have developed a new theoretical result, valid for arbitrary $St$, that reveals
the multiscale nature of the mechanism generating the enhanced settling speeds.
In particular, it shows how the range of scales at which the preferential
sweeping mechanism operates depends on $St$. This analysis is complemented by
results from DNS where we examine the role of different flow scales on the
particle settling speeds by coarse-graining the underlying flow. The results
show how the flow scales that contribute to the enhanced settling depend on
$St$, and that contrary to previous claims, there can be no single turbulent
velocity scale that characterizes the enhanced settling speed. The results
explain the dependence of the particle settling speeds on $R_\lambda$, and show
how the saturation of this dependence at sufficiently large $R_\lambda$ depends

azimuthal drift and diffusion rates, as well as coherence times of the LSC. In

mitigate the dependency on source examples. Our work leads to a new formulation

of allele-specific gene-expression through pyrosequencing was conducted on
mouse crosses of an uncharacterized parent with known carriers. Our Bayesian
analysis is suitable for this adaptive experimental design, accounting for the
biases and differences in precision among genes. Model identifiability is
facilitated by priors constrained to a manifold. We show that reparameterized
slice-sampling can suitably tackle a general class of constrained priors. We

entanglement of quantum systems is hard to preserve for a long time period due
to decoherence and dephasing mainly caused by radiative and nonradiative
losses. In this work, we outperform the aforementioned limitations by
presenting efficient long-range inter-emitter entanglement and large
enhancement of resonance energy transfer between two optical qubits mediated by
epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and other plasmonic waveguide types, such as V-shaped
grooves and cylindrical nanorods. More importantly, we explicitly demonstrate
that the ENZ waveguide resonant energy transfer and entanglement performance
drastically outperforms the other waveguide systems. Only the excited ENZ mode
has an infinite phase velocity combined with a strong and homogeneous electric
field distribution, which leads to a giant energy transfer and efficient
entanglement independent to the emitters separation distances and nanoscale
positions in the ENZ nanowaveguide, an advantageous feature that can
potentially accommodate multi-qubit entanglement. Moreover, the transient
entanglement can be further improved and become almost independent of the
detrimental decoherence effect when an optically active (gain) medium is
embedded inside the ENZ waveguide. We also present that efficient steady-state
entanglement can be achieved by using a coherent external pumping scheme.
Finally, we report a practical way to detect the steady-state entanglement by
computing the second-order correlation function. The presented findings stress

Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) scheme in NB-IoT cannot provide connectivity

NB-IoT, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), introduced for the fifth
generation wireless networks, is deemed to significantly improve the network
capacity by providing massive connectivity through sharing the same spectral
resources. To leverage NOMA in the context of NB-IoT, we propose a power domain
NOMA scheme with user clustering for an NB-IoT system. In particular, the MTC
devices are assigned to different ranks within the NOMA clusters where they
transmit over the same frequency resources. Then, we formulate an optimization
problem to maximize the total throughput of the network by optimizing the
resource allocation of MTC devices and NOMA clustering while satisfying the
transmission power and quality of service requirements. We prove the
NP-hardness of the proposed optimization problem. We further design an
efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem by
jointly optimizing NOMA clustering and resource allocation of MTC devices.
Furthermore, we prove that the reduced optimization problem of power control is
a convex optimization task. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the

end-to-end communication systems. One fundamental problem of such systems is
how to increase the transmission rate. Two new schemes are proposed to address
the limited data rate issue: adaptive transmission scheme and generalized data
representation (GDR) scheme. In the first scheme, an adaptive transmission is
designed to select the transmission vectors for maximizing the data rate under
different channel conditions. The block error rate (BLER) of the first scheme
is 80% lower than that of the conventional one-hot vector scheme. This implies
that higher data rate can be achieved by the adaptive transmission scheme. In
the second scheme, the GDR replaces the conventional one-hot representation.
The GDR scheme can achieve higher data rate than the conventional one-hot
vector scheme with comparable BLER performance. For example, when the vector
size is eight, the proposed GDR scheme can double the date rate of the one-hot
vector scheme. Besides, the joint scheme of the two proposed schemes can create
further benefits. The effect of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed for
these DL-based communication systems. Numerical results show that training the
autoencoder using data set with various SNR values can attain robust BLER
performance under different channel conditions.

for the top k (usually 10) documents and then re-rank using a new query model
based on those judgments. Even though this is effective, there has been little
research recently on this topic because requiring users to provide substantial
feedback on a result list is impractical in a typical web search scenario. In
new environments such as voice-based search with smart home devices, however,
feedback about result quality can potentially be obtained during users'
interactions with the system. Since there are severe limitations on the length
and number of results that can be presented in a single interaction in this
environment, the focus should move from browsing result lists to iterative
retrieval and from retrieving documents to retrieving answers. In this paper,
we study iterative relevance feedback techniques with a focus on retrieving
answer passages. We first show that iterative feedback is more effective than
the top-k approach for answer retrieval. Then we propose an iterative feedback
model based on passage-level semantic match and show that it can produce
significant improvements compared to both word-based iterative feedback models

carriers. This corresponds to extension from the L\'evy flights-based transport
to the transport of the type, which belongs to the class of ""L\'evy walk +
rests"", to allow for the retardation effects in the L\'evy flights. This
problem covers the cases of the transport by the resonant photons in
astrophysical gases and plasmas, heat transport by electromagnetic waves in
plasmas, migration of predators, and other applications. We treat a model case
of one-dimensional transport on a uniform background with a simple power-law
step-length probability distribution function (PDF). A solution for arbitrary
superdiffusive PDF is suggested, and the verification of solution for a
particular power law PDF, which corresponds, e.g., to the Lorentzian wings of
atomic spectral line shape for emission of photons, is carried out using the
computation of the exact solution.

of noise was found by consideration of the propagation paths of radar

the noise and the location of its source. The method was particularly well
suited for daytime situations which had to be limited for the most part to only
two crossings through the D region. Knowing the radio path was used to
determine an equivalent vertical propagation attenuation factor. The change in
the noise during solar flares was correlated with solar radiation lines
measured by GOES/XRS, GOES/EUVS, SDO/AIA, SDO/EVE, SOHO/SEM and PROBA2/LYRA

a moderate isospin asymmetry between ground states of $^{11}$O and $^{11}$Li

will use the sum of the expected first hitting times to the stubborn nodes as
an objective function for a minimization problem. Its solution is a set with
the fastest convergence rate. We present a polynomial time method for obtaining
approximate solutions of the optimization problem for fixed cardinality less

matrix for the random walk is irreducible and reversible, we also obtain an

threshold mass. Taylor & Kobayashi (2014) introduced a new model, which seeds
black holes at $10^3\, h^{-1}\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ based on gas properties alone,
and motivated by the channel of black hole formation due to the collapse of the
most massive first stars in the Universe. We compare the black hole mass when
the dark matter halo mass is $10^{10}\, h^{-1}\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ between the
different seeding methods. We find that seeding based upon gas properties gives
a distribution of black hole masses with $\langle \log M_{\rm{BH}} {/
\rm{M}_{\odot}} \rangle = (5.18 \pm 0.54)$ when dark matter halo mass is
$10^{10}\, h^{-1}\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$, consistent with the {seeding criteria}
used in other simulations. However, the evolution of individual galaxies can be
strongly affected by the different seeding mechanisms. We also find that the
mean value of the distribution of black hole masses at a given halo mass
evolves over time, with higher masses at higher redshifts, indicative of
downsizing. Our results can inform more physically motivated black hole and AGN
feedback models in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models.

systems in the presence of spatially correlated fading. In particular, we focus
on the strong spatial correlation regimes where the covariance matrix of each
user channel vector has a rank that scales sublinearly with the number of base
station antennas, as the latter grows to infinity. We also consider the case
where the covariance eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues
span randomly selected subspaces. For this channel model, referred to as the
""random sparse angular support"" model, we characterize the asymptotic capacity
scaling law in the limit of large number of antennas. To achieve the asymptotic
capacity results, statistical spatial despreading based on the second-order
channel statistics plays a pivotal role in terms of pilot decontamination and
interference suppression. A remarkable result is that even when the number of
users scales linearly with base station antennas, a linear growth of the
capacity with respect to the number of antennas is achievable under the sparse
angular support model. We note that the achievable rate lower bound based on
massive MIMO ""channel hardening"", widely used in the massive MIMO literature,
yields rather loose results in the strong spatial correlation regimes and may
significantly underestimate the achievable rate of massive MIMO. This work
therefore considers an alternative bounding technique which is better suited to
the strong correlation regimes. In fading channels with sparse angular support,
it is further shown that spatial despreading (spreading) in uplink (downlink)
has a more prominent impact on the performance of massive MIMO than channel
hardening.

semi-gauge invariance. We find the condition for the conjecture to hold. This
is a set of equations for the generating function of the transformation,

The above condition reduces the range of gauge theories where Dirac's

attractive in the $^{36}$S+$^{206}$Pb reaction due to two more neutrons in

caused by the difference between the $N/Z$-ratios in the light fragments of the

dominant transport at below dc=14 nm. Quantitative arguments are made as to how
the contribution of itinerant carrier number (n) can be suppressed, using both
R_H^2D (n_Hall^2D) and SdH (n_SdH). Intriguingly, the value of n_Hall^2D
approaches to be twice of n_SdH below dc. While R_H^2D shows a negative sign in

clearly observed for S at high temperatures when d is thick. We point out that
this inconsistency observed between R_H^2D and S is intrinsic in 3D-TIs and its
origin is the large difference in carrier mobility between the bulk and the

world-wide. The disease can remain asymptomatic until severe, and an estimated
50%-90% of people with glaucoma remain undiagnosed. Glaucoma screening is
recommended for early detection and treatment. A cost-effective tool to detect
glaucoma could expand screening access to a much larger patient population, but
such a tool is currently unavailable. We trained a deep learning algorithm
using a retrospective dataset of 86,618 images, assessed for glaucomatous optic
nerve head features and referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON). The
algorithm was validated using 3 datasets. For referable GON, the algorithm had
an AUC of 0.945 (95% CI, 0.929-0.960) in dataset A (1205 images, 1
image/patient; 18.1% referable), images adjudicated by panels of Glaucoma

significantly higher sensitivity than 7 of 10 graders not involved in

between countries. It is widely acknowledged to be integral to the process of
human development as it plays a significant role in enhancing educational
outcomes. At regional and national levels, internal migration underpins the
efficient functioning of the economy by bringing knowledge and skills to the
locations where they are needed. It is the multi-dimensional nature of
migration that underlines its significance in the process of human development.
Human mobility extends in the spatial domain from local travel to international
migration, and in the temporal dimension from short-term stays to permanent
relocations. Classification and measurement of such phenomena is inevitably
complex, which has severely hindered progress in comparative research, with
very few large-scale cross-national comparisons of migration. The linkages
between migration and education have been explored in a separate line of
inquiry that has predominantly focused on country-specific analyses as to the
ways in which migration affects educational outcomes and how educational
attainment affects migration behaviour. A recurrent theme has been the
educational selectivity of migrants, which in turn leads to an increase of
human capital in some regions, primarily cities, at the expense of others.
Questions have long been raised as to the links between education and migration
in response to educational expansion, but have not yet been fully answered
because of the absence, until recently, of adequate data for comparative
analysis of migration. In this paper, we bring these two separate strands of
research together to systematically explore links between internal migration
and education across a global sample of 57 countries at various stages of
development, using data drawn from the IPUMS database.

are aligned parallel to the low-density parts (traced by $^{12}$CO map) of the

high-density core structures (traced by $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O maps).

A strong modification in the spin-wave spectra is obtained with the variation
in the antidot diameter as well as with the strength and orientation of the
bias magnetic field. A broad band of modes is observed for the lattice with
higher antidot diameter which decreases systematically as the antidot diameter
is reduced. A crossover between the higher frequency branches is achieved in
lattices with higher antidot diameter. In addition, the spin-wave modes in all
lattices show a strong six-fold anisotropic behaviour due to the variation of
internal field distribution as a function of the bias-field orientation. A mode
hopping-like behavior is observed in the angular dispersions of spin-wave
spectra for samples having intermediate hole diameters. Micromagnetic
simulations qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed spin-wave modes
and the simulated mode profiles reveal the presence of extended and quantized
standing spin-wave modes in these lattices. These observations are significant
for large tunability and anisotropic propagation of spin waves in GHz frequency
magnetic devices.

attention over the last decade. Most cascade prediction works target on
predicting cascade-level macroscopic properties such as the final size of a
cascade. Existing microscopic cascade prediction models which focus on
user-level modeling either make strong assumptions on how a user gets infected
by a cascade or limit themselves to a specific scenario where ""who infected
whom"" information is explicitly labeled. The strong assumptions oversimplify
the complex diffusion mechanism and prevent these models from better fitting
real-world cascade data. Also, the methods which focus on specific scenarios
cannot be generalized to a general setting where the diffusion graph is
unobserved.
  To overcome the drawbacks of previous works, we propose a Neural Diffusion
Model (NDM) for general microscopic cascade prediction. NDM makes relaxed
assumptions and employs deep learning techniques including attention mechanism
and convolutional network for cascade modeling. Both advantages enable our
model to go beyond the limitations of previous methods, better fit the
diffusion data and generalize to unseen cascades. Experimental results on
diffusion prediction task over four realistic cascade datasets show that our
model can achieve a relative improvement up to 26% against the best performing
baseline in terms of F1 score.

the resulting spectrally-reduced graphs can robustly preserve the first few

addition, the spectral graph reduction method has been leveraged to develop
much faster algorithms for multilevel spectral graph partitioning as well as
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) of large data sets. We
conducted extensive experiments using a variety of large graphs and data sets,

regression. For uniform deterministic and random designs in $[0,1]^d$ with
$d\ge 2$ and $N(0,1)$ noise, the minimax rate for the $\ell_2$ risk is known to
be bounded from below by $n^{-1/d}$ when the unknown mean function $f$ is
nondecreasing and its range is bounded by a constant, while the least squares
estimator (LSE) is known to nearly achieve the minimax rate up to a factor
$(\log n)^\gamma$ where $n$ is sample size, $\gamma = 4$ in the lattice design
and $\gamma = \max\{9/2, (d^2+d+1)/2 \}$ in the random design. Moreover, the
LSE is known to achieve the adaptation rate $(K/n)^{-2/d}\{1\vee
\log(n/K)\}^{2\gamma}$ when $f$ is piecewise constant on $K$ hyperrectangles in
a partition of $[0,1]^d$.
  Due to the minimax theorem, the LSE is identical on every design point to
both the max-min and min-max estimators over all upper and lower sets
containing the design point. This motivates our consideration of estimators
which lie in-between the max-min and min-max estimators over possibly smaller
classes of upper and lower sets, including a subclass of block estimators.
Under a $q$-th moment condition on the noise, we develop $\ell_q$ risk bounds
for such general estimators for isotonic regression on graphs. For uniform
deterministic and random designs in $[0,1]^d$ with $d\ge 3$, our $\ell_2$ risk
bound for the block estimator matches the minimax rate $n^{-1/d}$ when the
range of $f$ is bounded and achieves the near parametric adaptation rate
$(K/n)\{1\vee\log(n/K)\}^{d}$ when $f$ is $K$-piecewise constant. Furthermore,
the block estimator possesses the following oracle property in variable
selection: When $f$ depends on only a subset $S$ of variables, the $\ell_2$
risk of the block estimator automatically achieves up to a poly-logarithmic
factor the minimax rate based on the oracular knowledge of $S$.

This superwind shows basic characteristics similar to those of the prototypical
superwind in the starburst galaxy M82, such as a kpc-scale extended structure
of gas and dust along the disk minor axis, outflowing components (multiphase
gas and dust), physical conditions of the ionized gas, and monotonically
blueshifting radial velocity field with increasing distance from the nucleus on
the front side of the superwind. We also detected a moderately extinct

powerful enough to drive the superwind within the dynamical age of the

graph into clusters, i.e. disjoint subsets of vertices, such that each cluster
is well connected internally while sparsely connected to the rest of the graph.
In particular, we use a natural bicriteria notion motivated by Kannan, Vempala,
and Vetta which we refer to as {\em expander decomposition}. Expander
decomposition has become one of the building blocks in the design of fast graph
algorithms, most notably in the nearly linear time Laplacian solver by Spielman
and Teng, and it also has wide applications in practice.
  We design algorithm for the parametrized version of expander decomposition,
where given a graph $G$ of $m$ edges and a parameter $\phi$, our algorithm
finds a partition of the vertices into clusters such that each cluster induces
a subgraph of conductance at least $\phi$ (i.e. a $\phi$ expander), and only a
$\widetilde{O}(\phi)$ fraction of the edges in $G$ have endpoints across
different clusters. Our algorithm runs in $\widetilde{O}(m/\phi)$ time, and is
the first nearly linear time algorithm when $\phi$ is at least $1/\log^{O(1)}
m$, which is the case in most practical settings and theoretical applications.
Previous results either take $\Omega(m^{1+o(1)})$ time, or attain nearly linear
time but with a weaker expansion guarantee where each output cluster is
guaranteed to be contained inside some unknown $\phi$ expander. Our result
achieve both nearly linear running time and the strong expander guarantee for
clusters. Moreover, a main technique we develop for our result can be applied
to obtain a much better \emph{expander pruning} algorithm, which is the key
tool for maintaining an expander decomposition on dynamic graphs. Finally, we
note that our algorithm is developed from first principles based on relatively
simple and basic techniques, thus making it very likely to be practical.

(BH) procedure under arbitrary dependence of the $p$-values. This theorem
offers a principled and flexible approach to linking all $p$-values and the
null $p$-values from the FDR control perspective, suggesting a profound
implication that, to a large extent, the FDR of the BH procedure relies mostly
on the null $p$-values. To illustrate the use of this theorem, we propose a new
type of dependence only concerning the null $p$-values, which, while strictly
\textit{relaxing} the state-of-the-art PRDS dependence (Benjamini and
Yekutieli, 2001), ensures the FDR of the BH procedure below a level that is
independent of the number of hypotheses. This level is, furthermore, shown to
be optimal under this new dependence structure. Next, we present a concept
referred to as \textit{FDR consistency} that is weaker but more amenable than
FDR control, and the \texttt{FDR-linking} theorem shows that FDR consistency is
completely determined by the joint distribution of the null $p$-values, thereby
reducing the analysis of this new concept to the global null case. Finally,
this theorem is used to obtain a sharp FDR bound under arbitrary dependence,

lambda temperature. By a thought experiment in which the pressure difference
between two ends of a capillary slowly oscillates, the spectrum of fluidity
(the reciprocal of kinematic viscosity) just above the lambda temperature
($2.17 K<T<2.18 K$) is examined using a sum rule that incorporates the result
of linear response theory and fluid mechanics. According to Feynman's picture
on the many-body wave function of bosons, as the condensate grows in the flow,
the transverse motion in the flow becomes suppressed by the emergence of a gap,
originating from the Bose statistics, in the excitation spectrum. This
statistical gap induces a continuous change in the fluidity spectrum just above
the lambda temperature, which demonstrates the growth of a superfluid flow. For
this mechanism, the size distribution of the coherent wave function plays an
important role. As a byproduct, a new interpretation of the critical velocity
is proposed.

regulator to guide the MF-Stream to learn densely semantically aligned features

only the MF-Stream is needed, which makes the inference system computationally

due to the heterogeneity and resource constraints of the IoT devices. Device
classification methods are employed to enhance the security of IoT by detecting
unregistered devices or traffic patterns. In recent years, blockchain has
received tremendous attention as a distributed trustless platform to enhance
the security of IoT. Conventional device identification methods are not
directly applicable in blockchain-based IoT as network layer packets are not
stored in the blockchain. Moreover, the transactions are broadcast and thus
have no destination IP address and contain a public key as the user identity,
and are stored permanently in blockchain which can be read by any entity in the
network. We show that device identification in blockchain introduces privacy
risks as the malicious nodes can identify users' activity pattern by analyzing
the temporal pattern of their transactions in the blockchain. We study the
likelihood of classifying IoT devices by analyzing their information stored in
the blockchain, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its
kind. We use a smart home as a representative IoT scenario. First, a blockchain
is populated according to a real-world smart home traffic dataset. We then
apply machine learning algorithms on the data stored in the blockchain to
analyze the success rate of device classification, modeling both an informed
and a blind attacker. Our results demonstrate success rates over 90\% in
classifying devices. We propose three timestamp obfuscation methods, namely
combining multiple packets into a single transaction, merging ledgers of
multiple devices, and randomly delaying transactions, to reduce the success
rate in classifying devices. The proposed timestamp obfuscation methods can
reduce the classification success rates to as low as 20%.

can access the target data during the training phase, while the target data is
totally unseen during the training phase in DG. The task of DG is challenging
as we have no earlier knowledge of the target samples. If DA methods are
applied directly to DG by a simple exclusion of the target data from training,
poor performance will result for a given task. In this paper, we tackle the
domain generalization challenge in two ways. In our first approach, we propose
a novel deep domain generalization architecture utilizing synthetic data
generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The discrepancy between
the generated images and synthetic images is minimized using existing domain
discrepancy metrics such as maximum mean discrepancy or correlation alignment.
In our second approach, we introduce a protocol for applying DA methods to a DG

source data to training and validation parts, and treating the validation data

  Implications","18 pages",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a common view in thermodynamics that the behavior of a macroscopic
system can be described by only a few state variables. Although this is true
for many cases, it is unclear whether it is meaningful to ask how many state
variables are acceptable. This is indeed a problem when solids are investigated
within the framework of thermodynamics, which is scarcely discussed in
textbooks. The present study gives an answer to this question: the mean values
of all the atom positions of a given solid together with the internal energy
constitute a commensurate set of state variables (thermodynamic coordinates,
TCs). The argument begins with constructing consistent definitions of
equilibrium and TCs. TCs are created by the constraints which characterize the
system under consideration. The values of TCs are uniquely determined in
equilibrium and the mutual relationships between them constitute the
fundamental relation of equilibrium (FRE). Specific heat can be deduced from
the FRE. Therefore, the TCs of a solid must be to give a full expression of the
specific heat in the entire range of temperature, from which the above
conclusion is deduced. Contrary to the conventional view, an infinite number of
the atom positions and their microscopic characters do not conflict with the
principles of thermodynamics. The most important requirement for TCs to meet is
the uniqueness of their values in equilibrium against random motions of the
constituent particles. This conclusion is compatible with the principle of
information theory that the information needed to determine the probability
distribution of states is the expectation values of statistical variables. A
few working examples of TCs in solids are given.

GANs have shown amazing results at generating realistic looking images. Despite
their success, GANs suffer from critical drawbacks including: unstable training
and mode-dropping. The weaknesses in GANs have motivated research into
alternatives including: variational auto-encoders (VAEs), latent embedding
learning methods (e.g. GLO) and nearest-neighbor based implicit maximum

significantly outperform the alternative methods for image generation. In this
work, we present a novel method - Generative Latent Nearest Neighbors (GLANN) -
for training generative models without adversarial training. GLANN combines the
strengths of IMLE and GLO in a way that overcomes the main drawbacks of each
method. Consequently, GLANN generates images that are far better than GLO and
IMLE. Our method does not suffer from mode collapse which plagues GAN training
and is much more stable. Qualitative results show that GLANN outperforms a

Also, we identify the connection between double robustness and variance

sequence information. One way to approach this problem is to first estimate
event-labeled gene trees (i.e., rooted trees whose non-leaf vertices are
labeled by speciation or gene duplication events), and to then look for a
species tree which can be reconciled with this tree through a
\emph{reconciliation map} between the trees. In practice, however, it can
happen that there is no such map from a given event-labeled tree to \emph{any}
species tree. An important situation where this might arise is where the
species evolution is better represented by a \emph{network} instead of a tree.
In this paper, we therefore consider the problem of reconciling event-labeled
trees with species networks. In particular, we prove that any event-labeled
gene tree can be reconciled with some network and that, under certain mild
assumptions on the gene tree, the network can even be assumed to be multi-arc
free. To prove this result, we show that we can always reconcile the gene tree
with some multi-labeled (MUL-)tree, which can then be ""folded up"" to produce
the desired reconciliation and network. In addition, we study the interplay
between reconciliation maps from event-labeled gene trees to MUL-trees and
networks. Our results could be useful for understanding how genomes have
evolved after undergoing complex evolutionary events such as polyploidy.

momentum spontaneously changes its sign as observed in the experiments of

implementation, allowing users to conveniently build a private LoRa network for
various IoT applications. Firstly, several typical application scenarios of
LoRa network are discussed. Then, the LoRa system architecture is presented
with the functionality of each component. We address the hardware design and
implementation of LoRa Gateway, which is the bridge between LoRa nodes and LoRa
network server. Especially, the paper contributes by proposing an improved
software architecture of LoRa network server whose source codes are open on
GitHub. Under the architecture, LoRa network server is divided into four
decoupled modules and uses the messaging system based on streaming data for the
interaction between modules to guarantee scalability and flexibility. Finally,
extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of LoRa

dynamics model that describes both contest and scramble intraspecific

generally lead to different degrees of inequality in the resource distribution

However, among various first-principles derivations of this model, none is
consistent with this expectation. This paper explores whether a Hassell model
with an exponent related to inequality in resource allocation can be derived
from first principles. Indeed, such a Hassell model can be derived by assuming
random competition for resources among the individuals wherein each individual
can obtain only a fixed amount of resources at a time. Changing the size of the
resource unit alters the degree of inequality, and the exponent changes
accordingly. The Beverton-Holt and Ricker models can be regarded as special
cases of the derived Hassell model. Two additional Hassell models are derived
under some modified assumptions.

configuration that maximizes the long-term average number of served IoT devices

complexity of searching for optimal configuration, we first develop real-time
configuration selection based on the tabular Q-learning (tabular-Q), the Linear
Approximation based Q-learning (LA-Q), and the Deep Neural Network based
Q-learning (DQN) in the single-parameter single-group scenario. Our results
show that the proposed reinforcement learning based approaches considerably

LA-Q and DQN via Actions Aggregation (AA-LA-Q and AA-DQN) and via Cooperative
Multi-Agent learning (CMA-DQN) for the multi-parameter multi-group scenario,
thereby solve the problem that Q-learning agents do not converge in

estimation of model parameters for Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). DBNs are
directed graphical models of stochastic processes that encompasses and
generalize Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs).
Whenever we apply these models to economics and finance, we are forced to make
some modeling assumptions about the state dynamics and the graph topology (the
DBN structure). These assumptions may be incorrectly specified and contain some
additional noise compared to reality. Trying to use a best fit approach through
maximum likelihood estimation may miss this point and try to fit at any price
these models on data. We present here a new methodology that takes a radical
point of view and instead focus on the final efficiency of our model.
Parameters are hence estimated in terms of their efficiency rather than their
distributional fit to the data. The resulting optimization problem that
consists in finding the optimal parameters is a hard problem. We rely on
Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) method to tackle this
issue. We apply this method to the seminal problem of trend detection in
financial markets. We see on numerical results that the resulting parameters
seem less error prone to over fitting than traditional moving average cross
over trend detection and perform better. The method developed here for
algorithmic trading is general. It can be applied to other real case
applications whenever there is no physical law underlying our DBNs.

for tasks with either sparse rewards or long term information. In this work, we
introduce a novel on-policy temporally consistent exploration strategy - Neural
Adaptive Dropout Policy Exploration (NADPEx) - for deep reinforcement learning
agents. Modeled as a global random variable for conditional distribution,
dropout is incorporated to reinforcement learning policies, equipping them with
inherent temporal consistency, even when the reward signals are sparse. Two
factors, gradients' alignment with the objective and KL constraint in policy
space, are discussed to guarantee NADPEx policy's stable improvement. Our
experiments demonstrate that NADPEx solves tasks with sparse reward while naive
exploration and parameter noise fail. It yields as well or even faster
convergence in the standard mujoco benchmark for continuous control.

of the field strength and inclination of $\approx 300$ G and $\approx

$\approx 10^{\circ}$ in the chromosphere. Besides, we estimated the vertical
gradient of the magnetic field strength in the studied penumbra: we find a
value of $\approx 0.3$ G km$^{-1}$ between the photosphere and the middle

simple combinations of blackbody and power law models, showed that its X-ray
flux can be decomposed in a pulsed thermal plus an unpulsed non-thermal
components. However, if PSR B0943+10 is a nearly aligned rotator seen pole-on,
as suggested by the radio data, it is difficult to reproduce the high observed
pulsed fraction unless magnetic beaming is included. In this work we reanalyze
all the available X-ray observations of PSR B0943+10 with simultaneous radio
coverage, modeling its thermal emission with polar caps covered by a magnetized
hydrogen atmosphere or with a condensed iron surface. The condensed surface
model provides good fits to the spectra of both pulsar modes, but, similarly to
the blackbody, it can not reproduce the observed pulse profiles, unless an
additional power law with an ad hoc modulation is added. Instead, the pulse
profiles and phase-resolved spectra are well described using the hydrogen
atmosphere model to describe the polar cap emission, plus an unpulsed power
law. For the X-ray brighter state (Q-mode) we obtain a best fit with a
temperature kT~0.09 keV, an emitting radius R~260 m, a magnetic field
consistent with the value of the dipole field of 4x10^12 G inferred from the
timing parameters, and a small angle between the magnetic and spin axis,
$\xi$=5. The corresponding parameters for the X-ray fainter state (B-mode) are
kT~0.08 keV and R~170 m.

droplet is subjected to a transverse electric field in the presence of an
imposed pressure driven flow. For the present study, a leaky dielectric model
have been taken into consideration. When a concentric compound droplet migrates
in a pressure driven flow, the inner droplet shifts from the concentric
position and forms a eccentric configuration that finally leads to the rupture
of the outer shell. The present investigation have uncovered that the temporal
evolution of droplet eccentricity as well as the kinetics of the thinning of
the outer droplet are markedly influenced by the strength of the electric field
as well as the electric properties of the system. The present study also shows
that the conversion of different modes of droplet pinch-off mode , such as the
equatorial cap breaking-off or the hole-puncturing mode can be attained by
altering the electric field strength and its electrical properties. Finally the
present study depicts that these factors also alter the pinch-off time as well

assuming that the unknown non-perturbative corrections lead to fixing size of

both t-channel and s-channel unitarity, and can be used for summing all

presents a new explanation extraction method called LEAFAGE, for a prediction
made by any black-box ML model. The explanation consists of the visualization
of similar examples from the training set and the importance of each feature.
Moreover, these explanations are contrastive which aims to take the
expectations of the user into account. LEAFAGE is evaluated in terms of
fidelity to the underlying black-box model and usefulness to the user. The
results showed that LEAFAGE performs overall better than the current

user interfaces of Android apps are perceived more ugly than beautiful. Yet,

seeded with 10% density perturbations at the finest initial grid level (0.29pc)
around n_H = 1.1cm^{-3} and evolved with self-gravity included. No magnetic
field was imposed. Resimulations at a higher resolution of a region extracted
from this simulation (down to 0.039pc), show that the thermal instability forms
sheets, then filaments and finally clumps. The width of the filaments increases
over time, in one particular case from 0.26 to 0.56pc. Thereafter clumps with
sizes of around 5pc grow at the intersections of filaments. 21 distinct clumps,
with properties similar to those observed in molecular clouds, are found by
using the FellWalker algorithm to find minima in the gravitational potential.
Not all of these are gravitationally bound, but the convergent nature of the
flow and increasing central density suggest they are likely to form stars.
Further simulation of the most massive clump shows the gravitational collapse
to a density >10^6 cm^{-3}. These results provide realistic initial conditions
that can be used to study feedback in individual clumps, interacting clumps and
the entire molecular cloud complex.

To ease the patient's burden and to increase the efficiency and robustness of

and self-gating has been growing in recent years. Self-gating methods extract
the cardiac and respiratory signals from the measurement data and then
retrospectively sort the data into cardiac and respiratory phases. Repeated
breathholds and synchronization with the heart beat using some external device
as required in conventional MRI are then not necessary. In this work, we
introduce a novel self-gating method for radially acquired data based on a
dimensionality reduction technique for time-series analysis (SSA-FARY).
Building on Singular Spectrum Analysis, a zero-padded, time-delayed embedding
of the auto-calibration data is analyzed using Principle Component Analysis. We
demonstrate the basic functionality of SSA-FARY using numerical simulations and
apply it to in-vivo cardiac radial single-slice bSSFP and Simultaneous
Multi-Slice radiofrequency-spoiled gradient-echo measurements, as well as to
Stack-of-Stars bSSFP measurements. SSA-FARY reliably detects the cardiac and
respiratory motion and separates it from noise. We utilize the generated
signals for high-dimensional image reconstruction using parallel imaging and
compressed sensing with in-plane wavelet and (spatio-)temporal total-variation

the order book change as well. We then look at how these spread changing events
affect the prices of stocks, by means of the price response. We not only see
that the self-response of stocks is positive for both spread changing trades

other stocks and therefore the market as a whole. In addition, the
self-response function of spread-changing trades is similar to that of all

discovery and development. However, current absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion prediction models still have limited accuracy. Aim: This
study aims to construct an integrated transfer learning and multitask learning
approach for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship models to
predict four human pharmacokinetic parameters. Methods: A pharmacokinetic
dataset included 1104 U.S. FDA approved small molecule drugs. The dataset
included four human pharmacokinetic parameter subsets (oral bioavailability,
plasma protein binding rate, apparent volume of distribution at steady-state
and elimination half-life). The pre-trained model was trained on over 30
million bioactivity data. An integrated transfer learning and multitask
learning approach was established to enhance the model generalization. Results:
The pharmacokinetic dataset was split into three parts (60:20:20) for training,
validation and test by the improved Maximum Dissimilarity algorithm with the
representative initial set selection algorithm and the weighted distance
function. The multitask learning techniques enhanced the model predictive
ability. The integrated transfer learning and multitask learning model
demonstrated the best accuracies, because deep neural networks have the general
feature extraction ability, transfer learning and multitask learning improved
the model generalization. Conclusions: The integrated transfer learning and
multitask learning approach with the improved dataset splitting algorithm was
firstly introduced to predict the pharmacokinetic parameters. This method can
be further employed in drug discovery and development.

different sample thickness. The films with the lower Sr content (0.2) act as
insulators in the used temperature range. The MCD spectra have been decomposed
to the Gaussian-shaped lines, and the temperature dependence of intensity of

temperature behavior of the intensity of four specified Gaussian-lines was
revealed for semiconductor films. In the case of insulating Pr0.8Sr0.2MnO3

that the lanthanide (La, Pr) type does not affect the MCD spectra shape for the

the network Hebbian-learns during the awake state (thus behaving as a standard
Hopfield model), then, during its sleep state, optimizing information storage,
it consolidates pure patterns and removes spurious ones: this forces the
synaptic matrix to collapse to the projector one (ultimately approaching the
Kanter-Sompolinksy model). This procedure keeps the learning Hebbian-based (a
biological must) but, by taking advantage of a (properly stylized) sleep phase,
still reaches the maximal critical capacity (for symmetric interactions). So
far this emerging picture (as well as the bulk of papers on unlearning
techniques) was supported solely by mathematically-challenging routes, e.g.
mainly replica-trick analysis and numerical simulations: here we rely
extensively on Guerra's interpolation techniques developed for neural networks
and, in particular, we extend the generalized stochastic stability approach to
the case. Confining our description within the replica symmetric approximation
(where the previous ones lie), the picture painted regarding this
generalization (and the previously existing variations on theme) is here
entirely confirmed. Further, still relying on Guerra's schemes, we develop a
systematic fluctuation analysis to check where ergodicity is broken (an
analysis entirely absent in previous investigations). We find that, as long as
the network is awake, ergodicity is bounded by the Amit-Gutfreund-Sompolinsky
critical line (as it should), but, as the network sleeps, sleeping destroys
spin glass states by extending both the retrieval as well as the ergodic
region: after an entire sleeping session the solely surviving regions are
retrieval and ergodic ones and this allows the network to achieve the perfect
retrieval regime (the number of storable patterns equals the number of neurons
in the network).

spontaneously broken and the fermion in the chiral superfield becomes a

the vacua become unstable due to the presence of the ghost Goldstino if the

strings and the double copy, can be generalised to scattering in curved
backgrounds. In the first part of this thesis, a heterotic ambitwistor string
model coupled to a non-abelian background gauge field is constructed. It is
shown that after decoupling gravity this model is anomaly free if and only if
the background field is a solution to the Yang-Mills equations. A fixed gluon
vertex operator for the aforementioned heterotic model as well as a vertex
operator encoding graviton, B-field and dilaton for type II ambitwistor strings
in a curved background are presented. It is shown that they are BRST closed if
and only if they correspond to physical on-shell states. In the second part,
sandwich plane waves are considered. It is shown that scattering of gluons and
gravitons is well defined on these backgrounds. 3-point amplitudes are
calculated using quantum field theory techniques and a double copy relation
between gluons on a gauge theory plane wave and gravitons on a gravitational
plane wave is proposed. Using the results from the first part of this thesis,
it is then shown that curved background heterotic and type II ambitwistor

symmetry, the spectrum of these models possesses degeneracies with
multiplicities $2^N$ for positive integer $N$. We construct the elements of the

Hamiltonians that break the degeneracies and allow an integrable interpolation

  Summation-by-Parts Property for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is focused on the entropy analysis of a semi-discrete nodal
discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) on moving meshes for
hyperbolic conservation laws. The DGSEM is constructed with a local
tensor-product Lagrange-polynomial basis computed from Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto
(LGL) points. Furthermore, the collocation of interpolation and quadrature
nodes is used in the spatial discretization. This approach leads to discrete
derivative approximations in space that are summation-by-parts (SBP) operators.
On a static mesh, the SBP property and suitable two-point flux functions, which
satisfy the entropy condition from Tadmor, allow to mimic results from the
continuous entropy analysis on the discrete level. In this paper, Tadmor's
condition is extended to the moving mesh framework. Based on the moving mesh
entropy condition, entropy conservative two-point flux functions for the
homogeneous shallow water equations and the compressible Euler equations are
constructed. Furthermore, it will be proven that the semi-discrete moving mesh
DGSEM is an entropy conservative scheme when a two-point flux function, which
satisfies the moving mesh entropy condition, is applied in the split form DG
framework. This proof does not require any exactness of quadrature in the
spatial integrals of the variational form. Nevertheless, entropy conservation
is not sufficient to tame discontinuities in the numerical solution and thus
the entropy conservative moving mesh DGSEM is modified by adding numerical
dissipation matrices to the entropy conservative fluxes. Then, the method
becomes entropy stable such that the discrete mathematical entropy is bounded
at any time by its initial and boundary data when the boundary conditions are
specified appropriately. The theoretical properties of the moving mesh DGSEM
will be validated by numerical experiments for the compressible Euler
equations.

independent checks of the cosmic flatness. Such late-universe constraints on
$\Omega_k$, however, are sensitive to the assumptions of the nature of dark
energy. For minimally coupled scalar-field models of dark energy, the equation
of state $w$ has nontrivial dependence on the cosmic spatial curvature
$\Omega_k$ (Miao and Huang, 2018). Such dependence has not been taken into

use the $w$ parameterization proposed by Miao and Huang, where the dependence

obtained. Our analytical results reveal that: i) The FD-based RS schemes obtain
a zero diversity order, which is due to the influence of loop interference (LI)

diversity order of $K$, which is equal to the number of relays. Finally,
simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The FD-based RS schemes have better
outage performance than HD-based RS schemes in the low signal-to-noise radio

considered are capable of achieving the lower outage probability; and 3) The

  Today there are two groups of studies: in one of them scientists go from
analyzing of bubble dynamics (thus they proceed from the late stages), while in
another one scientists investigate early stages of ablation. In the present
paper we consider the process as whole: from ablation and up to formation of a
bubble and its inflation. Thus we cover extremely wide range of spatiotemporal
scales. We consider role of absorbed energy and duration of pulse (femtosecond,
multi-picosecond, nanosecond). Importance of supercritical states is
emphasized. Diffusive atomic and hydrodynamic mixing due to Rayleigh-Taylor
instability and their mutual interdependence are described. Liquid near contact
with metal is heated by dissipation in strong shock and due to small but finite
heat conduction in liquid; metal absorbing laser energy is hot and thus it
serves as a heater for liquid. Spatial expansion and cooling of atomically
mixed liquid and metal causes condensation of metal into NPs when pressure
drops below critical pressure for metal. Development of bubble takes place
during the next stages of decrease of pressure below critical parameters for
liquid and below ambient pressure in liquid. Thin hot layer of liquid near
contact expands in volume to many orders of magnitude filling the inflating

Hauck","A Mapping Study on Software Process Self-Assessment Methods","32 pag",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Assessing processes is one of the best ways for an organization to start a
software process improvement program. An alternative for organizations seeking
for lighter assessments methods is to perform self-assessments, which can be
carried out by an organization to assess its own process. In this context, the
question that arises is which software process self-assessment methods exist
and which kind of support they provide? To answer this question, a mapping
study on software process self-assessment methods was performed. As result, a
total of 33 methods were identified and analyzed, synthesizing information on
their measurement framework, process reference model and assessment process. We
observed that most self-assessment methods are based on consolidated models,
such as CMMI or ISO/IEC 15504 with a trend to develop self-assessment methods
specifically for SMEs. In general, they use simplified assessment processes,
focusing on data collection and analysis. Most of the methods propose to
collect data through questionnaires that are answered by managers or other team
members related to the process being assessed. However, we noted a lack of
information on how most of the assessment methods (AMs) have been developed and
validated, which leaves their validity questionable. The results of our study
may help practitioners, interested in conducting software process
self-assessments, to choose a self-assessment method. This research is also
relevant for researchers, as it provides a better understanding of the existing
self-assessment methods and their strengths and weaknesses.

neuromodulation, the biological mechanism that dynamically controls intrinsic
properties of neurons and their response to external stimuli in a
context-dependent manner. In this paper, we take inspiration from cellular
neuromodulation to construct a new deep neural network architecture that is
specifically designed to learn adaptive behaviours. The network adaptation
capabilities are tested on navigation benchmarks in a meta-reinforcement
learning context and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Results show
that neuromodulation is capable of adapting an agent to different tasks and
that neuromodulation-based approaches provide a promising way of improving

Although examples of noise tolerant self-testing are known, it is not clear how
to deal efficiently with a finite number of experimental trials to certify the
average quality of a device without assuming that it behaves identically at
each run. As a result, existing self-testing results with finite statistics
have been limited to guarantee the proper working of a device in just one of
all experimental trials, thereby limiting their practical applicability. We
here derive a method to certify through self-testing that a device produces
states on average close to a Bell state without assumption on the actual state
at each run. Thus the method is free of the I.I.D. (independent and identically
distributed) assumption. Applying this new analysis on the data from a recent
loophole-free Bell experiment, we demonstrate the successful distribution of
Bell states over 398 meters with an average fidelity of $\geq$55.50% at a
confidence level of 99%. Being based on a Bell test free of detection and
locality loopholes, our certification is evidently device-independent, that is,
it does not rely on trust in the devices or knowledge of how the devices work.
This guarantees that our link can be integrated in a quantum network for
performing long-distance quantum communications with security guarantees that
are independent of the details of the actual implementation.

pattern recognition tasks. Among these networks, deep kernels are particularly
interesting and effective, however, their computational complexity is a major
issue especially on cheap hardware resources. In this paper, we address the
issue of efficient computation in deep kernel networks. We propose a novel
framework that reduces dramatically the complexity of evaluating these deep
kernels. Our method is based on a coarse-to-fine cascade of networks designed
for efficient computation; early stages of the cascade are cheap and reject
many patterns efficiently while deep stages are more expensive and accurate.
The design principle of these reduced complexity networks is based on a variant
of the cross-entropy criterion that reduces the complexity of the networks in
the cascade while preserving all the positive responses of the original kernel
network. Experiments conducted - on the challenging and time demanding change
detection task, on very large satellite images - show that our proposed
coarse-to-fine approach is effective and highly efficient.

indexing with mismatches and differences. In this problem we are given a long
string of length $n$, the ""text"", and the task is to preprocess it into a data
structure such that given a query string $Q$, one can quickly identify
substrings that are within Hamming or edit distance at most $k$ from $Q$. This
problem is at the core of various problems arising in biology and text
processing. While exact text indexing allows linear-size data structures with
linear query time, text indexing with $k$ mismatches (or $k$ differences) seems
to be much harder: All known data structures have exponential dependency on $k$
either in the space, or in the time bound. We provide conditional and
pointer-machine lower bounds that make a step toward explaining this
phenomenon. We start by demonstrating lower bounds for $k = \Theta(\log n)$. We
show that assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, any data structure
for text indexing that can be constructed in polynomial time cannot have
$\mathcal{O}(n^{1-\delta})$ query time, for any $\delta>0$. This bound also
extends to the setting where we only ask for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate
solutions for text indexing. However, in many applications the value of $k$ is
rather small, and one might hope that for small~$k$ we can develop more
efficient solutions. We show that this would require a radically new approach
as using the current methods one cannot avoid exponential dependency on $k$
either in the space, or in the time bound for all even $\frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}
\sqrt{\log n} \le k = o(\log n)$. Our lower bounds also apply to the dictionary
look-up problem, where instead of a text one is given a set of strings.

make a significant contribution for understanding the attenuation of ground

compared with four ground-motion prediction equations developed for interface
earthquakes, the global Abrahamson et al. (2016) model, the Japanese equations
Zhao et al. (2006) and Ghofrani and Atkinson (2014), and one Chilean equation
Montalva et al. (2016). The four tested GMPEs are providing rather close
predictions for the mainshock at distances up to 200km. However, our results
show that high-frequency attenuation is greater for backarc sites, thus
Zetal2016 and Metal2016, which are not taking into account this difference, are
not considered further. Residual analyses show that G&A14 and Aetal2016 are
well predicting the attenuation of ground motions for the mainshock.
Comparisons of aftershock observations with Aetal2016 predictions indicate that
the GMPE provide reasonable fit to the attenuation rates observed. The event
terms of the Mw6.7 and Mw6.9 events are positive but within the expected
scatter from worldwide similar earthquakes. The intra-event standard deviations
are higher than the intraevent variability of the model, which is partly
related to the poorly constrained VS30 proxys.

time-consuming. In contrast, deep learning methods have fast testing speed but
the performance of these CNNs is still inferior. To address this issue, here we
propose a novel deep residual learning model that combines the dilated residual

learn those patterns and enlarge the receptive field. Specifically, the
residual connection and batch normalization are utilized to speed up the

Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification for insulators and superconductors.
In particular, charge conjugation is defined in terms of transposition rather
than complex conjugation due to the lack of Hermiticity, and hence chiral
symmetry becomes distinct from sublattice symmetry. It is also shown that
non-Hermiticity enables a Hermitian-conjugate counterpart of the
Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry. Taking into account sublattice symmetry or
pseudo-Hermiticity as an additional symmetry, the total number of symmetry
classes is 38 instead of 10, which describe intrinsic non-Hermitian topological
phases as well as non-Hermitian random matrices. Furthermore, due to the
complex nature of energy spectra, non-Hermitian systems feature two different
types of complex-energy gaps, point-like and line-like vacant regions. On the
basis of these concepts and K-theory, we complete classification of
non-Hermitian topological phases in arbitrary dimensions and symmetry classes.
Remarkably, non-Hermitian topology depends on the type of complex-energy gaps
and multiple topological structures appear for each symmetry class and each
spatial dimension, which are also illustrated in detail with concrete examples.
Moreover, the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems is
elucidated within our framework, and symmetries preventing the non-Hermitian
skin effect are identified. Our classification not only categorizes recently
observed lasing and transport topological phenomena, but also predicts a new
type of symmetry-protected topological lasers with lasing helical edge states
and dissipative topological superconductors with nonorthogonal Majorana edge
states. Furthermore, our theory provides topological classification of
Hermitian and non-Hermitian free bosons.

immersive stereoscopic teleperception and a teleoperation control. This robot
is designed with the capability to perform safely a casualty-extraction
procedure. We have built a proof-of-concept mobile rescue robot called ResQbot
for the experimental platform. An approach called ""loco-manipulation"" is used
to perform the casualty-extraction procedure using the platform. The
performance of this robot is evaluated in terms of task accomplishment and
safety by conducting a mock rescue experiment. We use a custom-made human-sized
dummy that has been sensorised to be used as the casualty. In terms of safety,
we observe several parameters during the experiment including impact force,
acceleration, speed and displacement of the dummy's head. We also compare the
performance of the proposed immersive stereoscopic teleperception to
conventional monocular teleperception. The results of the experiments show that
the observed safety parameters are below key safety thresholds which could
possibly lead to head or neck injuries. Moreover, the teleperception comparison
results demonstrate an improvement in task-accomplishment performance when the
operator is using the immersive teleperception.

fixed points of gravitational coupling, is frequently followed by two steps:
cutoff identification and improvement. Although there are various models for
identifying the cutoff momentum by some physical length, saving the general
covariance should be considered as an important property in the procedure. In
this paper, use of an arbitrary function of curvature invariants for cutoff
identification is suggested. It is shown that the field equations for this
approach differs from the ones obtained from the conventional cutoff
identification and improvement, even for nonvacuum solutions of the improved
Einstein equations. Indeed, it is concluded that these two steps are correlated
to each other.

$\phi_{0}$ strongly increases at high values of the exchange field near the
borderline with a half-metal, and it exists also in the half-metal regime.

traditional statistical and mathematical models as a third pillar for
ecological analysis. Broadly speaking, a simulation model is an algorithm,
typically implemented as a computer program, which propagates the states of a
system forward. Unlike in a mathematical model, however, this propagation does
not employ the methods of calculus but rather a set of rules or formulae that
directly prescribe the next state. Such an algorithmic model specification is
particularly suited for describing systems that are difficult to capture or
analyze with differential equations such as: (a) systems that are highly
nonlinear or chaotic; (b) discrete systems, for example networks or groups of
distinct individuals; (c) systems that are stochastic; and (d) systems that are
too complex to be successfully treated with classical calculus. As these
situations are frequently encountered in ecology, simulation models are now
widely applied across the discipline. They have been instrumental in developing
new insights into classical questions of species' coexistence, community
assembly, population dynamics, biogeography, and many more. The methods for
this relatively young field are still being actively developed, and practical
work with simulation models requires ecologists to learn new skills such as
coding, sensitivity analysis, calibration, validation, and forecasting
uncertainties. Moreover, scientific inquiry with complex systems has led to
subtle changes to the philosophical and epistemological views regarding
simplicity, reductionism, and the relationship between prediction and
understanding.

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been recently demonstrated. Compared
to inversion on the original model space, using the latent space of a trained
GAN can offer the following benefits: (1) the generated model proposals are
geostatistically consistent with the prescribed prior training image (TI), and
(2) the parameter space is reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the
original model space. Nevertheless, exploring the learned latent space by
state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may still require a
large computational effort. As an alternative, parameters in this latent space
could possibly be optimized with much less computationally expensive
gradient-based methods. We show that due to the typically highly nonlinear
relationship between the latent space and the associated output space of a GAN,
gradient-based deterministic inversion may fail even when considering a linear
forward physical model. We tested two deterministic inversion approaches: a
quasi-Newton gradient descent using the Adam algorithm and a Gauss-Newton (GN)
method that makes use of the Jacobian matrix calculated by finite-differencing.
For a channelized binary TI and a synthetic linear crosshole ground penetrating
radar (GPR) tomography problem involving 576 measurements with low noise, we
observe that when allowing for a total of 10,000 iterations only 13% of the
gradient descent trials locate a solution that has the required data misfit.
The tested GN inversion was unable to recover a solution with the appropriate
data misfit. Our results suggest that deterministic inversion performance
strongly depends on the inversion approach, starting model, true reference
model, number of iterations and noise realization. In contrast,
computationally-expensive probabilistic global optimization always finds an
appropriate solution.

upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) (Bhattacharyya {\em et al.},

resolvent, one of the main objectives in the present paper is a local spectral
analysis of $A_\alpha$ near the Landau levels $B(2q+1)$. Under various
conditions on $\alpha$ it is shown that the perturbation smears the Landau
levels into eigenvalue clusters, and the accumulation rate of the eigenvalues
within these clusters is determined in terms of the capacity of the support of
$\alpha$. Furthermore, the use of Landau Hamiltonians with
$\delta$-perturbations as model operators for more realistic quantum systems is
justified by showing that $A_\alpha$ can be approximated in the norm resolvent

begun mid-late 2011. We detect for the first time a signal at about 38 min that

  measurements",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major bottleneck in nanoparticle measurements is the lack of comparability.
Comparability of measurement results is obtained by metrological traceability,
which is obtained by calibration. In the present work the calibration of
dimensional nanoparticle measurements is performed through the construction of
a calibration curve by comparison of measured reference standards to their
certified value. Subsequently, a general approach is proposed to perform a
measurement uncertainty evaluation for a measured quantity when no
comprehensive physical model is available, by statistically modelling
appropriately selected measurement data. The experimental data is collected so
that the influence of relevant parameters can be assessed by fitting a mixed
model to the data. Furthermore, this model allows to generate a probability
density function (PDF) for the concerned measured quantity. Applying this
methodology to dimensional nanoparticle measurements leads to a PDF for a
measured dimensional quantity of the nanoparticles. A PDF for the measurand,
which is the certified counterpart of that measured dimensional quantity, can
then be extracted by reporting a PDF for the measured dimensional quantity on
the calibration curve. The PDF for the measurand grasps its total measurement
uncertainty. Working in a fully Bayesian framework is natural due to the
instrinsic caracter of the quantity of interest: the distribution of size
rather than the size of one single particle. The developed methodology is
applied to the particular case where dimensional nanoparticle measurements are
performed using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The reference standards used
to build a calibration curve are nano-gratings with step heights covering the
application range of the calibration curve.

action of the Coriolis and inertial terms of the Navier-Stokes equation. The
flow is driven by a body force and is subject to global rotation and uniform
sweeping velocity. The model can be studied down to arbitrarily low viscosity
and naturally leads to the strong-field scaling regime for the magnetic energy
produced above threshold: the magnetic energy is proportional to the global
rotation rate and independent of the viscosity. Depending on the relative
orientations of global rotation and large-scale sweeping, the dynamo
bifurcation is either supercritical or subcritical. In the supercritical case,
the magnetic energy follows the scaling-law for supercritical strong-field
dynamos predicted on dimensional grounds by Petrelis & Fauve (2001). In the
subcritical case, the system jumps to a finite-amplitude dynamo branch. The
magnetic energy obeys a magneto-geostrophic scaling-law (Roberts & Soward
1972), with a turbulent Elsasser number of the order of unity, where the
magnetic diffusivity of the standard Elsasser number appears to be replaced by
an eddy diffusivity. In the absence of global rotation, the dynamo bifurcation
is subcritical and the saturated magnetic energy obeys the equipartition
scaling regime. We consider both the vicinity of the dynamo threshold and the
limit of large distance from threshold to put these various scaling behaviors
on firm analytical ground.

the contributions to the absorption originating from both the interband

in terms of sequences of inter- and intraband excitations can be evaluated
separately which allows for a transparent analysis, the identification of the

the perturbative regime, we obtain analytical expressions for the multi-photon
absorption coefficients for continuous-wave excitation. These results are shown
to agree well with numerical results for short pulses and/or finite dephasing
and relaxation times and we confirm the previously predicted strong enhancement
of two-photon absorption for non-degenerate conditions for pulsed excitation.
We discuss the dependencies on the light frequencies, initial band populations,
and the time delay between the pulses. The frequency dependence of the
two-photon absorption coefficient for non-degenerate excitation is evaluated

mbar}$, minimal temperatures along the cavity axis in the mK regime are
observed. Simultaneously, the center-of-mass (COM) motion along the other two
spatial directions is cooled to minimal temperatures of a few hundred $\rm mK$.
Measuring temperatures and damping rates as the pressure is varied, we find
that the cooling efficiencies depend on the particle position within the
intracavity standing wave. This data and the behaviour of the COM temperatures
as functions of cavity detuning and tweezer power are consistent with a
theoretical analysis of the experiment. Experimental limits and opportunities
of our approach are outlined.

for stochastic differential equations. Risk awareness is in our framework
captured by objective functions in which the risk neutral expectation is
replaced by a risk function, a nonlinear functional of random variables that
account for the controller's risk preferences. We state and prove a risk aware
minimum principle that is a parsimonious generalization of the well-known risk
neutral, stochastic Pontryagin's minimum principle. As our main results we give
necessary and also sufficient conditions for optimality of control processes
taking values on probability measures defined on a given action space. We show
that remarkably, going from the risk neutral to the risk aware case, the
minimum principle is simply modified by the introduction of one additional
real-valued stochastic process that acts as a risk adjustment factor for given
cost rate and terminal cost functions. This adjustment process is explicitly
given as the expectation, conditional on the filtration at the given time, of
an appropriately defined functional derivative of the risk function evaluated
at the random total cost. For our results we rely on the Fr\'echet
differentiability of the risk function, and for completeness, we prove under
mild assumptions the existence of Fr\'echet derivatives of some common risk
functions. We give a simple application of the results for a portfolio
allocation problem and show that the risk awareness of the objective function
gives rise to a risk premium term that is characterized by the risk adjustment
process described above. This suggests uses of our results in e.g. pricing of
risk modeled by generic risk functions in financial applications.

films have revitalized the interest in using ferroelectrics for nanoscale
device applications. To take advantage of this silicon-compatible
ferroelectric, fundamental questions such as the origin of ferroelectricity and
better approach to controlled realization of ferroelectricity at the nanoscale
need to be addressed. The emergence of robust polarization in HfO$_2$-based
thin films is considered as the cumulative effect of various extrinsic factors
such as finite-size effects and surface/interface effects of small grains,
compressive stress, dopants, oxygen vacancies, and electric fields. The kinetic
effects of phase transitions and their potential impacts on the emergence of
ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ at the nanoscale are not well understood. In this
work, we construct the transition paths between different polymorphs of hafnia
with density functional theory calculations and variable-cell nudged elastic
band technique. We find that the transition barriers depend strongly on the
mechanical boundary conditions and the transition from the tetragonal phase to
the polar orthorhombic phase is a fast process kinetically under clamping. The
effects of growth orientations and epitaxial strains on the relative stability
of different phases of HfO$_2$ are investigated. The two orthorhombic phases,
polar $Pca2_1$ and non-polar $Pbca$, become thermodynamically stable in
(111)-oriented thin films over a wide range of epitaxial strain conditions.
This work suggests a potential avenue to better stabilize the ferroelectric
phase in HfO$_2$ thin films through substrate orientation engineering.

functions used in lattice calculations of the nucleon axial form factors are
studied in chiral perturbation theory. For small quark masses this contribution
is expected to be the dominant excited-state contamination at large time
separations. To leading order in chiral perturbation theory the results depend
on only two experimentally known low-energy constants and the
nucleon-pion-state contribution to the form factors can be estimated. The
nucleon-pion-state contribution to the axial form factor $G_{\rm A}(Q^2)$ is at
the 5 percent level for a source-sink separation of 2 fm and shows almost no
dependence on the momentum transfer $Q^2$. In contrast, for the induced
pseudoscalar form factor $\tilde{G}_{\rm P}(Q^2)$ the nucleon-pion-state
contribution shows a rather strong dependence on $Q^2$ and leads to a 10 to 40
percent underestimation of $\tilde{G}_{\rm P}(Q^2)$ at small momentum
transfers. The ChPT results can be used to analytically remove the
nucleon-pion-state contribution from lattice data. Performing this removal for

previous versions, we have incorporated new results and examples, changed some

had 550 pages, this one 630.As the third version, it is composed of six parts:
Part I is still a toolbox with key results which are used in all the other
parts. The study of the simplest case, i.e. the case of a co-dimension 1
discontinuity, is now split in two parts: in Part II, we only consider control
problems and the associated Bellman Equations are treated by using only the
classical notion of viscosity solutions. In this part, the methods are a
combinations of control and pdes techniques. On the contrary, Part III
describes purely pdes approaches which are inspired by the literature on
Hamilton Jacobi Equations on networks and which can handle the case of
non-convex Hamiltonians. In this part, we present two notions of solutions,
namely flux-limited and junction viscosity solutions, and we study in detail
their properties by providing comparison and stability results. We also show
that they are ``almost'' equivalent when both make sense, i.e. for quasi-convex
Hamiltonians. Part IV concerns stratified problems in $\R^N$, i.e. problems
with discontinuities of any co-dimensions: the main change compared to the
previous version is the introduction of a notion of ``weak'' stratified
(sub)solution. In Part V, we address the case of stratified problems in bounded
or unbounded domains with state-constraints, allowing very surprising
applications as well as singular boundary conditions. Finally, in Part VI we
describe some applications to KPP (Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov) type problems
and we discuss possible extensions to problems with jumps and to ``stratified
networks''.Even if we consider this version as being the final one, all

developed slowly in response to the practical challenges faced by data
practitioners based at national statistical institutes (NSIs). SDC's subsequent
emergence as a specialised academic field was an outcome of three interrelated
socio-technical changes: (i) the advent of accessible computing as a research
tool in the 1980s meant that it became possible - and then increasingly easy -
for researchers to process larger quantities of data automatically; this
naturally increased demand for such data; (ii) it became possible for data
holders to process and disseminate detailed data as digital files and (iii) the
number of organisations holding data about individuals proliferated. This also
meant the number of potential adversaries with the resources to attack any
given dataset increased exponentially. In this article, we describe the state
of the art for SDC and then discuss the core issues and future challenges. In
particular, we touch on SDC and big data, on SDC and machine learning, and on
SDC and anti-discrimination.

this corresponds to a small loop visible in the SDO/AIA Fe XVIII emission,
which matches a similar structure lower in the solar atmosphere seen by IRIS in
SJI1330{\AA} and 1400\AA. The NuSTAR emission in both 2.5-4 keV and 4-6 keV, is
located in a small source at this loop location. The IRIS slit was over the
microflaring loop, and fits show little change in Mg II but do show intensity
increases, slight width enhancements and redshifts in Si IV andO IV, indicating
that this microflare had most significance in and above the upper chromosphere.
The NuSTAR microflare spectrum is well fitted by a thermal component of 5.8MK

$10^{26}$ erg, making it considerably smaller than previously studied X-ray

evaluate the performance of an M/M/1 system in various settings that consider
exact expressions and bounds. Our results indicate that the performance of CoUD
differs depending on the cost assigned per time unit, however the optimal
policy remains the same for linear ageing and varies for non-linear ageing.
When it comes to the VoIU the performance difference appears only when the cost
increases non-linearly with time. The study illustrates the importance of the
newly introduced variants of age, furthermore supported in the case of VoIU by
its tractability.

widely used in many applications such as social network analytics and
suspicious transaction detections from financial networks. On the other hand,
the computation complexity of many graph pattern matching algorithms is
expensive, and it is not affordable to extract patterns from million-scale
graphs. Moreover, most real-world networks are time-evolving, updating their
structures continuously, which makes it harder to update and output newly
matched patterns in real time. Many incremental graph pattern matching
algorithms which reduce the number of updates have been proposed to handle such
dynamic graphs. However, it is still challenging to recompute vertices in the
incremental graph pattern matching algorithms in a single process, and that
prevents the real-time analysis. We propose an incremental graph pattern
matching algorithm to deal with time-evolving graph data and also propose an
adaptive optimization system based on reinforcement learning to recompute
vertices in the incremental process more efficiently. Then we discuss the
qualitative efficiency of our system with several types of data graphs and
pattern graphs. We evaluate the performance using million-scale attributed and
time-evolving social graphs. Our incremental algorithm is up to 10.1 times
faster than an existing graph pattern matching and 1.95 times faster with the
adaptive systems in a computation node than naive incremental processing.

growth of wealth, under a known probability distribution. Breiman provides
rigorous mathematical proofs that Kelly strategy maximizes the rate of asset
growth (asymptotically maximal magnitude property), which is thought of as the
principal justification for selecting expected logarithmic utility as the guide
to portfolio selection. Despite very nice theoretical properties, the classic
Kelly strategy is rarely used in practical portfolio allocation directly due to
practically unavoidable uncertainty. In this paper we consider the
distributional robust version of the Kelly gambling problem, in which the
probability distribution is not known, but lies in a given set of possible
distributions. The bet is chosen to maximize the worst-case (smallest) expected
log growth among the distributions in the given set.
  Computationally, this distributional robust Kelly gambling problem is convex,
but in general need not be tractable. We show that it can be tractably solved
in a number of useful cases when there is a finite number of outcomes with
standard tools from disciplined convex programming.
  Theoretically, in sequential decision making with varying distribution within
a given uncertainty set, we prove that distributional robust Kelly strategy
asymptotically maximizes the worst-case rate of asset growth, and dominants any
other essentially different strategy by magnitude. Our results extends
Breiman's theoretical result and justifies that the distributional robust Kelly
strategy is the optimal strategy in the long-run for practical betting with

motions within a granular assembly can produce bewildering sequences of
movements at the contacts between particle pairs. With frictional contacts, the
relationship between contact movement and force is non-linear and
path-dependent, requiring an efficient means of computing the forces and
storing their histories. By cleverly applying the principles of Cattaneo,
Mindlin, and Deresiewicz, Jurgen Jager developed an efficient approach for
computing the full three-dimensional force between identical elastic spheres
that have undergone difficult movement sequences (J. Jager, New Solutions in
Contact Mechanics. WIT Press: Southampton, U.K.). This paper presents a
complete Jager algorithm that can be incorporated into DEM codes and also
describes three special provisions for DEM simulations: (1) a method for
handling particle pairs that undergo complex tumbling and twirling motions in
three-dimensions; (2) a compact data structure for storing the loading history
of the many contacts in a large assembly; and (3) an approximation of the Jager
algorithm that reduces memory demand. The algorithm addresses contact
translations between elastic spheres having identical properties, but it does
not resolve the tractions produced by twisting or rolling motions. A
performance test demonstrates that the algorithm can be applied in a DEM code
with modest increases in computation time but with more substantial increases
in required storage.

quantifying the severities of such irregular shearing records, allowing the 24

with two mechanisms. The first mechanism, already widely addressed in the DEM
literature, involves a contact moment between the particles. The second
mechanism involves a reduction of the tangential contact force, but without a
contact moment. This type of rotational resistance, termed creep-friction, is
the subject of the paper. Within the creep-friction literature, the term
""creep"" does not mean a viscous mechanism, but rather connotes a slight slip
that accompanies rolling. Two extremes of particle motions bound the range of
creep-friction behaviors: a pure tangential translation is modeled as a
Cattaneo-Mindlin interaction, whereas prolonged steady-state rolling
corresponds to the traditional wheel-rail problem described by Carter,
Poritsky, and others. DEM simulations, however, are dominated by the transient
creep-friction rolling conditions that lie between these two extremes. A
simplified model is proposed for the three-dimensional transient creep-friction
rolling of two spheres. The model is an extension of the work of Dahlberg and
Alfredsson, who studied the two-dimensional interactions of disks. The proposed
model is applied to two different systems: a pair of spheres and a large dense
assembly of spheres. Although creep-friction can reduce the tangential contact
force that would otherwise be predicted with Cattaneo-Mindlin theory, a
significant force reduction occurs only when the rate of rolling is much
greater than the rate of translational sliding and only after a sustained
period of rolling. When applied to the deviatoric loading of an assembly of
spheres, the proposed creep-friction model has minimal effect on macroscopic
strength or stiffness. At the micro-scale of individual contacts,
creep-friction does have a modest influence on the incremental contact
behavior.

particularly in astronomy, has revealed the limitation of working with simple
single-task scenarios in which any task in need of a predictive model is looked
in isolation, and ignores the existence of other similar tasks. In contrast, a
new generation of techniques is emerging where predictive models can take
advantage of previous experience to leverage information from similar tasks.
The new emerging area is referred to as transfer learning. In this paper, I
briefly describe the motivation behind the use of transfer learning techniques,
and explain how such techniques can be used to solve popular problems in
astronomy. As an example, a prevalent problem in astronomy is to estimate the
class of an object (e.g., Supernova Ia) using a generation of photometric
light-curve datasets where data abounds, but class labels are scarce; such
analysis can benefit from spectroscopic data where class labels are known with
high confidence, but the data sample is small. Transfer learning provides a
robust and practical solution to leverage information from one domain to
improve the accuracy of a model built on a different domain. In the example
above, transfer learning would look to overcome the difficulty in the
compatibility of models between spectroscopic data and photometric data, since
data properties such as size, class priors, and underlying distributions, are
all expected to be significantly different.

measurement and mental stress monitoring. A smartphone camera-based
PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and a low-cost thermal camera can be used to create
cheap, convenient and mobile monitoring systems. However, to ensure reliable
monitoring results, a person has to remain still for several minutes while a
measurement is being taken. This is very cumbersome and makes its use in
real-life mobile situations quite impractical.
  Objective: We propose a system which combines PPG and thermography with the
aim of improving cardiovascular signal quality and capturing stress responses
quickly.
  Methods: Using a smartphone camera with a low cost thermal camera added on,
we built a novel system which continuously and reliably measures two different
types of cardiovascular events: i) blood volume pulse and ii)
vasoconstriction/dilation-induced temperature changes of the nose tip. 17
healthy participants, involved in a series of stress-inducing mental workload
tasks, measured their physiological responses to stressors over a short window
of time (20 seconds) immediately after each task. Participants reported their
level of perceived mental stress using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). We
used normalized K-means clustering to reduce interpersonal differences in the
self-reported ratings. For the instant stress inference task, we built novel
low-level feature sets representing variability of cardiovascular patterns. We
then used the automatic feature learning capability of artificial Neural
Networks (NN) to improve the mapping between the extracted set of features and
the self-reported ratings. We compared our proposed method with existing
hand-engineered features-based machine learning methods.
  Results, Conclusions: ... due to limited space here, we refer to our
manuscript.

probabilities represented by monomial functions. Such monomial structure has
proven very useful when studying robustness under the assumption of a
multilinear model where all monomial have either zero or one exponents.
Robustness in probabilistic graphical models is usually investigated by varying
some of the input probabilities and observing the effects of these on output
probabilities of interest. Here the assumption of multilinearity is relaxed and
a general approach for sensitivity analysis in non-multilinear models is
presented. It is shown that in non-multilinear models sensitivity functions
have a polynomial form, conversely to multilinear models where these are simply
linear. The form of various divergences and distances under different
covariation schemes is also formally derived. Proportional covariation is
proven to be optimal in non-multilinear models under some specific choices of
varied parameters. The methodology is illustrated throughout by an educational
application.

direction in the transportation domain. These methods can potentially help to
improve our understanding of the dynamic flows of vehicles, people, and goods.
Understanding these dynamics has economic and social consequences, which can
improve the quality of life locally or worldwide. Aiming at this objective, a
significant amount of research has focused on clustering moving objects to
address problems in many domains, including the transportation, health, and
environment. However, previous research has not investigated the lifecycle of a
cluster, including cluster genesis, existence, and disappearance. The
representation and analysis of cluster lifecycles can create novel avenues for
research, result in new insights for analyses, and allow unique forms of
prediction. This technical report focuses on studying the lifecycle of clusters
by investigating the relations that a cluster has with moving elements and
other clusters. This technical report also proposes a big data framework that
manages the identification and processing of a cluster lifecycle. The ongoing
research approach will lead to new ways to perform cluster analysis and advance
the state of the art by leading to new insights related to cluster lifecycle.
These results can have a significant impact on transport industry data science
applications in a wide variety of areas, including congestion management,
resource optimization, and hotspot management.

signal (e.g., heart rate) before, during, and after excitations taking the
system out of its equilibrium (e.g., physical effort during cardiac stress
testing). Dynamical modeling can be applied to a broad range of outcomes such
as physiological processes in medicine and psychosocial processes in social
sciences, and it allows to extract simple characteristics of the signal
studied. The model we propose is based on a first order linear differential
equation defined by three main parameters corresponding to the initial
equilibrium value, the dynamic characteristic time, and the reaction to the
excitation. In this paper, several estimation procedures for this model are
considered and tested in a simulation study, that clarifies under which
conditions accurate estimates are provided. Finally, applications of this model
are illustrated using cardiology data recorded during effort tests.

dimensions of the load forecasting studies to decide which forecasting tools to
use in which case. This classification aims to provide a synthetic view of the
relevant forecasting techniques and methodologies by forecasting problem. In
addition, the key principles of the main techniques and methodologies used are
summarized along with the reviews of these papers.
  The classification process relies on two couples of parameters that define a
forecasting problem. Each article is classified with key information about the
dataset used and the forecasting tools implemented: the forecasting techniques
(probabilistic or deterministic) and methodologies, the data cleansing
techniques, and the error metrics.
  The process to select the articles reviewed in this paper was conducted into
two steps. First, a set of load forecasting studies was built based on relevant
load forecasting reviews and forecasting competitions. The second step
consisted in selecting the most relevant studies of this set based on the
following criteria: the quality of the description of the forecasting
techniques and methodologies implemented, the description of the results, and
the contributions.
  This paper can be read in two passes. The first one by identifying the
forecasting problem of interest to select the corresponding class into one of
the four classification tables. Each one references all the articles classified
across a forecasting horizon. They provide a synthetic view of the forecasting
tools used by articles addressing similar forecasting problems. Then, a second
level composed of four Tables summarizes key information about the forecasting
tools and the results of these studies. The second pass consists in reading the
key principles of the main techniques and methodologies of interest and the
reviews of the articles.

(FLD) is proposed to rank the influential nodes in complex networks, where a
node with high fuzzy local dimension has high influential ability. This
proposed method focuses on the influence of the distance from the center node
on the local dimension of center node by fuzzy set, resulting in a change in
influential ability. In order to show this proposed method's effectiveness and
accuracy, four real-world networks are applied in this paper. Meanwhile,
Susceptible-Infected (SI) is used to simulate the spreading process by FLD and
other centrality measures, and Kendall's tau coefficient is used to describe
the correlation between the influential nodes obtained by centrality and the
results measured by SI model. Observing from the ranking lists and simulated
results, this method is effective and accurate to rank the influential nodes.

flight. The concept of satellite smart adapter is proposed in this study to
achieve active vibration control of launch vehicle on satellite. The satellite
smart adapter has 18 active struts in which the middle section of each strut is
made of piezoelectric stack actuator. Comprehensive conceptual design of the
satellite smart adapter is presented to indicate the design parameters,
requirements and philosophy applied which are based on the reliability and
durability criterions to ensure successful functionality of the proposed
system, also fabrication process of the proposed piezoelectric stack actuator
is discussed in detail. The coupled electromechanical virtual work equation for
the piezoelectric stack actuator in each active strut is derived by applying
D'Alembert's principle to calculate the consistent mass matrix, the stiffness
matrix and the load vector using finite element approximation. Modal analysis
is performed to characterize the inherent properties of the smart adapter and
extraction of a mathematical model of the system. Active vibration control
analysis was conducted using fuzzy logic control with triangular membership
functions and acceleration feedback. The control results conclude that the
proposed satellite smart adapter configuration which benefits from
piezoelectric stack actuator as elements of its 18 active struts has high
strength and shows excellent robustness and effectiveness in vibration
suppression of launch vehicle on satellite.

""Combined 3D thinning and greedy algorithm to approximate realistic particles

author [58]. The main changes here are (1) a recently developed DEM code
Rigid3D is used for the DEM simulations, instead of the open-source software
LIGGGHTS in the original work; (2) three new validation tests were carried out.
  The main idea of this work is to combine the 3D thinning and greedy
set-covering algorithms for the approximation of realistic particles with
multiple spheres. First, the particle's medial surface (or surface skeleton),
from which all candidate (maximal inscribed) spheres can be generated, is
computed by the topological 3D thinning algorithm. Then, the clump generation
procedure is converted into a greedy set-covering problem. The advantage of
this approach over previous studies is that, with a given particle media
surface and a grid resolution for the discretized particle, a minimum number of
component (or primary) spheres for a MS particle is guaranteed for a maximum
volume coverage, thanks to the combined algorithm. To correct the mass
distribution of a MS particle due to the highly overlapped component spheres,
linear programming (LP) is used to adjust the density of each component sphere,
such that the aggregate properties such as mass, center of mass, and inertia
tensor are identical or close enough to the prototypical particle. We then
demonstrate the capability of the combined algorithm to approximate simple to
complex particle shapes in three test cases: (1) particle-wall contact; (2)
particle settling; and (3) granular flow in a rotating drum.
