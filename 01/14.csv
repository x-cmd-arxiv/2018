estimation. It is a challenging problem due to its ill-posedness nature and has
found wide application in industry. Previous efforts belongs roughly to two
families: learning-based method and interactive method. Learning-based method,
in which deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely used, can achieve
good result. But they suffer low generalization ability and typically perform
poorly for unfamiliar scenes. Besides, data-hungry nature for such method makes
data aquisition expensive and time-consuming. Interactive method requires human
annotation of depth which, however, is errorneous and of large variance.
  To overcome these problems, we propose a new perspective for single monocular
image depth estimation problem: size to depth. Our method require sparse label
for real-world size of object rather than raw depth. A Coarse depth map is then
inferred following geometric relationships according to size labels. Then we
refine the depth map by doing energy function optimization on conditional
random field(CRF). We experimentally demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional depth-labeling methods and can produce satisfactory depth maps.

based on radio signals and the association of specular multipath components
(MPCs) with geometric features. Especially in indoor scenarios, robust
localization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath
propagation, unknown MPC-feature association, and limited visibility of
features. In our approach, specular reflections at flat surfaces are described
in terms of virtual anchors (VAs) that are mirror images of the physical
anchors (PAs). The positions of these VAs and possibly also of the PAs are
unknown. We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem and represent it by a
factor graph, which enables the use of belief propagation (BP) for efficient
marginalization of the joint posterior distribution. The resulting BP-based
SLAM algorithm detects the VAs associated with the PAs and estimates jointly
the time-varying position of the mobile agent and the positions of the VAs and
possibly also of the PAs, thereby leveraging the MPCs in the radio signal for
improved accuracy and robustness of agent localization. The algorithm has a low
computational complexity and scales well in all relevant system parameters.
Experimental results using both synthetic measurements and real ultra-wideband
radio signals demonstrate the excellent performance of the algorithm in
challenging indoor environments.

produced a catalog of 92 polarized radio sources at 150 MHz at 4.3 arcminute
resolution and 1 mJy rms sensitivity, which is the largest catalog of polarized
sources at such low frequencies. We estimate a lower limit to the polarized
source surface density at 150 MHz, with our resolution and sensitivity, of 1
source per 6.2 square degrees. We find that our Faraday depth measurements are
in agreement with previous measurements and have significantly smaller errors.
Most of our sources show significant depolarization compared to 1.4 GHz, but
there is a small population of sources with low depolarization indicating that
their polarized emission is highly localized in Faraday depth. We predict that
an extension of this work to the full LOTSS data would detect at least 3400
polarized sources using the same methods, and probably considerably more with
improved data processing.

that only the intended receiver has access to the non-observable channels

their journeys to join the Semantic Web mainstream. This paper uses ""LOD KOS""
as an umbrella term to refer to all of the value vocabularies and lightweight
ontologies within the Semantic Web framework. The paper provides an overview of
what the LOD KOS movement has brought to various communities and users. These
are not limited to the colonies of the value vocabulary constructors and
providers, nor the catalogers and indexers who have a long history of applying
the vocabularies to their products. The LOD dataset producers and LOD service
providers, the information architects and interface designers, and researchers
in sciences and humanities, are also direct beneficiaries of LOD KOS. The paper
examines a set of the collected cases (experimental or in real applications)
and aims to find the usages of LOD KOS in order to share the practices and
ideas among communities and users. Through the viewpoints of a number of
different user groups, the functions of LOD KOS are examined from multiple
dimensions. This paper focuses on the LOD dataset producers, vocabulary
producers, and researchers (as end-users of KOS).

miniaturized and tunable antennas in the terahertz band. These unique
advantages open the door to new reconfigurable antenna structures which, in
turn, enable novel communication protocols at different levels of the stack.
This paper explores both aspects by, first, presenting a terahertz
Yagi-Uda-like antenna concept that achieves reconfiguration both in frequency
and beam direction simultaneously. Then, a programmable antenna controller
design is proposed to expose the reconfigurability to the PHY and MAC layers,
and several examples of its applicability are given. The performance and cost
of the proposed scheme is evaluated through full-wave simulations and

compatibility to the corresponding linearly elastic local solution. By posing
the quadrature rule as an equality constrained least squares problem, we obtain

tracking ability internal to a communication device such as a modem, where
impairments in tracking will cause interference between eigenmodes. The model
can also facilitate mode tracking testing as it directly produces tracked
ungtangled eigenmodes, providing the narrowest possible singular vector Doppler

simulations of the flow are performed. The kinetic energy $E$ of the turbulent
flow and the order parameter $M$, a measure of the spatially organised
modulation of turbulence, are sampled and processed in view analytical results
from the phenomenology of phase transitions. The first crossover concerns the
loss of spatial organisation of turbulence in the flow. In the band phase, the
order parameter $M$ decreases continuously with the Reynolds number $R$ toward
a small value, while its response function $\chi_M$ displays a maximum at the
crossover. In the uniform phase, the order parameter $M$ and its variance
$\sigma$ decrease toward zero following mean field field scalings $M,\sigma
\propto 1/\sqrt{L_xL_z(R-R_c)}$ as $R$ is increased. The kinetic energy $E$ is
an affine function of $R$ except in a small range where a sharp increase is
detected, which corresponds to the second crossover. In this range, spatial and
temporal coexistence of the uniform turbulence phase and laminar-turbulent
bands phase is observed. This sharp increase is concomitant with a maximum of
the response function of the kinetic energy. The finite size analysis reveals
that the jump does not steepen and that the maximum of response function of $E$
saturates as size is increased. The first crossover is formally identical to a
critical phenomenon in condensed matter. The second crossover is in agreement
with a first order phase transition smeared by finite noise. The analytical
analysis of this phenomenon assuming a non interacting gas of fronts between
domain of the two phases provides a scaling of the response function consistent
with that of $E$.

microalgae cell, their radiative properties will vary with growth time due to
accumulation of pigment and lipid, cell division and metabolism. In this work,
we report both experimental and theoretical evidence of temporal scaling
behavior of the growth dependent radiative properties of microalgae cell
suspensions. A new concept, the temporal scaling function (TSF), defined as the
ratio of absorption or scattering cross-sections at growth phase to that at
stationary phase, is introduced to characterize the temporal scaling. The
temporal evolution and temporal scaling characteristics of the absoroption and
scattering cross-sections of three example microalgae species, Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and Chlorella protothecoides, were
experimentally studied at spectral range 380 to 850 nm. It is shown that the
TSFs of the absorption and scattering cross-sections for different microalgae
species are approximately constant at different wavelength, which confirms
theoretical predictions very well. With the aid of the temporal scaling
relation, the radiative properties of microalgae at any growth time can be
calculated based on those measured at stationary phase. The findings of this
work will help the understanding of time dependent radiative properties of
microalgae and facilitate their applications in light field analysis in PBRs

wave searches from compact binaries of neutron stars or black holes.
Improvements in low-frequency response and bandwidth due to detector hardware
upgrades pose a data analysis challenge in the advanced LIGO era as they result
in increased redundancy in template databases and longer templates due to the
higher number of signal cycles in-band. The RP-based methods presented here
address both these issues within the same broad framework. We first use RP for
an efficient, singular value decomposition inspired template matrix
factorization and develop a geometric intuition for why this approach works. We
then use RP to calculate approximate time-domain match correlations in a lower
dimensional vector space. For searches over parameters corresponding to
non-spinning binaries with a neutron star and a black hole, a combination of
the two methods can reduce the total on-line computational cost by an order of
magnitude over a nominal baseline. This can, in turn, help free-up
computational resources needed to go beyond current spin-aligned searches to
more complex ones involving generically spinning waveforms.

synthesis is modular as it only requires approximate information about the line
parameters that couple neighbouring units. The performance of the proposed

consists of 6 DC-DC boost converters configured in a radial and meshed

some important classes of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved

connectivity similar to motifs observed in the superficial layers of neocortex.
The winner-take-all modules are sparsely coupled by programming neurons that
embed the constraints onto the otherwise homogeneous modular computational
substrate. We show rules that embed any instance of the CSPs planar four-color
graph coloring, maximum independent set, and Sudoku on this substrate, and
provide mathematical proofs that guarantee these graph coloring problems will
convergence to a solution. The network is composed of non-saturating linear
threshold neurons. Their lack of right saturation allows the overall network to
explore the problem space driven through the unstable dynamics generated by
recurrent excitation. The direction of exploration is steered by the constraint
neurons. While many problems can be solved using only linear inhibitory
constraints, network performance on hard problems benefits significantly when
these negative constraints are implemented by non-linear multiplicative
inhibition. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of instability

perfect transparency and light amplification in monolayer graphene structures.
Current-induced complete suppression of the graphene absorption is

wide-angle engineered reflection. These recently proposed planar structures can
reflect an incident plane wave into a prescribed (generally non-specular) angle
with very high efficiencies, using only a single meta-atom per period. Such
devices offer a means to overcome the implementation difficulties associated
with standard metasurfaces (consisting of closely-packed subwavelength
meta-atoms) and the relatively low efficiencies of gradient metasurfaces. In
contrast to previous work, in which accurate systematic design was limited to
metagratings unrealistically suspended in free space, we derive herein a
closed-form formalism allowing realization of printed-circuit-board (PCB)
metagrating perfect reflectors, comprised of loaded conducting strips defined
on standard metal-backed dielectric substrate. The derivation yields a detailed
procedure for the determination of the substrate thickness and conductor
geometry required to achieve unitary coupling efficiencies, without requiring
even a single full-wave simulation. Our methodology, verified via commercial
solvers, ultimately allows one to proceed from a theoretical design to
synthesis of a full physical structure, avoiding the time-consuming numerical

shows a clear anti-correlation. It is proposed that this is tracing the CO snow
line in the envelopes: N2H+ emission is depleted toward the center of these
sources in contrast to the CO isotopologue emission which exhibits a peak. The
positions of the CO snow lines traced by the N2H+ emission are located at much
larger radii than those calculated using the current luminosities of the
central sources. This implies that these five sources have experienced a recent
accretion burst because the CO snow line would have been pushed outwards during
the burst due to the increased luminosity of the central star. The N2H+ and CO
isotopologue emission from DCE161, one of the other three sources, is most
likely tracing a transition disk at a later evolutionary stage. Excluding
DCE161, five out of seven sources (i.e., ~70%) show signatures of a recent

the gradient-descent optimization method. For a function in dimension d, the
gradient requires to compute at each step d partial derivatives. This method is
for instance used in machine-learning, to fit the models parameters so as to
minimize the error rate on a given data set, or in theoretical chemistry, to
obtain molecular conformation. Since each step requires to obtain d partial
derivatives, it can quickly become time-consuming when d grows and when each
computation of the function is complex. If the computation time of the function
to be optimized is the limiting factor, the convergence process can be
optimized using persistent random walks. For all the gradient-related method,
we here propose a way to minimize the optimization process by using random
walks instead of gradient computing. Optimization works on the dimensional
aspect of the function and not on the set size: this approach can thus be
combined with algorithm improvement based on the set size such as stochastic
gradient descent. As shown in a previous publication, the random walk can be
further optimized with persistence. We here detail the method principle, show
an estimate of the acceleration factor and check numerically that this
estimation is valid for quadratic functions.

pioneer of medical statistics, noticed that after the massive death spike there
was a dip in birth numbers around 9 months later which was significantly larger
than that which could be explained by the population change as a result of
excess deaths. In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a
birth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation,
Bertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not
revisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several
new cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases
to get a better understanding of this death-birth coupling phenomenon. The
largest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in
1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the
Twin Tower attack on September 11, 2001. We shall see that the first of these
events indeed produced an extra dip in births whereas the 9/11 event did not.
This disparity highlights the pivotal role of collateral sufferers. In the last
section it is shown how the present coupling leads to predictions; it can
explain in a unified way effects which so far have been studied separately, as
for instance the impact on birth rates of heat waves. Thus, it appears that
behind the random appearance of birth rate fluctuations there are in fact
hidden explanatory factors.

different on-off signatures which allow them listen to the transmissions of
neighbouring nodes during their off slots, leading to a compressed sensing
problem at each node with a collapsed codebook determined by a given node's

Delsarte-Goethals frames based upon Reed Muller codes, whilst at the same time

OSI stack for compatibility and efficiency. Although this has enabled the
success of radio communications, it has also introduced lengthy standardization
processes and imposed static allocation of the radio spectrum. Various
initiatives have been undertaken by the research community to tackle the
problem of artificial spectrum scarcity by both making frequency allocation
more dynamic and building flexible radios to replace the static ones. There is
reason to believe that just as computer vision and control have been overhauled
by the introduction of machine learning, wireless communication can also be
improved by utilizing similar techniques to increase the flexibility of
wireless networks. In this work, we pose the problem of discovering low-level
wireless communication schemes ex-nihilo between two agents in a fully
decentralized fashion as a reinforcement learning problem. Our proposed
approach uses policy gradients to learn an optimal bi-directional communication
scheme and shows surprisingly sophisticated and intelligent learning behavior.
We present the results of extensive experiments and an analysis of the fidelity

classification of conical special geometries with closed Reeb orbits (CSG).
Under mild assumptions, one shows that the underlying complex space of a CSG is
(birational to) an affine cone over a simply-connected $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial
log-Fano variety with Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}=\delta_{p,q}$. With some plausible
restrictions, this means that the Coulomb branch chiral ring $\mathscr{R}$ is a
graded polynomial ring generated by global holomorphic functions $u_i$ of
dimension $\Delta_i$. The coarse-grained classification of the CSG consists in
listing the (finitely many) dimension $k$-tuples
$\{\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\cdots,\Delta_k\}$ which are realized as Coulomb branch
dimensions of some rank-$k$ CSG: this is the problem we address in this paper.
Our sheaf-theoretical analysis leads to an Universal Dimension Formula for the
possible $\{\Delta_1,\cdots,\Delta_k\}$'s. For Lagrangian SCFTs the Universal
Formula reduces to the fundamental theorem of Springer Theory.
  The number $\boldsymbol{N}(k)$ of dimensions allowed in rank $k$ is given by
a certain sum of the Erd\""os-Bateman Number-Theoretic function (sequence
A070243 in OEIS) so that for large $k$ $$
\boldsymbol{N}(k)=\frac{2\,\zeta(2)\,\zeta(3)}{\zeta(6)}\,k^2+o(k^2). $$ In the
special case $k=2$ our dimension formula reproduces a recent result by Argyres
et al.
  Class Field Theory implies a subtlety: certain dimension $k$-tuples
$\{\Delta_1,\cdots,\Delta_k\}$ are consistent only if supplemented by
additional selection rules on the electro-magnetic charges, that is, for a SCFT
with these Coulomb dimensions not all charges/fluxes consistent with Dirac
quantization are permitted.
  We illustrate the various aspects with several examples and perform a number
of explicit checks. We include tables of dimensions for the first few $k$'s.

communication network (WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access
point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically. The UAV employs the
radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the
downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent
information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed
APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory
design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize
the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common
(minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period,
subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality
constraints. The resulted problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved
optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without
the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the
relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively
hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as
above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, we consider the
general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above
multi-location-hovering solution, we first propose an efficient successive
hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly with the downlink and uplink wireless
resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution by applying
the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming
(SCP). Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves
significant throughput gains over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP.

PM-Basis, which will be our second fundamental engine after polynomial matrix
multiplication: most other fast approximant basis algorithms basically aim at
efficiently reducing the input instance to instances for which PM-Basis is
fast. Such reductions usually involve partial linearization techniques due to
Storjohann, which have the effect of balancing the degrees and dimensions in
the manipulated matrices.
  Following these ideas, Zhou and Labahn gave two algorithms which are faster
than PM-Basis for important cases including Hermite-Pade approximation, yet
only for shifts whose values are concentrated around the minimum or the maximum
value. The three mentioned algorithms were designed for balanced orders and
compute approximant bases that are generally not normalized. Here, we show how
they can be modified to return the shifted Popov basis without impact on their
cost bound; besides, we extend Zhou and Labahn's algorithms to arbitrary
orders.
  Furthermore, we give an algorithm which handles arbitrary shifts with one
extra logarithmic factor in the cost bound compared to the above algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, this improves upon previously known algorithms for
arbitrary shifts, including for particular cases such as Hermite-Pade
approximation. This algorithm is based on a recent divide and conquer approach
which reduces the general case to the case where information on the output
degree is available. As outlined above, we solve the latter case via partial
linearizations and PM-Basis.

ambiguous role of multi-user interference. In short, the beneficial effect of
multi-user interference on RF energy harvesting is obtained at the price of a
reduced link capacity, thus originating nontrivial trade-offs between the
achievable information rate and the harvestable energy. Arguably, in indoor
environments, this trade-off might be affected by the propagation loss due to
blockage objects like walls. Hence, a couple of fundamental questions arise.
How much must the network elements be densified to counteract the blockage
attenuation? Is blockage always detrimental on the achievable rate-energy
trade-off? In this paper, we analyse the performance of an indoor
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT-enabled network in the attempt to
shed a light of those questions. The effects of the obstacles are examined with
the help of a stochastic approach in which energy transmitters (also referred
to as power heads) are located by using a Poisson Point Process and walls are
generated through a Manhattan Poisson Line Process. The stochastic behaviour of
the signal attenuation and the multi-user interference is studied to obtain the
Joint Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (J-CCDF) of information
rate and harvested power. Theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo
simulations. Eventually, the rate-energy trade-off is presented as a function
of the frequency of walls to emphasise the cross-dependences between the
deployment of the network elements and the topology of the venue.

of $\cal G$ randomly by so-called Boltzmann generators in order to translate
enumerative problems to the analysis of iid random variables. By that we are
able to exploit local limit theorems and large deviation results well-known
from probability theory to prove our claims. The main results are formulated
for generic combinatorial classes satisfying the SET-construction.

  This paper presents Shai, the first system that systematically enforces

idea is to push as many policy checks as possible to an offline, ahead-of-time
analysis phase, often relying on predicted values of runtime parameters such as
the state of access control lists or connected users' attributes. Runtime
interception is used sparingly, only to verify these predictions and to make
any remaining policy checks. Our prototype implementation relies on efficient,

`beyond halo mass' effects for galaxy evolution, we compare our results with
corresponding 2pcf measurements in mock catalogs constructed using a halo
occupation distribution that only uses halo mass as an input. We find that this
prescription qualitatively reproduces $\textit{all}$ observed trends, and also
quantitatively matches many of the observed results. Although there are some
statistically significant differences between our `halo mass only' mocks and

powerful outflow with an extreme blueshifted velocity of $\sim$-6000$\pm$500 km
s$^{-1}$ is shown in the CIV{\lambda}1549 emission line. A prominent
blueshifted component is also associated with the 1900{\AA} blend, resembling
the one observed in CIV{\lambda}1549. We detect a strong contribution of very
the low-ionization lines, FeII and Near-Infrared CaII triplet. We find that the
physical conditions for the low, intermediate and high-ionization emission
lines are different, which indicate that the emission lines are emitted in
different zones of the broad line region. The asymmetries shown by the profiles
reveal different forces over emitter zones. The high-ionization region is
strongly dominated by radiation forces, which also affect the low and

  Francisco",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, scholars from law and political science have introduced metrics
which use only election outcomes (and not district geometry) to assess the
presence of partisan gerrymandering. The most high-profile example of such a
tool is the efficiency gap. Some scholars have suggested that such tools should
be sensitive enough to alert us when two election outcomes have the same
percentage of votes going to political party $A$, but one of the two awards
party $A$ more seats. When a metric is able to distinguish election outcomes in
this way, that metric is said to satisfy the efficiency principle.
  In this article, we show that the efficiency gap fails to satisfy the
efficiency principle. We show precisely how the efficiency principle breaks
down in the presence of unequal voter turnout. To do this, we first present a
construction that, given any rationals $1/4< V<3/4$ and $0<S<1$, constructs an
election outcome with vote share $V$, seat share $S$, and EG = 0. (For
instance, one party can get 26% of the vote and anywhere from 1% to 99% of the
seats while the efficiency gap remains zero.) Then, for any election with vote
share $1/4<V<3/4$, seat share $S$, and EG= 0, we express the ratio $\rho$ of
average turnout in districts party $A$ lost to average turnout in districts
party $A$ won as a function in only $V$ and $S$. It is well known that when all

paper argues for a realist attitude towards quantum theory. In the second

that the physical variables in a contracting universe dominated by a scalar

result significantly generalizes a previous result \cite{Xue:2014} that did not
model random perturbations. This result implies that the extension from a

of state is robust, which is a surprising result. Implications for a purely

factor near the big bang.

define a {\it divergence distance} $D(x,y)$ from $x\in\Omega$ to $y\in\Omega$,
which takes into account the complex geometry of the domain. This distance
function is based on the concept of $f$-divergence, a distance measure
traditionally used to measure the difference between two probability
distributions. The relevant probability distributions in our case are the
Poisson kernels of the domain at $x$ and at $y$. We prove that for the
$\chi^2$-divergence distance, the gradient by $x$ of $D$ is opposite in
direction to the gradient by $x$ of $G(x,y)$, the Green's function with pole
$y$. Since $G$ is harmonic, this implies that $D$, like $G$, has a single
extremum in $\Omega$, namely at $y$ where $D$ vanishes. Thus $D$ can be used to
trace a gradient-descent path within~$\Omega$ from $x$ to $y$ by following
$\nabla_x D(x,y)$, which has significant computational advantages over tracing
the gradient of $G$. This result can be used for robotic path-planning in
complex geometric environments.

algorithm for 2-D purely stochastic state space models in the general Roesser

$Y_f^h$ projected onto $W_p^h$ along $\widehat{X}_f^{vh}$, where $W_p^h=
\begin{bmatrix}\widehat{X}_p^{vh} \\ Y_p^h \end{bmatrix}$, this presents a
problem since $\{\widehat{X}_p^{vh},\widehat{X}_f^{vh}\}$ are unknown. In the
above mentioned paper, the authors found that by doing an orthogonal projection
$Y_f^h/Y_p^h$, one can identify the future horizontal state matrix
$\widehat{X}_f^{h}$ with a small bias due to the initial conditions that depend
on $\{\widehat{X}_p^{vh},\widehat{X}_f^{vh}\}$. Nevertheless, the results on
modeling 2-D images were very good despite lack of knowledge of
$\{\widehat{X}_p^{vh},\widehat{X}_f^{vh}\}$. In this note we delve into the
bias term and prove that it is insignificant, provided $i$ is chosen large
enough and the vertical and horizontal states are uncorrelated. That is, the
cross covariance of the state estimates $x_{r,s}^{h}$ and $x_{r,s}^{v}$ is
zero, or $P_{hv}=0_{n_x\times n_x}$ and $P_{vh}=0_{n_x\times n_x}$. Our
simulations use $i=30$. We also present a second iteration to improve the state
estimates by including the vertical states computed from a vertical data
processing step, i.e., by doing an orthogonal projection $Y_f^v/Y_p^v$. In this
revised algorithm we include a step to compute the initial states. This new
portion, in addition to the algorithm presented in \cite{Ramos2017a}, forms a
complete 2-D stochastic subspace system identification algorithm.

computational methodology based on the notion of \G1 (this symbol is called
\emph{grossone}). The latter approach was developed with the intention to allow
one to work with infinities and infinitesimals numerically in a unique
computational framework and in all the situations requiring these notions.
Non-standard analysis is a classical purely symbolic technique that works with
ultrafilters, external and internal sets, standard and non-standard numbers,
etc. In its turn, the \G1-based methodology does not use any of these notions
and proposes a more physical treatment of mathematical objects separating the
objects from tools used to study them. It both offers a possibility to create
new numerical methods using infinities and infinitesimals in floating-point
computations and allows one to study certain mathematical objects dealing with
infinity more accurately than it is done traditionally. In these notes, we
explain that even though both methodologies deal with infinities and
infinitesimals, they are independent and represent two different philosophies
of Mathematics that are not in a conflict. It is proved that texts
\cite{Flunks, Gutman_Kutateladze_2008, Kutateladze_2011} asserting that the
\G1-based methodology is a part of non-standard analysis unfortunately contain
several logical fallacies. Their attempt to prove that the \G1-based
methodology is a part of non-standard analysis is similar to trying to show
that constructivism can be reduced to the traditional mathematics.
