age ($<$1 Gyr), the star presents an anomalously low stellar activity level:
the measured logR'$_{\rm HK}$ activity parameter lies slightly below the basal
level; there is no significant time-variability in the logR'$_{\rm HK}$ value;
there is no detection of the star in the X-rays. We present results of far-UV
observations of WASP-18 obtained with COS on board of Hubble Space Telescope
aimed at explaining this anomaly. From the star's spectral energy distribution,
we infer the extinction (E(B-V) $\approx$ 0.01 mag) and then the interstellar
medium (ISM) column density for a number of ions, concluding that ISM
absorption is not the origin of the anomaly. We measure the flux of the four
stellar emission features detected in the COS spectrum (CII, CIII, CIV, SiIV).
Comparing the CII/CIV flux ratio measured for WASP-18 with that derived from
spectra of nearby stars with known age, we see that the far-UV spectrum of
WASP-18 resembles that of old ($>$5 Gyr), inactive stars, in stark contrast
with its young age. We conclude that WASP-18 has an intrinsically low activity
level, possibly caused by star-planet tidal interaction, as suggested by
previous studies. Re-scaling the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match
the flux of the SiIV line, yields an XUV integrated flux at the planet orbit of
10.2 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We employ the rescaled XUV solar fluxes to models
of the planetary upper atmosphere, deriving an extremely low thermal mass-loss
rate of 10$^{-20}$ $M_{\rm J}$ Gyr$^{-1}$. For such high-mass planets, thermal
escape is not energy limited, but driven by Jeans escape.

describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during
music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined
within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic
music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with
different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG
measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to
quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the
structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific

graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical
modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying switching
nodes that consistently change module during music listening. Our results
suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization
and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed

  To Radial Imaging","References fixed",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To reconstruct artifact-free images from measured k-space data, when
the actual k-space trajectory deviates from the nominal trajectory due to
gradient imperfections.
  Methods: Trajectory errors arising from eddy currents and gradient delays
introduce phase inconsistencies in several fast scanning MR pulse sequences,
resulting in image artifacts. The proposed algorithm provides a novel framework
to compensate for this phase distortion. The algorithm relies on the
construction of a multi-block Hankel matrix, where each block is constructed
from k-space segments with the same phase distortion. In the presence of
spatially smooth phase distortions between the segments, the complete
block-Hankel matrix is known to be highly low-rank. Since each k-space segment
is only acquiring part of the k-space data, the reconstruction of the phase
compensated image from their partially parallel measurements is posed as a
structured low-rank matrix optimization problem, assuming the coil
sensitivities to be known.
  Results: The proposed formulation is tested on radial acquisitions in several
settings including partial Fourier and golden-angle acquisitions. The
experiments demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to successfully remove the
artifacts arising from the trajectory errors, without the need for trajectory
or phase calibration. The quality of the reconstruction was comparable to
corrections achieved using the Trajectory Auto-Corrected Image Reconstruction
(TrACR) for radial acquisitions.
  Conclusion: The proposed method provides a general framework for the recovery
of artifact-free images from radial trajectories without the need for
trajectory calibration.

  Massive MIMO Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The overheads associated with feedback-based channel acquisition can greatly
compromise the achievable rates of FDD based massive MIMO systems. Indeed,
downlink (DL) training and uplink (UL) feedback overheads scale linearly with
the number of base station (BS) antennas, in sharp contrast to TDD-based
massive MIMO, where a single UL pilot trains the whole BS array. In this work,
we propose a graph-theoretic approach to reducing DL training and UL feedback
overheads in FDD massive MIMO systems. In particular, we consider a single-cell
scenario involving a single BS with a massive antenna array serving to
single-antenna mobile stations (MSs) in the DL. We assume the BS employs
two-stage beamforming in the DL, comprising DFT pre-beamforming followed by
MU-MIMO precoding. The proposed graph-theoretic approach exploits knowledge of
the angular spectra of the BS-MS channels to construct DL training protocols
with reduced overheads. Simulation results reveal that the proposed
training-resources allocation method can provide approximately 35% sum-rate
performance gain compared to conventional orthogonal training. Our analysis

while positivity-preserving solutions to mixed derivative terms have received
much less attention. A two-dimensional diffusion equation, for which the
analytical solution is known, is solved numerically to show the applicability
of the scheme. It is further applied to the Fokker-Planck collision operator in
two-dimensional cylindrical coordinates under the assumption of local thermal
equilibrium. For a thermal equilibration problem, it is shown that the scheme
conserves particle number and energy, while the preservation of positivity is
ensured and the steady-state solution is the Maxwellian distribution.

  Convolutional Neural Networks using Stochastic Computing",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With recent trend of wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoTs), it
becomes attractive to develop hardware-based deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) for embedded applications, which require low power/energy consumptions
and small hardware footprints. Recent works demonstrated that the Stochastic
Computing (SC) technique can radically simplify the hardware implementation of
arithmetic units and has the potential to satisfy the stringent power
requirements in embedded devices. However, in these works, the memory design
optimization is neglected for weight storage, which will inevitably result in
large hardware cost. Moreover, if conventional volatile SRAM or DRAM cells are
utilized for weight storage, the weights need to be re-initialized whenever the
DCNN platform is re-started.
  In order to overcome these limitations, in this work we adopt an emerging
non-volatile Domain-Wall Memory (DWM), which can achieve ultra-high density, to
replace SRAM for weight storage in SC-based DCNNs. We propose DW-CNN, the first
comprehensive design optimization framework of DWM-based weight storage method.
We derive the optimal memory type, precision, and organization, as well as
whether to store binary or stochastic numbers. We present effective resource
sharing scheme for DWM-based weight storage in the convolutional and
fully-connected layers of SC-based DCNNs to achieve a desirable balance among
area, power (energy) consumption, and application-level accuracy.

present a randomization test that conditions on covariate balance by only
considering treatment assignments that are similar to the observed one in terms
of covariate balance. Previous conditional randomization tests have only
allowed for categorical covariates, while our randomization test allows for any

conditional randomization test is more powerful than unconditional
randomization tests and other conditional tests. Furthermore, we find that our
conditional randomization test is valid (1) unconditionally across levels of
covariate balance, and (2) conditional on particular levels of covariate

is a difficult process, involving many decisions concerning how best to
represent the information so that it will be captured or useful, and
hand-labeling large amounts of data. DeepType overcomes this challenge by
explicitly integrating symbolic information into the reasoning process of a
neural network with a type system. First we construct a type system, and
second, we use it to constrain the outputs of a neural network to respect the
symbolic structure. We achieve this by reformulating the design problem into a
mixed integer problem: create a type system and subsequently train a neural
network with it. In this reformulation discrete variables select which
parent-child relations from an ontology are types within the type system, while
continuous variables control a classifier fit to the type system. The original
problem cannot be solved exactly, so we propose a 2-step algorithm: 1)
heuristic search or stochastic optimization over discrete variables that define
a type system informed by an Oracle and a Learnability heuristic, 2) gradient
descent to fit classifier parameters. We apply DeepType to the problem of
Entity Linking on three standard datasets (i.e. WikiDisamb30, CoNLL (YAGO), TAC

their host stars. The emergent polarization is sensitive to aspects of the
planet atmosphere such as the gas composition and the occurrence of condensates
and their optical properties. Extracting this information will represent a
major step in the characterization of exoplanets. The numerical simulations
presented here show that the polarization of a spatially-unresolved exoplanet
may be detected by cross-correlating high-dispersion linear polarization and
intensity (brightness) spectra of the planet-star system. The Doppler shift of
the planet-reflected starlight facilitates the separation of this signal from
the polarization introduced by the interstellar medium and the terrestrial
atmosphere. The selection of the orbital phases and wavelengths at which to
study the planet is critical. An optimal choice however will partly depend on
information about the atmosphere that is a priori unknown. We elaborate on the
cases of close-in giant exoplanets with non-uniform cloud coverage, an outcome
of recent brightness phase curve surveys from space, and for which the
hemispheres east and west of the sub-stellar point will produce different
polarizations. With integration times on the order of hours at a 10-m
telescope, the technique might distinguish amongst some proposed asymmetric
cloud scenarios with fractional polarizations of 10 parts per million for one
such planet orbiting a V-mag=5.5 host star. Future 30-40-m telescopes equipped
with high-dispersion spectro-polarimeters will be able to investigate the
linear polarization of smaller planets orbiting fainter stars and look for
molecular features in their polarization spectra.

observational epochs in 2014 and 2017. A previously unconfirmed magnetic field
of the primary star has been securely detected. The polarisation signatures of
the secondary appear to have a systematically larger amplitude than that of the
primary. This corresponds to a stronger magnetic field, for which the magnetic
energy of the secondary exceeds that of the primary by a factor of 3.3-5.7.
While the magnetic energy is similar for the secondary star in the two epochs,
the magnetic energy is about twice as high in 2017 for the primary. The
magnetic field topology of the two stars in the earlier epoch (2014) is very
different. In the earlier epoch, the magnetic field at the visible pole appears
to be of opposite polarity for the primary and secondary, suggesting linked
magnetospheres. The apparent rotational periods of both $\sigma^2$ CrB
components are longer than the orbital period, which we interpret as an
evidence of a solar-like differential rotation. Despite their nearly identical

the polymer is stretched via two opposing forces applied on the first and last
monomer before and during translocation. In this setup, polymer translocation
is achieved by imposing a bias between the two pulling forces such that there
is net displacement towards the \textit{trans}-side. Under the influence of
pre-stretching forces, the elongated polymer ensemble contains less variations
in conformations compared to an unstretched ensemble. Simulations demonstrate
that this reduced spread in initial conformations yields a reduced variation in
translocations times relative to the mean translocation time. This effect is
explored for different ratios of the amplitude of thermal fluctuations to
driving forces to control for the relative influence of the thermal path
sampled by the polymer. Since the variance in translocation times is due to
contributions coming from sampling both thermal noise and initial
conformations, our simulations offer independent control over the two main
sources of noise, and allow us to shed light on how they both contribute to
translocation dynamics. Experimentally relevant conditions are highlighted and
shown to correspond to a significant decrease in the spread of translocation
times, thus indicating that stretching DNA prior to translocation could assist
in nanopore-based sequencing and sizing applications.

behavior of the spin Hall conductivity as a function of the ratio of the Rashba
(alpha) and Dresselhaus (beta) strengths was found for large enough SO
strengths. This behavior is signalled by a peak or a cusp, depending on the
strip width, at intermediate values of beta/alpha in the interval [0,1]. This
behavior of the spin Hall conductivity was correlated with the one for the
longitudinal spin conductivity. This study was then extended to the
out-of-equilibrium regime that arises by imposing a finite voltage bias between
the two ends of an open strip. This system, in the presence of a Hubbard term
with coupling U, was treated with the density matrix renormalization group
technique and with the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. It was found that relevant
properties to the spin Hall effect, such as the transversal spin current and
the spin accumulation, present a similar nonmonotonic behavior as the one found
for the spin conductivities. More importantly, it was also found that these
properties are enhanced by the repulsive Hubbard interaction up to a moderate
value of U.

simulation of Turbulent flow. The Turbulent flows are often stationary and
ergodic, after some initial transient time. Therefore, the time averaged of a
quantity (velocity, TKE (turbulence kinetic energy), total drag, etc) converges
to a constant as the averaging interval increases. This infinite-time-average
statistic is of particular interest in many problems, such as aerodynamic shape
optimization. Since taking an average over the infinite time horizon is not
possible, some finite-time approximation of the infinite-time-average statistic
of interest is used in practice. However, because of the initial transient
behavior of the turbulence simulations, this estimate is biased. This issue is
solved by deleting the initial transient part of the simulation. The other
important issue is the error of this approximation decreases slowly, like the
reciprocal of the square roots of the averaging time. In this paper, we develop
a framework to first automatically deleted the transient part of a turbulence

for temporal dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for
cluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the
dimensionality reduction objec tive. Based on requirement and application, the
temporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity
metric. Several similarity metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms are
considered and compared. To gain insight into temporal features that the
network has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that
generates a region of interest heatmap for the time series. The viability of
the algorithm is demonstrated using time series data from diverse domains,
ranging from earthquakes to spacecraft sensor data. In each case, we show that
the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods. The superior
performance is attributed to the fully integrated temporal dimensionality

confirm the benefit from the Max-SR-based PA strategy, we take the null-space

expression of optimal PA strategy. From simulation results, we find the
following facts: in the medium and high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions,
compared with three typical PA parameters such $\beta=0.1, 0.5$, and $0.9$, the
optimal PA shows a substantial SR performance gain with maximum gain percent up
to more than $60\%$. Additionally, as the PA factor increases from 0 to 1, the
achievable SR increases accordingly in the low SNR region whereas it first
increases and then decreases in the medium and high SNR regions, where the SR
can be approximately viewed as a convex function of the PA factor. Finally, as
the number of antennas increases, the optimal PA factor becomes large and tends
to one in the medium and high SNR region. In other words, the contribution of
AN to SR can be trivial in such a situation.

algorithms for solving nonconvex smooth optimization problems. Contemporary
analyses characterize worst-case performance by providing, under certain
assumptions on an objective function, an upper bound on the number of
iterations (or function or derivative evaluations) required until a pth-order
stationarity condition is approximately satisfied. This arguably leads to
conservative characterizations based on anomalous objectives rather than on
ones that are typically encountered in practice. By contrast, the strategy
proposed in this paper characterizes worst-case performance separately over
regions comprising a search space. These regions are defined generically based
on properties of derivative values. In this manner, one can analyze the
worst-case performance of an algorithm independently from any particular class
of objectives. Then, once given a class of objectives, one can obtain an
informative, fine-tuned complexity analysis merely by delineating the types of
regions that comprise the search spaces for functions in the class. Regions
defined by first- and second-order derivatives are discussed in detail and
example complexity analyses are provided for a few fundamental first- and
second-order algorithms when employed to minimize convex and nonconvex
objectives of interest. It is also explained how the strategy can be
generalized to regions defined by higher-order derivatives and for analyzing
the behavior of higher-order algorithms.

microemulsion and Ising critical states can mediate roughly equal levels of
kinase recruitment (binding energy ~ -0.6 kBT), whereas a membrane near a
tricritical point can mediate much stronger kinase recruitment (-1.7 kBT). By
comparing several models for lipid heterogeneity within a single theoretical

subtracting the foreground interstellar extinction. The distance of the
Monoceros SNR is determined to be $1.98\,$kpc, larger than previous values.
Meanwhile, the distance of the Rosette Nebula is $1.55\,$kpc, generally
consistent with previous work. The distance between these two nebulas suggests
no interaction between them. The distance of NGC 2264, $1.20\,$kpc, exceeds

for the Monoceros SNR, consistent with the average value 0.652 for the Milky

with random coefficients. A unified method is developed to treat both the
problems with deterministic risk-free return rate, state-dependent risk
aversion, and that with full random coefficients, constant risk aversion. To do
so, some new necessity conditions for the existence of equilibrium investment
strategies are established, which considerably extends the analogue in [9] with
distinctive ideas. Some new interesting facts are revealed. For example, if
risk-free return rate is random, it is shown that there exists a unique
open-loop equilibrium investment strategy relying on initial wealth, even when
risk aversion is merely a constant but not state-dependent.

Extreme-Value Analysis (EVA2017), with the goal of predicting daily
precipitation quantiles at the $99.8\%$ level for each month at observed and
unobserved locations. We here develop a Bayesian generalized additive modeling
framework tailored to estimate complex trends in marginal extremes observed
over space and time. Our approach is based on a set of regression equations
linked to the exceedance probability above a high threshold and to the size of
the excess, the latter being modeled using the generalized Pareto (GP)
distribution suggested by Extreme-Value Theory. Latent random effects are
modeled additively and semi-parametrically using Gaussian process priors, which
provides high flexibility and interpretability. Fast and accurate estimation of
posterior distributions may be performed thanks to the Integrated Nested
Laplace approximation (INLA), efficiently implemented in the R-INLA software,
which we also use for determining a nonstationary threshold based on a model
for the body of the distribution. We show that the GP distribution meets the
theoretical requirements of INLA, and we then develop a penalized complexity
prior specification for the tail index, which is a crucial parameter for
extrapolating tail event probabilities. This prior concentrates mass close to a
light exponential tail while allowing heavier tails by penalizing the distance
to the exponential distribution. We illustrate this methodology through the
modeling of spatial and seasonal trends in daily precipitation data provided by
the EVA2017 challenge. Capitalizing on R-INLA's fast computation capacities and
large distributed computing resources, we conduct an extensive cross-validation
study to select model parameters governing the smoothness of trends. Our
results outperform simple benchmarks and are comparable to the best-scoring

sensing cannot be used to this end because the paired receiver (RX) may
experience different levels of interference, according to the extent of their
separation, blockages, and beam directions. To address this problem, this paper
proposes a novel form of medium access control (MAC) termed sense-and-predict
(SaP), whereby each secondary TX predicts the interference level at the RX
based on the sensed interference at the TX; this can be quantified in terms of
a spatial interference correlation between the two locations. Using stochastic
geometry, the spatial interference correlation can be expressed in the form of
a conditional coverage probability, such that the signal-to-interference ratio
(SIR) at the RX is no less than a predetermined threshold given the sensed
interference at the TX, defined as an opportunistic probability (OP). The
secondary TX randomly accesses the spectrum depending on OP. We optimize the
SaP framework to maximize the area spectral efficiencies (ASEs) of secondary
networks while guaranteeing the service quality of the primary networks.
Testbed experiments using USRP and MATLAB simulations show that SaP affords
higher ASEs compared with CR without prediction.

problems in vibroacoustics. Like other Trefftz methods, it employs a
non-standard discretisation basis consisting of solutions of the partial
differential equation (PDE) at hand. We analyse the convergence and numerical
stability of the Wave Based Method for Helmholtz problems using tools from
approximation theory. We show that the set of discretisation functions more
closely resembles a frame, a redundant set of functions, than a basis. The
redundancy of a frame typically leads to ill-conditioning, which indeed is
common in Trefftz methods. Recent theoretical results on frames for function
approximation suggest that the associated ill-conditioned system matrix can be
successfully regularised, with error bounds available, when using a discrete
least squares approach. While the original Wave Based Method is based on a
weighted residual formulation, in this paper we pursue an oversampled
collocation approach instead. We show that, for smooth scattering obstacles in
two dimensions, the results closely follow the theory of frames. We identify
cases where the method achieves very high accuracy whilst providing a solution
with small norm coefficients, in spite of ill-conditioning. Moreover, the
accurate results are reliably maintained even in parameter regimes associated

satisfying $\chi(T)<\chi(H)$. This can be dated back to Erd\H{o}s, where he
generalized the celebrated Tur\'an's theorem by showing that for any $r\geq m$,
the Tur\'an graph $T_r(n)$ uniquely attains $ex(n,K_m,K_{r+1})$. For general
graphs $H$ with $\chi(H)=r+1>m$, Alon and Shikhelman showed that
$ex(n,K_m,H)=\binom{r}{m}(\frac{n}{r})^m+o(n^m)$. Here we determine this error
term $o(n^m)$ up to a constant factor. We prove that
$ex(n,K_m,H)=\binom{r}{m}(\frac{n}{r})^m+biex(n,H)\cdot\Theta(n^{m-2})$, where
$biex(n,H)$ is the Tur\'an number of the decomposition family of $H$. As a
special case, we extend Erd\H{o}s' result, by showing that $T_r(n)$ uniquely
attains $ex(n,K_m,H)$ for any edge-critical graph $H$. We also consider $T$
being non-clique, where even the simplest case seems to be intricate. Following
from a more general result, we show that for all $s\leq t$, $T_2(n)$ maximizes

particles [Phys. Rev. Lett 85, 5042 (2000), Phys. Lett. B 675, 1 (2009)]. This
correlation information, which has not yet been proved locally observable in
principle, is named by dark information. In this paper, we systematically study
the influences of dark energy on black hole radiation, especially on the dark
information. Calculating the radiation spectrum in the existence of dark energy
by the approach of canonical typicality, which is reconfirmed by the quantum
tunneling method, we find that the dark energy will effectively lower the
Hawking temperature, and thus makes the black hole has longer life time. It is
also discovered that the non-thermal effect of the black hole radiation is
enhanced by dark energy so that the dark information of the radiation is
increased. Our observation shows that, besides the mechanical effect (e.g.,
gravitational lensing effect), the dark energy rises the the stored dark
information, which could be probed by a non-local coincidence measurement
similar to the coincidence counting of the Hanbury-Brown -Twiss experiment in
quantum optics.

of the sample, and test the impact of using effective temperatures from either
spectroscopy or the infrared flux method. An offset of 3%, showing no
dependency on any stellar parameters, is found between seismic parallaxes

radii from the scaling relations, a smaller offset is found on average;
however, the offset becomes temperature dependent which we interpret as

hotter infrared flux method temperature scale, there is no indication that
radii from the scaling relations are inaccurate by more than about 5%. Taking
the radii and masses from the modelling of individual frequencies as reference

overestimate radii and masses at high temperatures, and that they are accurate

despite its fundamental importance, such a characteristic energy scale has not
been robustly identified. Inspired by the accumulated evidence regarding the
crucial role played by soft quasilocalized excitations in glassy dynamics, we
propose that the bulk average of the glass response to a localized force dipole
defines such a characteristic energy scale. We show that this characteristic
glassy energy scale features remarkable properties: $(i)$ It increases
dramatically with decreasing temperature of equilibrium supercooled states,
significantly surpassing the corresponding increase in the shear modulus,
dismissing the common view that structural variations in supercooled liquids
upon vitrification are minute $(ii)$ Its variation with annealing and system
size is very similar in magnitude and form to that of the energy of the softest
non-phononic vibrational mode, thus establishing a very unusual relation
between a rare glassy fluctuation and a bulk average $(iii)$ It exhibits
striking dependence on spatial dimensionality and system size, due to the
long-ranged fields associated with quasilocalization, which are speculated to
be related to peculiarities of the glass transition in two dimensions. In
addition, we identify a truly-static growing lengthscale associated with the
characteristic glassy energy scale, and discuss possible connections between
the increase of this energy scale and the slowing down of dynamics near the

case to one client and one server. Imagine a scenario where a Data Owner
encrypts its data before outsourcing it to the Cloud Service Provider and a
Data Analyst wants to execute private range queries on this data. This scenario
occurs in many cases of collaborative machine learning where data source and
processor are different entities. Then either the Data Owner must reveal its
encryption key or the Data Analyst must reveal the private queries. In this
paper, we overcome this limitation by allowing the equivalent of a public-key
order-preserving encryption. We present a secure multiparty protocol that
enables secure range queries for multiple users. In this scheme, the Data
Analyst cooperates with the Data Owner and the Cloud Service Provider in order
to order-preserving encrypt the private range queries without revealing any
other information to the parties. We implemented our scheme and observed that
if the database size of the Data Owner has 1 million entries it takes only
about 0.3 s on average via a loopback interface (1.3 s via a LAN) to encrypt an
input of the Data Analyst.

2-groups along with explicit examples coming from non-abelian 1- and 2-form

tensor networks, to compute the parallel transport along a surface using
approximations on a lattice. Although this work is mainly intended as
expository, we prove a convergence theorem for the surface transport in the
continuum limit. Locality is used to define infinitesimal parallel transport
and two- dimensional algebra is used to derive finite versions along arbitrary
surfaces with sufficient orientation data. The correct surface ordering is
dictated by two-dimensional algebra and leads to an interesting diagrammatic
picture for gauge fields interacting with particles and strings on a lattice.
The surface ordering is inherently complicated, but we prove a simplification
theorem confirming earlier results of Schreiber and Waldorf. Assuming little
background, we present a simple way to understand some abstract concepts of
higher category theory. In doing so, we review all the necessary categorical
concepts from the tensor network point of view as well as many aspects of

molecules. The formation of the grain mantles has two important consequences:
it removes species from the gas phase and promotes the synthesis of new
molecules on the grain surfaces. The composition of the mantle is a strong
function of the environment which the cloud belongs to. Therefore, clouds in
high-zeta galaxies, where conditions -like temperature, metallicity and cosmic
rays flux- are different from those in the Milky Way, will have different grain
mantles. In the last years, several authors have suggested that silicate grains
might grow by accretion of silicon bearing species on smaller seeds. This would
occur simultaneously to the formation of the iced mantles and be greatly
affected by its composition as a function of time. In this work, we present a
numerical study of the grain mantle formation in high-zeta galaxies and we
quantitatively address the possibility of silicate growth. We find that the
mantle thickness decreases with increasing redshift, from about 120 to 20
layers for z varying from 0 to 8. Furthermore, the mantle composition is also a
strong function of the cloud redshift, with the relative importance of CO, CO2,
ammonia, methane and methanol highly varying with z. Finally, being Si-bearing
species always a very minor component of the mantle, the formation of silicates
in molecular clouds is practically impossible.

study the properties of the diffuse Galactic polarized synchrotron as a
contaminant to CMB B-mode observations. We study the angular distribution of
the S-PASS signal at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes by means of
angular power spectra. Power spectra, show a decay of the spectral amplitude as
a function of multipole for \ell<200, typical of the diffuse emission. Spectra
can be approximated by a power law C_{\ell}\propto\ell^{alpha}, with alpha~-3,
and characterized by a B-to-E ratio of ~0.5. We study the synchrotron SED in
polarization by computing power spectra of the low frequency WMAP and Planck
maps. Results show that the SED, in the frequency range 2.3-33 GHz, is
compatible with a power law with beta_s=-3.22\pm0.08. Combining S-PASS
polarization maps with those coming from WMAP and Planck we derived a map of
the synchrotron spectral index at angular resolution of 2{\deg} on about 30% of
the sky. The recovered distribution peaks at the value around -3.2. We also
measure a significant spatial correlation between synchrotron and thermal dust
signals, as traced by the Planck 353 GHz channel. This correlation reaches
about 40% on the larger angular scales, decaying considerably at the degree
scales. Finally, we use the S-PASS maps to assess the polarized synchrotron
contamination to CMB observations of the B-modes. Moreover, by combining S-PASS
data with Planck 353 GHz observations, we recover a map of the minimum level of
total polarized foreground contamination to B-modes, finding that there is no
region of the sky, at any frequency, where this contamination lies below
equivalent tenor-to-scalar ratio ~10^-3. This result confirms the importance of
observing both high and low frequency foregrounds in CMB B-mode measurements.

Complex functions other than emission or detection remain challenging and
addressing a single structure in a full network proves a formidable challenge.

optomechanical crystals by external optical pumping, effectively creating a
phonon switch working at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature and the
working speed of which (5 MHz) is only limited by the mechanical motion of the
optomechanical structure. We additionally demonstrate two other switching
schemes: harmonic switching in which the mechanical mode remains active but
different harmonics of the optical force are used, and switching to- and from
the chaotic regime. Furthermore, the method presented here allows to select any
single structure without affecting its surroundings, which is an important step
towards freely controllable networks of optomechanical phonon emitters.

tracers, and then flushed with tracer-free fluid while the effluent
breakthrough curves were measured. The focus for this work is to examine a
hierarchy of four models (in the absence of adjustable parameters) with
decreasing complexity to assess their ability to accurately represent the
measured breakthrough curves. The most information-rich model was (1) a direct
numerical simulation of the system in which the geometry, boundary and initial
conditions, and medium properties were fully independently characterized
experimentally with high fidelity. The reduced models included; (2) a
simplified numerical model identical to the fully-resolved direct numerical
simulation (DNS) model, but using a domain that was one-tenth the size; (3) an
upscaled mobile-immobile model that allowed for a time-dependent mass-transfer
coefficient; and, (4) an upscaled mobile-immobile model that assumed a
space-time constant mass-transfer coefficient. The results illustrated that all
four models provided accurate representations of the experimental breakthrough
curves as measured by global RMS error. The primary component of error induced
in the upscaled models appeared to arise from the neglect of convection within
the inclusions. Interestingly, these results suggested that the conventional
convection-dispersion equation, when applied in a way that resolves the
heterogeneities, yields models with high fidelity without requiring the

regularization and non-linear symbolic regression using genetic programming.
The data for this project is representative of a contemporary fMRI experimental
design for visual stimuli. Linear and non-linear models were generated for 10
subjects, with another 4 withheld for validation. Model quality is evaluated by
comparing $R$ scores (Pearson product-moment correlation) in various contexts,
including single run self-fit, within-subject generalization, and
between-subject generalization. Propensity for modelling strategies to overfit
is estimated using a separate resting state scan. Results suggest that neither
method is objectively or inherently better than the other.

coating technique starting from a solution with Cu and Zn. The speed of spin
coating and time duration were varied to fabricate a film with required uniform
thickness. Samples were subsequently annealed in air at different annealing
temperatures to crystallize the phase of CuO. Doping concentration of Zn2+ was
varied up to weight percentage of 10%. Structural properties of samples were
determined using X-ray diffraction technique. Particle size, dislocation
density and strain at different doping concentrations were determined using XRD
patterns. Optical properties were measured by means of UV/Vis spectrometer.
Optical band gap of CuO could be tailored by doping a trace amount of Zn2+. The
optical band gap decreases with increase of particle size. The particle size,
dislocation density, strain and optical band gap have a turning point close to
the doping concentration of 6%.

photons existing in a superconducting medium. Accordingly, the Josephson
coupling energy is found to be equal to the rest mass energy of these photons.
The Josephson effect is described by propagation of massive photon field
following the universal quantum equation instead of being due to quantum
tunnelling. The mass of the photon is found to be dependent on the electric
properties of the junction. A characteristic (critical) quantized capacitance
of the junction is found to be inversely related to the critical current. The
quantum (kinetic) inductance induced in the junction is found to be equal to
$L_q=\mu_0\lambda_J$\,, where $\lambda_J$ is the Josephson penetration depth,
and $\mu_0$ is the free space permeability.

Problem with Private fleet and common Carrier (VRPPC) has been introduced to
manage package delivery services from a supplier to customers. However, almost
all of existing studies focus on the deterministic problem that assumes all
parameters are known perfectly at the time when the planning and routing
decisions are made. In reality, some parameters are random and unknown.
Therefore, in this paper, we consider VRPPC with hard time windows and random
demand, called Optimal Delivery Planning (ODP). The proposed ODP aims to
minimize the total package delivery cost while meeting the customer time window
constraints. We use stochastic integer programming to formulate the
optimization problem incorporating the customer demand uncertainty. Moreover,
we evaluate the performance of the ODP using test data from benchmark dataset
and from actual Singapore road map.
