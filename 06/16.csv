First, a variational autoencoder for domain B is trained. Then, given the new

layers that are close to the image in order to directly fit x, and only
indirectly adapt the other layers. Our experiments indicate that the new method

of this emerging G.fast system. In this paper, we propose a novel differential
evolution algorithm (DEA) aided turbo channel estimation (CE) and multi-user
detection (MUD) scheme for the G.fast upstream including the frequency band up
to 212 MHz, which is capable of approaching the optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound
of the channel estimate, whilst approaching the optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
MUD's performance associated with perfect channel state information, and yet
only imposing about 5% of its computational complexity. Explicitly, the turbo
concept is exploited by iteratively exchanging information between the
continuous value-based DEA assisted channel estimator and the discrete
value-based DEA MUD. Our extensive simulations show that 18 dB normalized mean
square error gain is attained by the channel estimator and 10 dB
signal-to-noise ratio gain can be achieved by the MUD upon exploiting this
iteration gain. We also quantify the influence of the CE error, of the copper
length and of the impulse noise. Our study demonstrates that the proposed DEA

an analysis of the kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars

Galactic components, the thick disk and the stellar halo. We demonstrate that
the inner halo is dominated by debris from an object which at infall was
slightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we refer to as
Gaia-Enceladus. The stars originating in Gaia-Enceladus cover nearly the full
sky, their motions reveal the presence of streams and slightly retrograde and
elongated trajectories. Hundreds of RR Lyrae stars and thirteen globular
clusters following a consistent age-metallicity relation can be associated to
Gaia-Enceladus on the basis of their orbits. With an estimated 4:1 mass-ratio,
the merger with Gaia-Enceladus must have led to the dynamical heating of the
precursor of the Galactic thick disk and therefore contributed to the formation
of this component approximately 10 Gyr ago. These findings are in line with
simulations of galaxy formation, which predict that the inner stellar halo

(bores) can be described by a two-layer hydrostatic shallow-water (SW)
approximation without invoking additional front conditions. The theory is based
on a new SW momentum equation which is derived in locally conservative form
containing a free parameter $\alpha.$ This parameter, which defines the
relative contribution of each layer to the pressure at the interface, affects
only hydraulic jumps but not continuous waves. The Rankine-Hugoniot jump
conditions for the momentum and mass conservation equations are found to be
mathematically equivalent to the classical front conditions, which were
previously thought to be outside the scope of SW approximation. Dimensional
arguments suggest that $\alpha$ depends on the density ratio. For nearly equal
densities, both layers are expected to affect interfacial pressure with
approximately equal weight coefficients, which corresponds to $\alpha\approx0.$
The front propagation velocity for $\alpha=0$ agrees well with experimental and
numerical results in a wide range of bore strengths. A remarkably better
agreement with high-accuracy numerical results is achieved by
$\alpha=\sqrt{5}-2,$ which yields the largest height that a stable gravity

channels. These channels are relevant from a quantum thermodynamical viewpoint
because they correspond to the energy-preserving linear coupling of a bosonic
system with a bosonic environment that is in a passive state (no energy can be
extracted from it by using a unitary transformation) followed by discarding the
environment. The Fock-majorization relation defined in [New J. Phys. 18, 073047
(2016)] happens to be especially useful in this context as, unlike regular
majorization, it connects the disorder of a state together with its energy. Our
main result here is the preservation of Fock majorization across all
passive-environment bosonic channels. This implies a similar preservation
property for regular majorization over the set of passive states, and it also
extends to passive-environment channels whose Stinespring dilation involves an
active Gaussian unitary. Beyond bosonic systems, the introduced class of
passive environment operations naturally generalizes thermal operations and is
expected to provide new insights into the thermodynamics of quantum systems.

coupling, is usually frustrated by dipolar interaction. As a result, the
uniformly ordered phase is replaced by modulated (multi-domain) phases,
characterized by different order parameters rather than the global
magnetization. The transitions occurring within those modulated phases and
towards the disordered phase are generally not of second-order type.
Nevertheless, strong experimental evidence indicates that a standard critical
behavior is recovered when comparatively small fields are applied that
stabilize the uniform phase. The resulting power laws are observed with respect
to a putative critical point that falls in the portion of the phase diagram
occupied by modulated phases, in line with an avoided-criticality scenario.
Here we propose a generalization of the scaling hypothesis for ferromagnets,
which explains this observation assuming that the dipolar interaction acts as a

deployment of classification algorithms in various social contexts. Several
recent works have focused on fairness with respect to a specific metric,
modeled the corresponding fair classification problem as a constrained
optimization problem, and developed tailored algorithms to solve them. Despite
this, there still remain important metrics for which we do not have fair
classifiers and many of the aforementioned algorithms do not come with
theoretical guarantees; perhaps because the resulting optimization problem is
non-convex. The main contribution of this paper is a new meta-algorithm for
classification that takes as input a large class of fairness constraints, with
respect to multiple non-disjoint sensitive attributes, and which comes with
provable guarantees. This is achieved by first developing a meta-algorithm for
a large family of classification problems with convex constraints, and then
showing that classification problems with general types of fairness constraints
can be reduced to those in this family. We present empirical results that show
that our algorithm can achieve near-perfect fairness with respect to various
fairness metrics, and that the loss in accuracy due to the imposed fairness
constraints is often small. Overall, this work unifies several prior works on
fair classification, presents a practical algorithm with theoretical
guarantees, and can handle fairness metrics that were previously not possible.

perturbations that are in conflict with observations of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). In this paper, we demonstrate how this problem can be solved
in low-scale models of hybrid inflation that may emerge from supersymmetric
grand unified theories. We consider both F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) and
D-term hybrid inflation (DHI) in supergravity, explicitly taking into account
the effect of hidden-sector supersymmetry breaking. We discuss the production
of cosmic strings and show how the soft terms in the scalar potential readily
allow to achieve the correct scalar spectral index. In both cases, we are able
to identify large regions in parameter space that are consistent with all
constraints. In particular, we find that evading the CDM isocurvature
constraint always requires a small Yukawa or gauge coupling of O(10^-3) or
smaller. This translates into upper bounds on the gravitino mass of O(10^5) GeV
in FHI and O(10^9) GeV in DHI. Our results point to interesting scenarios in
well-motivated parameter regions that will be tested in future axion and CMB

that the system might not have yet reached its deep quiescent state. The
ultraviolet data exhibit a 20% decline in the continuum flux from the

We suggest that a decline across each recurring nova eruption might help
explain the proposed 2mag steady decline of the system since 1866. Using an
improved version of our accretion disk model as well as International
Ultraviolet Explorer ultraviolet and optical data, and the 4.8 kpc distance, we
corroborate our previous findings that the quiescent mass accretion rate in T
Pyx is of the order of 1e-6 Solar mass per year. Such a large mass accretion
rate would imply that the mass of the white dwarf is increasing with time.
However, with the just-release Gaia DR 2 distance of 3.3 kpc (after submission
of the first version of this manuscript), we find a mass accretion of the order
of 1e-7 Solar mass per year. Our results predict powerful soft X-ray or extreme
ultraviolet emission from the hot inner region of the high accretion rate disk.
Using constraining X-ray observations and assuming the accretion disk doesn't
depart too much from the standard model, we are left with two possible
scenarios. The disk either emits mainly extreme ultraviolet radiation which, at
a distance of a few kpc, is completely absorbed by the interstellar medium, or
the hot inner disk, emitting soft X-rays, is masked by the bulging disk seen at
a higher inclination.

(UNM; $250< T_s < 1000\rm\,K$) and warm neutral medium (WNM; $T_s >

the majority of which is CNM (56 +/- 10%, corresponding to 28% of the total HI
mass). Although CNM is detected ubiquitously, the CNM fraction along most lines
of sight is <50%. We find that 20% of the total HI mass is thermally unstable
(41 +/- 10% of HI detected in absorption), with no significant variation with
Galactic environment. Finally, although the WNM comprises 52% of the total HI
mass, we detect little evidence for WNM absorption with $1000<T_s<4000\rm\,K$.
Following spectral modeling, we detect a stacked residual absorption feature
corresponding to WNM with $T_s\sim10^4\rm\,K$. We conclude that excitation in
excess of collisions likely produces significantly higher WNM $T_s$ than
predicted by steady-state models.

S0 or E/S0 morphologies, for a wide variety of orbits and even in gas-poor
cases. 2) Contrary to popular expectations, most of them do not exhibit any
morphological traces of their past merger origin under typical observing
conditions and at distances as nearby as 30 Mpc. 3) The merger relics are more
persistent in minor mergers than in major ones for similar relaxing time
periods. 4) No major-merger S0-like remnant develops a significant bar. 5)
Nearly 58% of the major-merger S0 remnants host visually detectable ICs, such
as embedded inner discs, rings, pseudo-rings, inner spirals, nuclear bars, and
compact sources, very frequent in real S0s too. 6) All remnants contain a lens
or oval, identically ubiquitous in local S0s. 7) These lenses and ovals do not
come from bar dilution in major merger cases, but are associated with stellar
halos or embedded inner discs instead (thick or thin). We conclude that the
relaxed morphologies, lenses, ovals, and other ICs of real S0s do not
necessarily come from internal secular evolution, gas infall or environmental
mechanisms, as traditionally assumed, but they can result from major mergers as
well.

two-dimensional quantum field theory with a nonrelativistic global symmetry
acting on the worldsheet fields. Nonrelativistic string theory is unitary,
ultraviolet complete and has a string spectrum and spacetime S-matrix enjoying
nonrelativistic symmetry. The worldsheet theory of nonrelativistic string
theory is coupled to a curved spacetime background and to a Kalb-Ramond
two-form and dilaton field. The appropriate spacetime geometry for
nonrelativistic string theory is dubbed string Newton-Cartan geometry, which is
distinct from Riemannian geometry. This defines the sigma model of
nonrelativistic string theory describing strings propagating and interacting in
curved background fields. We also implement T-duality transformations in the
path integral of this sigma model and uncover the spacetime interpretation of
T-duality. We show that T-duality along the longitudinal direction of the
string Newton-Cartan geometry describes relativistic string theory on a
Lorentzian geometry with a compact lightlike isometry, which is otherwise only
defined by a subtle infinite boost limit. This relation provides a first
principles definition of string theory in the discrete light cone quantization
(DLCQ) in an arbitrary background, a quantization that appears in
nonperturbative approaches to quantum field theory and string/M-theory, such as
in Matrix theory. T-duality along a transverse direction of the string
Newton-Cartan geometry equates nonrelativistic string theory in two distinct,
T-dual backgrounds.

the COSMOS field using the spectroscopic redshifts of the VIMOS Ultra-Deep
Survey (VUDS), complemented by the zCOSMOS-Deep sample and high-quality
photometric redshifts. The method relies on a 2D Voronoi tessellation in
overlapping redshift slices that is converted into a 3D density field. The
galaxy distribution is constructed using a statistical treatment of
spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. We identify a proto-supercluster,
dubbed ""Hyperion"" for its immense size and mass, which extends over a volume of
~60x60x150 comoving Mpc^3 and has an estimated total mass of ~4.8x 10^15 M_sun.
This immensely complex structure contains at least 7 density peaks within 2.4 <
z < 2.5, connected by filaments. Based on the peaks average matter density, we
estimate their total mass, M_tot, and find a range of masses from ~0.1x10^14
M_sun to ~2.7x10^14 M_sun. By using spectroscopic members of each peak, we
obtain the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the peaks, and then their
virial mass M_vir (under the strong assumption that they are virialised). The
agreement between M_vir and M_tot is surprisingly good, considering that almost
all the peaks are probably not yet virialised. According to the spherical
collapse model, the peaks have already started or are about to start
collapsing, and they are all predicted to be virialised by redshift z~0.8-1.6.
We finally perform a careful comparison with the literature, given that smaller
components of this proto-supercluster had previously been identified using
heterogeneous galaxy samples. With VUDS, we obtain a panoramic view of this
large structure, that encompasses, connects, and considerably expands in a
homogeneous way on all previous detections of the various sub-components. This
provides us the unique possibility to study a rich supercluster in formation.

(CBPs). Although currently not detected, exomoons could be orbiting some of
these CBPs, and they might be suitable for harboring life. A necessary
condition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical
stability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler
CBPs using numerical $N$-body integrations. We determine regions of stability
and obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial
exolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial
inclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the
orbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,
for most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location
of the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of
the moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the
binary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and
which is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,
the evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons
in dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering
strong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct
collisions. This suggests that there is a dearth of highly-inclined exomoons
around the Kepler CBPs, whereas coplanar exomoons are dynamically allowed.

find 22 such counterparts in DR2, of which 12 have statistically sig- nificant
measurements of parallax. These DR2 optical proper motions and parallaxes
provide new measurements of the distances and transverse velocities of the
associated pulsars. For the most part, the results agree with existing radio
interferometric and pulsar timing-based astrometry, as well as other distance
estimates based on photometry or associations, and for some pulsars they
provide the best known distance and velocity estimates. In particular, two of
these pulsars have no previous dis- tance measurement: PSR J1227$-$4853, for
which Gaia measures a parallax of $0.62\pm 0.16$ mas, and PSR J1431$-$4715,
with a Gaia parallax of $0.64\pm 0.16$ mas. Using the Gaia distance
measurements, we find that dispersion measure-based distance estimates
calculated using the NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic electron density models are on
average slightly underestimated, which may be a selection effect due to the
over-representation of pulsars at high Galactic latitudes in the present Gaia
sample. While the Gaia DR2 results do not quite match the precision that can be
achieved by dedicated pulsar timing or radio interferometry, taken together
they constitute a small but important improvement to the pulsar distance scale,
and the subset of millisecond pulsars with distances measured by Gaia may help
improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays to nanohertz gravitational
waves.

of locally indistinguishable states on spaces with non-trivial topology. These
degenerate states form a representation of the mapping class group (MCG) of the
space, which is generated by braids of defects or anyons, and by Dehn twists
along non-contractible cycles. These operations can be viewed as fault-tolerant
logical gates in the context of topological quantum error correcting codes and
topological quantum computation. Here we show that braids and Dehn twists can
in general be implemented by a constant depth quantum circuit, with a depth
that is independent of code distance $d$ and system size. The circuit consists
of a constant depth local quantum circuit (LQC) implementing a local geometry
deformation of the quantum state, followed by a permutation on (relabelling of)
the qubits. The permutation requires permuting qubits that are separated by a
distance of order $d$; it can be implemented by collective classical motion of
mobile qubits or as a constant depth circuit using long-range SWAP operations
(with a range set by $d$) on immobile qubits. Applying these results to certain
non-Abelian quantum error correcting codes demonstrates how universal logical
gate sets can be implemented on encoded qubits using only constant depth
unitary circuits.

effective field theories (EFTs) of massless particles via the consistency of
the low-energy S-matrix. Given assumptions on the on-shell data (particle
spectra, linear symmetries, and low-energy theorems), the soft bootstrap is an
efficient algorithm for determining the possible consistency of an EFT with
those properties. The implementation of the soft bootstrap uses the recently
discovered method of soft subtracted recursion. We derive a precise criterion
for the validity of these recursion relations and show that they fail exactly
when the assumed symmetries can be trivially realized by independent operators
in the effective action. We use this to show that the possible pure (real and
complex) scalar, fermion, and vector exceptional EFTs are highly constrained.
Next, we prove how the soft behavior of states in a supermultiplet must be
related and illustrate the results in extended supergravity. We demonstrate the
power of the soft bootstrap in two applications. First, for the N= 1 and N=2
CP^1 nonlinear sigma models, we show that on-shell constructibility establishes
the emergence of accidental IR symmetries. This includes a new on-shell
perspective on the interplay between N=2 supersymmetry, low-energy theorems,
and electromagnetic duality. We also show that N=2 supersymmetry requires
3-point interactions with the photon that make the soft behavior of the scalar
O(1) instead of vanishing, despite the underlying symmetric coset. Second, we
study Galileon theories, including aspects of supersymmetrization, the
possibility of a vector-scalar Galileon EFT, and the existence of
higher-derivative corrections preserving the enhanced special Galileon
symmetry. This is addressed by soft bootstrap and by application of
double-copy/KLT relations applied to higher-derivative corrections of chiral
perturbation theory.

nanostructures has recently been suggested as a promising way towards improving
man-made light harvesting materials. However, realising and testing the
dissipative system-environment models underlying these proposals is presently
very challenging in supramolecular materials. A promising alternative is to use
simpler and highly tunable quantum simulators built from programmable qubits,
as recently achieved in a superconducting circuit by Potocnik et al. In this
article, we simulate the real-time dynamics of an exciton coupled to a quantum
bath as it moves through a network based on the quantum circuit of Potocnik et
al. Using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion to capture the
open quantum system dynamics, we find that an ultrafast but completely
incoherent relaxation from a high-lying bright exciton into a doublet of
closely spaced dark excitons can spontaneously generate electronic coherences
and oscillatory real-space motion across the network (quantum beats).
Importantly, we show that this behaviour also survives when the environmental
noise is classically stochastic (effectively high temperature), as in present
experiments, and also leads to a novel, transient violation of detailed balance
in the population relaxation. These predictions highlight the possibilities of
designing matched electronic and spectral noise structures for robust coherence
generation that does not require coherent excitation or cold environments.

potassium (K I) resonance doublets, have long been predicted in the optical
atmospheric spectra of cloud-free irradiated gas-giant exoplanets1,2,3.
However, observations have only revealed the narrow cores of these features

the day-night planetary terminator are considered responsible for obscuring the
absorption-line wings, which hinders constraints on absolute atmospheric

'hot-Saturn' WASP-96b obtained with the Very Large Telescope, which exhibits
the complete pressure-broadened profile of the sodium absorption feature. The
spectrum is in excellent agreement with cloud-free, solar-abundance models
assuming chemical equilibrium. We are able to measure a precise, absolute
sodium abundance of log\epsilon_Na=6.9+0.6-0.4, and use it as a proxy to the
planet's atmospheric metallicity relative to the solar value
(Z_p/Z_\star=2.3+8.9/--1.7). This result is consistent with the

defined on an edge-weighted graph with $k$ distinct vertices called
""terminals."" The goal is to remove a minimum weight collection of edges from
the graph such that there is no path between any pair of terminals. The problem
is NP-hard.
  Isolating cuts are minimum cuts that separate one terminal from the rest. The
union of all the isolating cuts, except the largest, is a
$(2-2/k)$-approximation to the optimal k-Terminal Cut. This is the only
currently-known approximation algorithm for k-Terminal Cut which does not
require solving a linear program.
  An instance of k-Terminal Cut is $\gamma$-stable if edges in the cut can be
multiplied by up to $\gamma$ without changing the unique optimal solution. In
this paper, we show that, in any $(k-1)$-stable instance of k-Terminal Cut, the
source sets of the isolating cuts are the source sets of the unique optimal
solution of that k-Terminal Cut instance. We conclude that the
$(2-2/k)$-approximation algorithm returns the optimal solution on
$(k-1)$-stable instances. Ours is the first result showing that this
$(2-2/k)$-approximation is an exact optimization algorithm on a special class
of graphs.
  We also show that our $(k-1)$-stability result is tight. We construct
$(k-1-\epsilon)$-stable instances of the k-Terminal Cut problem which only have
trivial isolating cuts: that is, the source set of the isolating cuts for each
terminal is just the terminal itself. Thus, the $(2-2/k)$-approximation does
not return an optimal solution.

bounds for homogeneous depth-4 arithmetic circuits, which has brought us very
close to statements that are known to imply $\textsf{VP} \neq \textsf{VNP}$. It
is open if these techniques can go beyond homogeneity, and in this paper we
make some progress in this direction by considering depth-4 circuits of low
algebraic rank, which are a natural extension of homogeneous depth-4 circuits.
A depth-4 circuit is a representation of an $N$-variate, degree-$n$ polynomial
$P$ as \[ P = \sum_{i = 1}^T Q_{i1}\cdot Q_{i2}\cdot \cdots \cdot Q_{it} \; ,
\] where the $Q_{ij}$ are given by their monomial expansion. Homogeneity adds
the constraint that for every $i \in [T]$, $\sum_{j} \operatorname{deg}(Q_{ij})
= n$. We study an extension, where, for every $i \in [T]$, the algebraic rank
of the set $\{Q_{i1}, Q_{i2}, \ldots ,Q_{it}\}$ of polynomials is at most some
parameter $k$. Already for $k = n$, these circuits are a generalization of the
class of homogeneous depth-4 circuits, where in particular $t \leq n$ (and
hence $k \leq n$).
  We study lower bounds and polynomial identity tests for such circuits and
prove the following results. We show an $\exp{(\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log N))}$ lower
bound for such circuits for an explicit $N$ variate degree $n$ polynomial
family when $k \leq n$. We also show quasipolynomial hitting sets when the
degree of each $Q_{ij}$ and the $k$ are at most $\operatorname{poly}(\log n)$.
  A key technical ingredient of the proofs, which may be of independent
interest, is a result which states that over any field of characteristic zero,
up to a translation, every polynomial in a set of polynomials can be written as
a function of the polynomials in a transcendence basis of the set. We combine
this with methods based on shifted partial derivatives to obtain our final
results.

polarizations due to both dust scattering and dichroic extinction which is

spin-orbit coupling. We solve the problem analytically for a long chain of a
specific one-dimensional lattice model in the electron-hole symmetric
configuration and numerically for other cases of the same model. We present
results for the spin density of excitations in long chains with an odd number
of particles. The total spin projection along the axis of the spin-orbit
coupling $S_z= \pm 1/2$ is distributed with fractions $\pm 1/4$ localized at
both ends, and shows even-odd alternation along the sites of the chain. We
calculate the localization length of these excitations and find that it can be
well approximated by a simple analytical expression. We show that the energy
$E$ of the lowest subgap excitations of the finite chain defines tunneling and
entanglement between end states.We discuss the effect of a Zeeman coupling
$\Delta_Z$ on one of the ends of the chain only. For $\Delta_Z<E$, the energy
difference of excitations with opposite spin orientation is $\Delta_Z/2$,
consistent with a spin projection $\pm 1/4$. We argue that these physical
features are not model dependent and can be experimentally observed in TRITOPS
wires under appropriate conditions.

which has a mass ratio of $q=(3.8\pm0.7)\times10^{-4}$ and a source star that
is redder (or brighter) than the bulge main sequence. This event is located at
a low Galactic latitude in the survey area that is currently planned for NASA's
WFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey. This unusual color for a microlensed
source star implies that we cannot assume that the source star is in the
Galactic bulge. The favored interpretation is that the source star is a lower
main sequence star at a distance of $D_S=4.9\pm1.3\,$kpc in the Galactic disk.
However, the source could also be a turn-off star on the far side of the bulge
or a sub-giant in the far side of the Galactic disk if it experiences
significantly more reddening than the bulge red clump stars. However, these
possibilities have only a small effect on our mass estimates for the host star
and planet. We find host star and planet masses of $M_{\rm host}
=0.15^{+0.27}_{-0.10}M_\odot$ and $m_p=18^{+34}_{-12}M_\oplus$ from a Bayesian
analysis with a standard Galactic model under the assumption that the planet
hosting probability does not depend on the host mass or distance. However, if
we attempt to measure the host and planet masses with host star brightness
measurements from high angular resolution follow-up imaging, the implied masses
will be sensitive to the host star distance. The WFIRST exoplanet microlensing
survey is expected to use this method to determine the masses for many of the
planetary systems that it discovers, so this issue has important design
implications for the WFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey.

framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum
entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify
a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and
identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly,
QRTs revolutionize the way we think about familiar properties of physical
systems like entanglement, elevating them from just being interesting from a
fundamental point of view to being useful in performing practical tasks. The
basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states
into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of
resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free
quantum operations arising from natural restrictions on physical systems, and
that consists of all the physical processes allowed by the resource theory and
which acts invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what
information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations.
Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free
operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of
resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear
quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference
frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. In this
article we review the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing
on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To
illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly
studied QRTs in the literature.

We then investigate the gap between the obtained bound and empirical
observations by using specially designed artificial data for which the optimal
diversity is known. Finally, we analyze the tightness of the bound, and show
that the bound cannot be further improved, i.e., this paper provides the
tightest possible bound for ICT methods. In addition, we demonstrate a new use
of dynamic diversification for generative image samplers, where prototypes are
incrementally collected from a stream of artificial images generated by an
image sampler.

technological processes, but it is challenging to investigate experimentally
because of the small time (ns) and short length scales (nm) involved. On the
other hand, conventional molecular simulations struggle to cope with the
relatively long timescale required for critical ice nuclei to form. One way to
tackle this issue is to take advantage of free energy or path sampling
techniques. Unfortunately, these are computationally costly. Seeded molecular
dynamics is a much less demanding alternative that has been successfully
applied already to study the homogeneous freezing of water. However, in the
case of heterogeneous ice nucleation, nature's favourite route to form ice, an
array of suitable interfaces between the ice seeds and the substrate of
interest has to be built - and this is no trivial task. In this paper, we
present a Heterogeneous SEEDing approach (HSEED) which harnesses a random
structure search framework to tackle the ice-substrate challenge, thus enabling
seeded molecular dynamics simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation on
crystalline surfaces. We validate the HSEED framework by investigating the
nucleation of ice on: (i) model crystalline surfaces, using the coarse-grained
mW model; and (ii) cholesterol crystals, employing the fully atomistic
TIP4P/Ice water model. We show that the HSEED technique yields results in
excellent agreement with both metadynamics and forward flux sampling
simulations. Because of its computational efficiency, the HSEED method allows
one to rapidly assess the ice nucleation ability of whole libraries of
crystalline substrates - a long-awaited computational development in e.g.
atmospheric science.

some standard techniques from perturbation theory we are able to obtain the

excellent over a wide range of values of the clustering coefficient,
transmission rate and average degree of the network. Interestingly, we find
that the analytical form of $R_0$ depends on the choice of closure,

impossible for the event of interest to occur. For example, cardiovascular
disease death is a competing event for prostate cancer death because an
individual cannot die of prostate cancer once he has died of cardiovascular
disease. Various statistical estimands have been defined as possible targets of
inference in the classical competing risks literature. Many reviews have
described these statistical estimands and their estimating procedures with
recommendations about their use. However, this previous work has not used a
formal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying
conditions, which makes it difficult to interpret effect estimates and assess
recommendations regarding analytic choices. Here we use a counterfactual
framework to explicitly define each of these classical estimands. We clarify
that, depending on whether competing events are defined as censoring events,
contrasts of risks can define a total effect of the treatment on the event of
interest, or a direct effect of the treatment on the event of interest not
mediated through the competing event. In contrast, regardless of whether
competing events are defined as censoring events, counterfactual hazard
contrasts cannot generally be interpreted as causal effects. We illustrate how
identifying assumptions for all of these counterfactual estimands can be
represented in causal diagrams in which competing events are depicted as
time-varying covariates. We present an application of these ideas to data from
a randomized trial designed to estimate the effect of estrogen therapy on
prostate cancer mortality.

propose so called null space networks and introduce the concept of
M-regularization. Combined with a standard regularization method as
reconstruction layer, the proposed deep null space learning approach is shown
to be a M-regularization method; convergence rates are also derived. The
proposed null space network structure naturally preserves data consistency

Gradient Descent (SGD) on massively parallel computing resources such as GPUs.
Increasing mini-batch size is a simple and direct way to utilize the parallel
computing capacity. For small batch an increase in batch size results in the
proportional reduction in the training time, a phenomenon known as linear
scaling. However, increasing batch size beyond a certain value leads to no
further improvement in training time. In this paper we develop the first
analytical framework that extends linear scaling to match the parallel
computing capacity of a resource. The framework is designed for a class of
classical kernel machines. It automatically modifies a standard kernel machine
to output a mathematically equivalent prediction function, yet allowing for
extended linear scaling, i.e., higher effective parallelization and faster
training time on given hardware.
  The resulting algorithms are accurate, principled and very fast. For example,
using a single Titan Xp GPU, training on ImageNet with $1.3\times 10^6$ data
points and $1000$ labels takes under an hour, while smaller datasets, such as
MNIST, take seconds. As the parameters are chosen analytically, based on the
theoretical bounds, little tuning beyond selecting the kernel and the kernel
parameter is needed, further facilitating the practical use of these methods.

diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) approximation efficiently solve the
self-consistent field equations by rather drastic approximations. The
computational efficiency comes at the cost of an error in the electron-electron
repulsion integrals. The error may be compensated by the introduction of
parametric expressions to evaluate the electron-electron repulsion integrals,
the one-electron integrals, and the core-core repulsion. We review the
resulting formalisms of popular NDDO-SEMO models (such as the MNDO(/d), AM1,
PMx, and OMx models) in a concise and self-contained manner. We discuss the
approaches to implicitly and explicitly describe electron correlation effects
within NDDO-SEMO models and we dissect strengths and weaknesses of the
different approaches in a detailed analysis. For this purpose, we consider the
results of recent benchmark studies. Furthermore, we apply bootstrapping to
perform a sensitivity analysis for a selection of parameters in the MNDO model.
We also identify systematic limitations of NDDO-SEMO models by drawing on an
analogy to Kohn--Sham density functional theory.

control policies for high-dimensional systems, but its relatively poor sample
complexity often forces training in simulated environments. Even in simulation,
goal-directed tasks whose natural reward function is sparse remain intractable
for state-of-the-art model-free algorithms for continuous control. The
bottleneck in these tasks is the prohibitive amount of exploration required to
obtain a learning signal from the initial state of the system. In this work, we
leverage physical priors in the form of an approximate system dynamics model to
design a curriculum scheme for a model-free policy optimization algorithm. Our
Backward Reachability Curriculum (BaRC) begins policy training from states that
require a small number of actions to accomplish the task, and expands the
initial state distribution backwards in a dynamically-consistent manner once
the policy optimization algorithm demonstrates sufficient performance. BaRC is
general, in that it can accelerate training of any model-free RL algorithm on a
broad class of goal-directed continuous control MDPs. Its curriculum strategy
is physically intuitive, easy-to-tune, and allows incorporating physical priors
to accelerate training without hindering the performance, flexibility, and
applicability of the model-free RL algorithm. We evaluate our approach on two
representative dynamic robotic learning problems and find substantial
performance improvement relative to previous curriculum generation techniques

be implemented in micro-scale are explored for the mote. With the aim of
increasing reliability and accuracy of measurements through mass deployment of
biomotes, suitable low-power media access control (MAC) schemes are proposed,
and the feasibility of their implementation in micro-scale is highlighted.
Next, assuming that the human body is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel, the performance of the mote is simulated and analyzed. Results of this
analysis asserts that a communication range of at least few centimeters is
achievable with an acceptable bit error rate. Finally, from the analysis of the

atomless. The initial state distribution is considered to be fixed. We show
that for discounted MDPs with bounded one-step reward vector-functions, for
each policy there exists a deterministic (that is, nonrandomized and
stationary) policy with the same performance vector. This fact is proved in the
paper for a more general class of uniformly absorbing MDPs with expected total

rewards. For problems with multiple criteria and constraints, the results of
this paper imply that for atomless MDPs studied in this paper it is sufficient
to consider only deterministic policies, while without the atomless assumption
it is well-known that randomized policies can outperform deterministic ones. We
also provide an example of an MDP demonstrating that, if a vector measure is

required for spin-orbit torque to execute deterministic switching in

torque switching current to realize ultralow power is still remaining. Thus, a

The threshold current density of spin-transfer torque switching is reduced to

problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information.
Although the presence of multiple modalities provides additional valuable
information, there are two key challenges to address when learning from
multimodal data: 1) models must learn the complex intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions for prediction and 2) models must be robust to unexpected missing
or noisy modalities during testing. In this paper, we propose to optimize for a
joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels. We
introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent
factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors.
Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain
joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment
prediction. Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality
and contain the information required for generating data. Experimental results
show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that
achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets.
Our model demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on
independent factors and can reconstruct missing modalities without
significantly impacting performance. Lastly, we interpret our factorized
representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal
learning.

use the results of the Riemannian kernel on SPD matrices as similarities of

characterizes how the unlabelled data contributes to the estimation accuracy.
Moreover, the limiting distribution for the proposed estimator is established

deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices.
On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively ""vulnerable"" facing
malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and
smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT
and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and
prototype an edge-IoT framework named ""EdgeChain"" based on blockchain and smart
contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the
internal currency or ""coin"" system to link the edge cloud resource pool with
each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT
devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control
how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on
pre-defined rules on priority, application types and past behaviors. Smart
contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device
behavior in a non-deniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and
transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing.
We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits
of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain
is within a reasonable and acceptable range.

freely typed text-based KDA methods had difficulty incorporating the key
sequence information and handling variable lengths of keystrokes, which in turn
resulted in lower authentication performance compared to KDA methods based on
short and fixed-length text. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
recurrent neural network (RNN)-based KDA model. As the RNN model can process an
arbitrary length of input and target sequences, our proposed model takes two
consecutive keys as the input sequence and actual typing time for the
corresponding key sequence as the target sequence. Based on experimental
results involving 120 participants, our proposed RNN-KDA model yielded the best
authentication performance for all training and test length combinations in
terms of equal error rate (EER). It achieved a 5%-6% EER using only 10 test
keystrokes while the EERs of other benchmark methods were above 20%. In
addition, its performance steadily and more rapidly improves compared to the
benchmark methods when the length of training keystrokes increases.

customization and the advantage of this approach over the existing methods are
presented below: (1) The patterns in the data series of a hydrological variable

mapping from an input image in the source domain to an output image in the
target domain. It has been applied to numerous domains, such as data
augmentation, domain adaptation, and unsupervised training. When paired
training data is not accessible, image translation becomes an ill-posed
problem. We constrain the problem with the assumption that the translated image
needs to be perceptually similar to the original image and also appears to be
drawn from the new domain, and propose a simple yet effective image translation
model consisting of a single generator trained with a self-regularization term
and an adversarial term. We further notice that existing image translation
techniques are agnostic to the subjects of interest and often introduce
unwanted changes or artifacts to the input. Thus we propose to add an attention
module to predict an attention map to guide the image translation process. The
module learns to attend to key parts of the image while keeping everything else
unaltered, essentially avoiding undesired artifacts or changes. The predicted
attention map also opens door to applications such as unsupervised segmentation
and saliency detection. Extensive experiments and evaluations show that our
model while being simpler, achieves significantly better performance than

subordinate categories that belong to the same entry-level object category. The
task is challenging due to the facts that (1) training images with ground-truth
labels are difficult to obtain, and (2) variations among different subordinate
categories are subtle. It is well established that characterizing features of
different subordinate categories are located on local parts of object
instances. In fact, careful part annotations are available in many fine-grained
categorization datasets. However, manually annotating object parts requires
expertise, which is also difficult to generalize to new fine-grained
categorization tasks. In this work, we propose a Weakly Supervised Part
Detection Network (PartNet) that is able to detect discriminative local parts
for use of fine-grained categorization. A vanilla PartNet builds on top of a
base subnetwork two parallel streams of upper network layers, which
respectively compute scores of classification probabilities (over subordinate
categories) and detection probabilities (over a specified number of
discriminative part detectors) for local regions of interest (RoIs). The
image-level prediction is obtained by aggregating element-wise products of
these region-level probabilities. To generate a diverse set of RoIs as inputs
of PartNet, we propose a simple Discretized Part Proposals module (DPP) that
directly targets for proposing candidates of discriminative local parts, with
no bridging via object-level proposals. Experiments on the benchmark
CUB-200-2011 and Oxford Flower 102 datasets show the efficacy of our proposed
method for both discriminative part detection and fine-grained categorization.
In particular, we achieve the new state-of-the-art performance on CUB-200-2011

recommending solutions of a SPARQL query, including approximate solutions when
exact querying solutions are not available due to incompleteness or
inconsistencies of real-world RDF data. Within this framework, embedding is
applied to score solutions together with edit distance so that we could obtain
more fine-grained recommendations than those recommendations via edit distance.
For instance, graphs of two querying solutions with a similar structure can be
distinguished in our proposed framework while the edit distance depending on
structural difference becomes unable. To this end, we propose a novel score

similarity between an approximate subgraph matching and a whole graph matching.
Finally, we evaluate our approach on large RDF datasets DBpedia and YAGO, and

that at $10$ K, such species should be fully frozen out on grain surfaces. A
physical or chemical mechanism that results in a net transfer from solid-state
species into the gas phase offers a possible explanation. Reactive desorption,
i.e., desorption following the exothermic formation of a species, is one of the
options that has been proposed. In astronomical models, the fraction of
molecules desorbed through this process is handled as a free parameter, as
experimental studies quantifying the impact of exothermicity on desorption
efficiencies are largely lacking. In this work, we present a detailed
laboratory study with the goal of deriving an upper limit for the reactive
desorption efficiency of species involved in the CO-H$_2$CO-CH$_3$OH
solid-state hydrogenation reaction chain. The limit for the overall reactive
desorption fraction is derived by precisely investigating the solid-state
elemental carbon budget, using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and
the calibrated solid-state band-strength values for CO, H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH.
We find that for temperatures in the range of $10$ to $14$ K, an upper limit of
$0.24\pm 0.02$ for the overall elemental carbon loss upon CO conversion into
CH$_3$OH. This corresponds with an effective reaction desorption fraction of
$\leq$$0.07$ per hydrogenation step, or $\leq$$0.02$ per H-atom induced
reaction, assuming that H-atom addition and abstraction reactions equally
contribute to the overall reactive desorption fraction along the hydrogenation
sequence. The astronomical relevance of this finding is discussed.

breaking in a two-dimensional pendulum. In our experiment we have used two
modes of a single oscillator to demonstrate normal modes, as opposed to two
single oscillators used in standard setups of two-dimensional pendulums.
Breaking of the cylindrical symmetry of the pendulum is achieved by attaching a
spring in the suspension. This leads to interesting visual patterns in the
motion, wherein the plane of the oscillator shifts with time, the motion then
becomes elliptical, shifts back again to planar, before finally returning to
planar motion in the original plane. The symmetry breaking leads to
non-degenerate normal modes of oscillation, whose interplay gives rise to the
observed motion patterns. This also explains why for a real pendulum, the plane
of motion always shifts, unlike the ideal two-dimensional pendulum where the
plane of oscillation is supposed to remain fixed. This curious fact also
contributes to the difficulties involved in building a Foucault's pendulum,
where the plane of rotation due to Coriolis force needs to be accurately
measured. The strength of the symmetry breaking in our system can be quantified
by a parameter the ""return time"", which is defined as the time over which the
pendulum returns to its original motion pattern. We propose this setup as a
pedagogical tool to introduce the concepts of normal modes and symmetry
breaking in a physics laboratory. The motion patterns that emerge have a high
visual impact and we have also described in detail the quantitative
observations can be made with this setup.

procedure has the merit that any existing control method that has been
developed in Euclidean space can be applied globally to systems defined on
nonlinear manifolds, thus making nonlinear controller design on manifolds
easier. The detail of the method is demonstrated on the fully actuated rigid
body system.

explained by scattered light only. In LDN1780 H2 fluorescent emission in the
wavelength range 1400A-1700A has been detected and analysed. Our albedo values
agree with the predictions of the dust model of Weingartner and Draine and with
the THEMIS CMM model for evolved core-mantle grains. The H2 fluorescent
emission in LDN1780 shows a pronounced dichotomy with a preference for its
southern side where enhanced illumination impinges from the Sco OB2 association

no manually annotated data is available, we train a network to predict DSC
scores from estimated quality obtained via a reverse testing strategy. We
report an MAE=0.14 and 91% binary classification accuracy for this case.
Predictions are obtained in real-time which, when combined with real-time

  ~ -1/12",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A scaling and renormalization approach to the Riemann zeta function, $\zeta$,
evaluated at $-1$ is presented in two ways. In the first, one takes the
difference between
  $U_{n}:=\sum_{q=1}^{n}q$ and $4U_{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor }$
where $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor $ is the greatest integer
function. Using the Cesaro mean twice, i.e., $\left( C,2\right) $, yields
convergence to the appropriate value. For values of $z$ for which the zeta
function is represented by a convergent infinite sum, the double Cesaro mean
also yields $\zeta\left( z\right) ,$ suggesting that this could be used as an
alternative method for extension from the convergent region of $z.$ In the
second approach, the difference $U_{n}-k^{2}\bar{U}_{n/k}$ between $U_{n}$ and
a particular average, $\bar{U}_{n/k}$, involving terms up to $k<n$ and scaled
by $k^{2}$ is shown to equal exactly $-\frac{1}{12}\left( 1-k^{2}\right) $ for
all $k<n$. This leads to another perspective for interpreting $\zeta\left(

statistically higher than other Type Ib/c SNe. A statistically significant

The total energy of the systems is typically smaller than the maximum available

Formalism, we perform a classical analysis on the possible static solutions

order to study EC paradigm in a FRW background. Our model contains a kinetic
term of the scalar field minimally coupled to the background geometry without a
potential term. The matter content of the model consists of a perfect fluid
plus a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a separate source. In the framework
of a local dynamical system analysis, we show that in the absence or presence
of $\Lambda$, depending on some adopted values for the free parameters of the
underlying cosmological model with flat and non-flat spatial geometries, one
gets some static solutions which are viable under classical linear
perturbations. By extending our study to a global dynamical system analysis, we
show that in the presence of $\Lambda$ with non-flat spatial geometries there
is a future global de Sitter attractor in this model. Following the second
method, we derive a new static solution that represents a stable ESU but this

created using a LI-RADS template, it was also able to infer LI-RADS scoring for
unstructured reports that were created before the LI-RADS guidelines were
established. No human-labelled data was required in any step of this study; for
training, LI-RADS scores were automatically extracted from those reports that
contained structured LI-RADS scores, and it translated the derived knowledge to
reasoning on unstructured radiology reports. By providing automated LI-RADS
categorization, our approach may enable standardizing screening recommendations
and treatment planning of patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and it
may facilitate AI-based healthcare research with US images by offering large
scale text mining and data gathering opportunities from standard hospital
clinical data repositories.

manipulate conditions of the virtual environment on the fly, while the gameplay
camera is set to automatically retrace a predetermined 6DOF camera pose
trajectory within the game coordinate system. Concurrently, automatic screen
capture is executed while the virtual environment is being explored. G2D and
its source code are publicly available at https://goo.gl/SS7fS6

this research program, a previous theory of gravitation based on a mechanical
model of vacuum and a sink flow model of particles is generalized by methods of
special relativistic continuum mechanics. In inertial coordinate systems, we
construct a tensorial potential which satisfies the wave equations. Inspired by
the equations of motion of a test particle, a definition of a metric tensor of
a Riemannian spacetime is introduced. Applying Fock's theorem, generalized
Einstein's equations in inertial systems are derived based on some assumptions.
These equations reduce to Einstein's equations in case of weak field in
harmonic coordinate systems.

self-affine or self similar nature of growing surfaces was investigated by
autocorrelation function and obtained results are compared with the
morphological envelope method. Theoretical estimations revealed that the global
surface parameters such as, interface width and lateral correlation length are
monotonically decreased with increasing film thickness. Also, from height
profile and A-F plots, it has been perceived that irregularity/ complexity of
growing layers was significantly influenced by thickness. On the other hand,
the fractal dimension and local roughness exponent, estimated by height-height
correlation function, do not suggest such dependency.

locally conserved. This implies local conservation of probability for the Dirac
and Klein-Gordon wavefunctions, as special cases; and then in turn for
non-relativistic quantum field theory and for the Schroedinger and
Ginzburg-Landau equations, regarded as low energy limits. Quantum mechanics,
however, is wider than quantum field theory, as an effective model of reality.
For instance, fractional quantum mechanics and Schroedinger equations with
non-local terms have been successfully employed in several applications. The
non-locality of these formalisms is strictly related to the problem of time in
quantum mechanics. We compute explicitly for continuum wave packets the terms
of the fractional Schroedinger equation and of the non-local Schroedinger
equation by Lenzi et al. which break the local current conservation, and
discuss their physical significance. The results are especially relevant for
the electromagnetic coupling of these wavefunctions. A connection with the
non-local Gorkov equation for superconductors and their proximity effect is
also outlined.

device by proposing several mathematical models and by pursuing their
mathematical and numerical analysis. The first model measures the effect on
nucleation of calcite of the electric potential near the surface of a ceramic
sphere in natural water. The second model is based on a crystal lattice model
and argues that the surface tension energy of the calcite particles is reduced
by the polarization energy brought by the ceramic balls. The third model is
macroscopic and numerical and studies the effect of two ceramic balls
arrangements in a flow of water containing calcite particles.

flexibility in the design of random walk and impose new conditions on the walk
to avoid (or transit) a specific node (or a set of nodes) before the stopping
criteria. These theories help with applications that cannot be modeled by
classical Markov chains and require more flexibility and intricacy in their
modeling. Specifically, we use them for the pivotality ranking of the nodes in
a network reachabilities. More often than not, it is not sufficient simply to
know whether a source node $s$ can reach a target node $t$ in the network and
additional information associated with reachability, such as how long or how
many possible ways node $s$ may take to reach node $t$, is required. In this
paper, we analyze the pivotality of the nodes which capture how pivotal a role
that a node $k$ or a subset of nodes $S$ may play in the reachability from node
$s$ to node $t$ in a given network. Through some synthetic and real-world
network examples, we show that these metrics build a powerful ranking tool for
the nodes based on their pivotality in the reachability.
