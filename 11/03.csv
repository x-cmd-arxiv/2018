A fundamental tool for calculating and managing risks in finance and insurance

classical martingale representations to non-monotone information generated by
marked point processes. The central idea is to focus only on those properties
that martingales and compensators show on infinitesimally short intervals.
While classical martingale representations describe innovations only, our

observe an increase of the out-of-plane lattice constants of the LaAlO$_3$

low-temperature sheet resistance increases with increasing growth pressure,
leading to an insulating interface when the growth pressure reaches 0.10 mbar.
We attribute the structural variations to an increase of the La/Al ratio, which
also explains the transition from metallic behavior to insulating behavior of

also the control which is furnished by the Ar pressure in the growth process.

allow testing of different massive star formation theories. It also enables us
to assess quantitatively the impact of outflow feedback on protostellar core

away most of the envelope, thereby nearly ending its own accretion. We thus
find an overall star formation efficiency of $\sim50\%$, similar to that
expected from low-mass protostellar cores. Our simulation results therefore
indicate that the MHD disk wind outflow is the dominant feedback mechanism for
helping to shape the stellar initial mass function from a given prestellar core

multigraph so as to minimize the maximum weighted in-degree. Since the
introduction of the problem the best algorithm known achieves an approximation
ratio of $1.75$ and it is based on rounding a linear program with this exact
integrality gap. It is also known that there is no $(1.5 -
\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$. Can we do
better than $1.75$? We prove that a different LP formulation, the configuration
LP, has a strictly smaller integrality gap. Graph Balancing was the last one in
a group of related problems from literature, for which it was open whether the
configuration LP is stronger than previous, simple LP relaxations. We base our
proof on a local search approach that has been applied successfully to the more
general Restricted Assignment problem, which in turn is a prominent special
case of makespan minimization on unrelated machines. With a number of technical
novelties we are able to obtain a bound of $1.749$ for the case of Graph
Balancing. It is not clear whether the local search algorithm we present
terminates in polynomial time, which means that the bound is non-constructive.
However, it is a strong evidence that a better approximation algorithm is
possible using the configuration LP and it allows the optimum to be estimated
within a factor better than $1.75$. A particularly interesting aspect of our
techniques is the way we handle small edges in the local search. We manage to
exploit the configuration constraints enforced on small edges in the LP. This
may be of interest to other problems such as Restricted Assignment as well.

However, due to the special subcarrier allocation model of IEEE 802.11ax, the
utility maximization problem involving the instantaneous rates of stations can
be formulated as an assignment problem, and hence can be solved using the
Hungarian method. In this paper, we address the more general problem of
stochastic network utility maximization. Specifically, we maximize the utility
of long-term average rates of stations subject to average rate and power
constraints using Lyapunov optimization. The resulting resource allocation
policies perform arbitrarily close to optimal and have polynomial time
complexity. An important advantage of the proposed framework is that it can be
used along with the target wake time mechanism of IEEE 802.11ax to provide
guarantees on the average power consumption and/or achievable rates of stations
whenever possible. Two key applications of such a design approach are
power-constrained IoT networks and battery-powered sensor networks. We
complement the theoretical study with computer simulations that evaluate our

formulation can be explained as a basis pursuit denoising problem, wherein the
data matrix (or measurement matrix) is employed as the denoising matrix to
eliminate the observation noise. However, we notice that the data matrix may
not be the optimal denoising matrix, as shown by a simple counter-example. This
motivates us to pursue a better denoising matrix for defining a general DS
formulation. We first define the optimal denoising matrix through a minimax
optimization, which turns out to be an NPhard problem. To make the problem
computationally tractable, we propose a novel algorithm, termed as Optimal
Denoising Dantzig Selector (ODDS), to approximately estimate the optimal
denoising matrix. Empirical experiments validate the proposed method. Finally,
a novel sparse reinforcement learning algorithm is formulated by extending the
proposed ODDS algorithm to temporal difference learning, and empirical
experimental results demonstrate to outperform the conventional vanilla DS-TD

has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its

data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the infinitesimal
generator of the Koopman operator. We further establish a connection between
the Koopman framework, conserved quantities, and the Lie-Poisson bracket. This
data-driven method for discovering conserved quantities is demonstrated on the
three-dimensional rigid body equations, where we simultaneously discover the
total energy and angular momentum and use these intrinsic coordinates to

Considering the inhomogeneous or heterogeneous background, we have demonstrated
that if the background and the half-immersed object are both non-absorbing, the
transferred photon momentum to the object can be considered as the one of
Minkowski exactly at the interface. In contrast, the presence of loss inside

is wide open and includes some long-standing open questions, such as the
complexity of approximate graph colouring, as special cases.
  The basic algebraic approach to PCSP was initiated by Brakensiek and
Guruswami, and in this paper we significantly extend it and lift it from
concrete properties of polymorphisms to their abstract properties. We introduce
a new class of problems that can be viewed as algebraic versions of the (Gap)
Label Cover problem, and show that every PCSP with a fixed constraint language
is equivalent to a problem of this form. This allows us to identify a ""measure
of symmetry"" that is well suited for comparing and relating the complexity of
different PCSPs via the algebraic approach. We demonstrate how our theory can
be applied by improving the state-of-the-art in approximate graph colouring: we
show that, for any $k\geq 3$, it is NP-hard to find a $(2k-1)$-colouring of a
given $k$-colourable graph.

methodologies for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver
under the constraint of one-bit complex quantization. Single bit quantization
greatly reduces complexity and power consumption, but makes accurate channel
estimation and data detection difficult. This is particularly true for
multicarrier waveforms, which have high peak-to-average ratio in the time
domain and fragile subcarrier orthogonality in the frequency domain. The severe
distortion for one-bit quantization typically results in an error floor even at
moderately low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) such as 5 dB. For channel estimation
(using pilots), we design a novel generative supervised deep neural network
(DNN) that can be trained with a reasonable number of pilots. After channel
estimation, a neural network-based receiver -- specifically, an autoencoder --
jointly learns a precoder and decoder for data symbol detection. Since
quantization prevents end-to-end training, we propose a two-step sequential
training policy for this model. With synthetic data, our deep learning-based
channel estimation can outperform least squares (LS) channel estimation for
unquantized (full-resolution) OFDM at average SNRs up to 14 dB. For data
detection, our proposed design achieves lower bit error rate (BER) in fading
than unquantized OFDM at average SNRs up to 10 dB.

Oversampling for improved learning from class imbalanced datasets. The
essential idea behind the proposed method is to use the distance between a
minority class sample and its respective cluster centroid to infer the number
of new sample points to be generated for that minority class sample. The
proposed algorithm has very less dependence on the technique used for finding
cluster centroids and does not effect the majority class learning in any way.
It also improves learning from imbalanced data by incorporating the
distribution structure of minority class samples in generation of new data
samples. The newly generated minority class data is handled in a way as to
prevent outlier production and overfitting. Implementation analysis on
different datasets using deep neural networks as the learning classifier shows
the effectiveness of this method as compared to other synthetic data resampling
techniques across several evaluation metrics.

structures, defined by their morphology and decoupled kinematics. We call these
structures ""molecular tori"", even though they appear often as disks, without
holes in the center. They have varied orientations, unaligned with their host

100~pc scale resonant rings, that play the role of a reservoir to fuel the

providing evidence for feeding processes. Most frequently, the torus and the
AGN are slightly off-centered, with respect to the bar-resonant ring position,
implying that the black hole is wandering by a few 10~pc amplitude around the
center of mass of the galaxy. Our spatial resolution allows us to measure gas
velocities inside the sphere of influence of the central black holes. By
fitting the observations with different simulated cubes, varying the torus
inclination and the black hole mass, it is possible to estimate the mass of the
central black hole, which is in general difficult for such late-type galaxies,

engineering workflows. The large-scale nature of the experiments they model and
their variable workloads make clouds the ideal execution environment due to
prompt and elastic access to huge amounts of computing resources. Autoscalers
are middleware-level software components that allow scaling up and down the
computing platform by acquiring or terminating virtual machines (VM) at the
time that workflow's tasks are being scheduled. In this work we propose a novel
online multi-objective autoscaler for workflows denominated Cloud
Multi-objective Intelligence (CMI), that aims at the minimization of makespan,
monetary cost and the potential impact of errors derived from unreliable VMs.
In addition, this problem is subject to monetary budget constraints. CMI is
responsible for periodically solving the autoscaling problems encountered along
the execution of a workflow. Simulation experiments on four well-known
workflows exhibit that CMI significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art
autoscaler of similar characteristics called Spot Instances Aware Autoscaling
(SIAA). These results convey a solid base for deepening in the study of other
meta-heuristic methods for autoscaling workflow applications using cheap but
unreliable infrastructures.

satisfaction problems (CSPs) has flourished across several disciplines,
including computer science, mathematics and physics. The diversity of the
developed methods, on the rigorous and non-rigorous side, has led to major
advances regarding both the theoretical as well as the applied viewpoints.
Based on a ceteris paribus approach in terms of the density evolution equations
known from statistical physics, we focus on a specific prominent class of
regular CSPs, the so-called occupation problems. The regular $r$-in-$k$
occupation problems resemble a basis of this class. By now, out of these CSPs
only the satisfiability threshold - the largest degree for which the problem
admits asymptotically a solution - for the $1$-in-$k$ occupation problem has
been rigorously established. Here we determine the satisfiability threshold of
the $2$-in-$k$ occupation problem for all $k$. In the proof we exploit the
connection of an associated optimization problem regarding the overlap of
satisfying assignements to a fixed point problem inspired by belief
propagation, a message passing algorithm developed for solving such CSPs.

heterostructures with stable excitonic resonances up to room temperature. In
this work strong light-matter coupling in 2D perovskite single-crystal flakes

systems, e.g. plasmonic nanocavities, in which the direction of the field is
usually orthogonal to the material sheet. Organic interlayers are shown to
affect also the strong birefringence associated to the layered structure, which

gauge-theory duals of these solutions are confining four-dimensional field
theories. Their UV completions consist of the compactification on a circle of a
higher-dimensional field theory that is flowing between two fixed points in
five dimensions. We systematically study the bosonic fluctuations of the
supergravity theory, corresponding to the bosonic glueballs of the dual field
theory.
  We perform numerically the calculation of the spectrum of excitations of all
the bosonic fields, several of which had been disregarded in earlier work on
the subject. We discuss the results as a function of the one parameter
characterising the class of background solutions, hence further extending known
results. We show how certain towers of states are independent of the
background, and compare these states to existing lattice literature on
four-dimensional Yang-Mills (pure) gauge theories, confirming the existence of
close similarities.

dominated at large T by a state whose energy grows linearly as $\sigma R$, with

catastrophic failure of Li metal batteries. However, the chemical component and
the atomic level structure of inactive Li have rarely been studied due to the
lack of effective diagnosis tools to accurately differentiate and quantify Li+
in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) components and the electrically isolated
unreacted metallic Li0, which together comprise the inactive Li. Here, by
introducing a new analytical method, Titration Gas Chromatography (TGC), we can
accurately quantify the contribution from metallic Li0 to the total amount of
inactive Li. We uncover that the Li0, rather than the electrochemically formed
SEI, dominates the inactive Li and capacity loss. Using cryogenic electron
microscopies to further study the microstructure and nanostructure of inactive
Li, we find that the Li0 is surrounded by insulating SEI, losing the electronic
conductive pathway to the bulk electrode. Coupling the measurements of the Li0
global content to observations of its local atomic structure, we reveal the
formation mechanism of inactive Li in different types of electrolytes, and
identify the true underlying cause of low Coulombic efficiency in Li metal

overview of research relative to future directions in HCI Education, distinct
crossings of science fiction in HCI and Computer Science teaching and the
Framework for 21st Century Learning. Next, we provide examples where science
fiction can add to the future of HCI Education. In particular, we argue herein
first that science fiction, as tangible and intangible cultural artifact, can
serve as a trigger for creativity and innovation and thus, support us in
exploring the design space. Second, science fiction, as a means to analyze
yet-to-come HCI technologies, can assist us in developing an open-minded and
reflective dialogue about technological futures, thus creating a singular base
for critical thinking and problem solving. Provided that one is cognizant of
its potential and limitations, we reason that science fiction can be a
meaningful extension of selected aspects of HCI curricula and research.

waveforms and ventricular functions are in good qualitative and quantitative

exhibit the typical I, J, K, L, M and N peaks and show good qualitative and
quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. Simulated BCG signals
associated with reduced contractility and increased stiffness of the left

Adaptive estimation provides a way of selecting tuning parameters for
statistical estimators using only the available data. This allows us to perform
estimation without making strong assumptions about the estimand. In contrast to
procedures such as training and validation, the Goldenshluger-Lepski method
uses all of the data to produce non-adaptive estimators for a range of values
of the tuning parameters. An adaptive estimator is selected by performing
pairwise comparisons between these non-adaptive estimators. Applying the
Goldenshluger-Lepski method is non-trivial as it requires a simultaneous

regression context, we choose our non-adaptive estimators to be clipped

fact that we cannot use the $L^2$ norm for performing the pairwise comparisons

Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder Decoder (THRED), a novel, fully data-driven,
multi-turn response generation system intended to produce contextual and
topic-aware responses. Our model is built upon the basic Seq2Seq model by
augmenting it with a hierarchical joint attention mechanism that incorporates
topical concepts and previous interactions into the response generation. To
train our model, we provide a clean and high-quality conversational dataset
mined from Reddit comments. We evaluate THRED on two novel automated metrics,
dubbed Semantic Similarity and Response Echo Index, as well as with human
evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is able to
generate more diverse and contextually relevant responses compared to the
strong baselines.

When the supporting substrate is changed from SiO2 to Al2O3 or SrTiO3, the rate
constant for second-order exciton-exciton annihilation, k_XX [cm2/s], is
reduced by one or two orders of magnitude, respectively. Using transient
photoluminescence microscopy, we measure the effective room-temperature exciton

corresponding to a diffusion length of LD = 350 nm for an exciton lifetime of
{\tau} = 20 ns, which is independent of the substrate. These results, together
with numerical simulations, suggest that the effective exciton-exciton
annihilation radius monotonically decreases with increasing refractive index of
the underlying substrate. Exciton-exciton annihilation limits the overall
efficiency of 2D semiconductor devices operating at high exciton densities; the

these results hold regardless of the exact form of the thermal effects. This
explains how SNSPDs have inherent photon-number resolving capability. We
experimentally verify the photon number dependence by collecting waveforms for
different photon number, rescaling them according to our predicted relation,
and performing statistical analysis that shows that there is no statistical
significance between the rescaled curves. Additionally, we use our predicted
dependence of rise time on detector length to provide further insight to
previous theoretical work by other authors. By assuming a specific thermal

present a conformal printing method to achieve functional graphene-based

print single and multi-layered electrically functional structures on to a

on water, allowing the dissolution of the sacrificial layer, while retaining
the functional patterns. The single and multilayer patterns can then be
directly transferred on to arbitrarily-shaped 3D objects without requiring any
post deposition processing. Using this technique, we demonstrate conformal
printing of single and multilayer functional devices that include joule
heaters, resistive strain sensors and proximity sensors on hard, flexible and
soft substrates, such as glass, latex, thermoplastics, textiles, and even
candies and marshmallows. Our simple strategy offers great promises to add new

method reveals that in contrast to PCA-based approaches, RSVP is able to cope
well with settings where the smallest eigenvalue of $\Gamma^T \Gamma$ is close
to the largest eigenvalue of $\Sigma$, as well as settings where the
eigenvalues of $\Gamma^T \Gamma$ are diverging fast. It is also able to handle
data that may have heavy tails and only requires that the data has an
elliptical distribution. RSVP does not require knowledge or estimation of the
number of latent factors $q$, but only recovers $\Sigma$ up to an unknown
positive scale factor. We argue this suffices in many applications, for example
if an estimate of the correlation matrix is desired. We also show that by using
subsampling, we can further improve the performance of the method. We
demonstrate the favourable performance of RSVP through simulation experiments

goods (CPG) company. We have found that while the company appreciates the
advantages of dynamic pricing, they deem it operationally much easier to plan
out a static price calendar in advance.
  We investigate the efficacy of static control policies for revenue management
problems whose optimal solution is inherently dynamic. In these problems, a
firm has limited inventory to sell over a finite time horizon, over which
heterogeneous customers stochastically arrive. We consider both pricing and
assortment controls, and derive simple static policies in the form of a price
calendar or a planned sequence of assortments, respectively. In the assortment
planning problem, we also differentiate between the static vs. dynamic
substitution models of customer demand. We show that our policies are within
1-1/e (approximately 0.63) of the optimum under stationary (IID) demand, and
1/2 of the optimum under non-stationary demand, with both guarantees
approaching 1 if the starting inventories are large.
  We adapt the technique of prophet inequalities from optimal stopping theory
to pricing and assortment problems, and our results are relative to the linear
programming relaxation. Under the special case of IID single-item pricing, our
results improve the understanding of irregular and discrete demand curves, by
showing that a static calendar can be (1-1/e)-approximate if the prices are

population of dust grains, i.e., a range of grain sizes is considered. Due to
inertia, large grains (typical radius $a \gtrsim 1.0\,\mu$m) will decouple from
the gas flow, while small grains ($a\lesssim 0.1\,\mu$m) will tend to better
trace the motions of the gas. We note that simulations with purely solenoidal
forcing show somewhat more pronounced decoupling and less clustering compared
to simulations with purely compressive forcing. Overall, small and large grains
tend to cluster, while intermediate-size grains show essentially a random
isotropic distribution. As a consequence of increased clustering, the
grain-grain interaction rate is locally elevated; but since small and large
grains are often not spatially correlated, it is unclear what effect this

considered in the presence of fading channels with time of arrival
measurements. When narrowband signals are used for localization, due to
existing hardware constraints, fading channels play a crucial role in
localization accuracy. In a location estimation formulation, the Cramer-Rao
lower bound for localization error is derived under different assumptions on
fading coefficients. For the same level of localization accuracy, the loss in
performance due to Rayleigh fading with known phase is shown to be about 5dB
compared to the case with no fading. Unknown phase causes an additional 1dB
loss. The maximum likelihood estimators are also derived.
  In an alternative distributed detection formulation, each anchor receives a
noisy signal from a node with known location if the node is active. Each anchor
makes a decision as to whether the node is active or not and transmits a bit to
a fusion center once a decision is made. The fusion center combines all the
decisions and uses a design parameter to make the final decision. We derive
optimal thresholds and calculate the probabilities of false alarm and detection
under different assumptions on the knowledge of channel information.
Simulations corroborate our analytical results.

backward reachable set is a set of states, from which all trajectories starting
will surely enter a target region at the end of a given time horizon without
violating a set of state constraints in spite of the actions of uncertainties.
It is equal to the zero sub-level set of the unique Lipschitz viscosity
solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (HJE). We show that
inner-approximations of the backward reachable set can be formed by zero
sub-level sets of its viscosity super-solutions. Consequently, we reduce the
inner-approximation problem to a problem of synthesizing polynomial viscosity
super-solutions to this HJE. Such a polynomial solution in our method is
synthesized by solving a single semi-definite program. We also prove that
polynomial solutions to the formulated semi-definite program exist and can
produce a convergent sequence of inner-approximations to the interior of the
backward reachable set in measure under appropriate assumptions. This is the
main contribution of this work. Several illustrative examples demonstrate the
merits of our approach.

for the presence of this feature in the data that is very much analogous to
tests of General Relativity with radio-observations of binary pulsars. We then
go one step further and specialize this test to scalar-tensor theories to

electrons propagating from the sun along the Parker-spiral magnetic field lines
are progressively focused into a narrow strahl at heliospheric distances
$r\lesssim 1$ AU, while at $r\gtrsim 1$ AU the width of the strahl saturates
due to Coulomb collisions and becomes independent of the distance. Our theory
of the strahl broadening does not contain free parameters and it agrees with
the Wind observations at 1 AU to within $15-20\%$. This indicates that Coulomb
scattering, rather than anomalous turbulent diffusion, plays a dominant role in
strahl formation in these observations. We further propose that the nearly
isotropic halo electron population may be composed of electrons that ran away
from the sun as an electron strahl, but later ended up on magnetic field lines
leading them back to the sun. Through the effects of magnetic defocusing and
Coulomb pitch-angle scattering, a narrow source distribution at large
heliocentric distances appears nearly isotropic at distances $\sim$1 AU. The
halo electrons are, therefore, not produced locally; rather, they are the fast
electrons trapped by magnetic field lines on global heliospheric scales. At the
electron energies $K \lesssim 200\,\, {\rm eV}$, our theory is quite
insensitive to the particular mechanism that produces a population of
sunward-streaming suprathermal particles. At larger energies, however, our
theory indicates that the scattering provided by Coulomb collisions alone is
not sufficient to isotropize a narrow sunward-propagating electron beam.

maximum difference between the number of red and blue vertices in any set in
the system. In 2011, Newman and Nikolov disproved a conjecture of Beck that the
discrepancy of any $3$-permutation family is at most a constant independent of
$n$. Here we give a simpler proof that Newman and Nikolov's sequence of
$3$-permutation families has discrepancy $\Omega(\log n)$. We also exhibit a
sequence of $6$-permutation families with root-mean-squared discrepancy
$\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$; that is, in any red-blue vertex coloring, the square
root of the expected difference between the number of red and blue vertices in
an interval of the system is $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$.

the results of the renormalization group in combination with a memory-function

Accelerated QBX (`GIGAQBX') and target-specific expansions. GIGAQBX is a fast
high-order scheme for evaluation of layer potentials based on Quadrature by
Expansion (`QBX') using local expansions formed via the Fast Multipole Method
(FMM). Target-specific expansions serve to lower the cost of the formation and
evaluation of QBX local expansions, reducing the associated computational
effort from $O((p+1)^{2})$ to $O(p+1)$ in three dimensions, without any
accuracy loss compared with conventional expansions, but with the loss of
source/target separation in the expansion coefficients. GIGAQBX is a `global'
QBX scheme, meaning that the potential is mediated entirely through expansions
for points close to or on the boundary. In our scheme, this single global
expansion is decomposed into two parts that are evaluated separately: one part
incorporating near-field contributions using target-specific expansions, and
one part using conventional spherical harmonic expansions of far-field
contributions, noting that convergence guarantees only exist for the sum of the
two sub-expansions. By contrast, target-specific expansions were originally
introduced as an acceleration mechanism for `local' QBX schemes, in which the
far-field does not contribute to the QBX expansion. Compared with the
unmodified GIGAQBX algorithm, we show through a reproducible, time-calibrated
cost model that the combined scheme yields a considerable cost reduction for
the near-field evaluation part of the computation. We support the effectiveness
of our scheme through numerical results demonstrating performance improvements

we improve on previous work by giving a reconstruction algorithm that

distance-based technique provably outputs the model tree when the model tree
has $O(\text{poly} \log n)$ diameter and discretized branch lengths, allowing
for the probability of insertion and deletion to be non-uniform and asymmetric

multi-slice MRI datasets acquired with two different coils in eleven subjects
(healthy volunteers and patients). The validation included a comparison with
the alternative state-of-the-art CNN methods for the segmentation of joints
from MR images and the ground-truth manual segmentation. When trained on the
limited training data, the CNN outperformed significantly image-based and
patch-based U-Net networks. Our PB-CNN also demonstrated a good agreement with
manual segmentation (Sorensen-Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 0.81) in the
representative (central coronal) slices with large amount of cartilage tissue.
Reduced performance of the network for slices with a very limited amount of
cartilage tissue suggests the need for fully 3D convolutional networks to
provide uniform performance across the joint. The study also assessed inter-
and intra-observer variability of the manual wrist cartilage segmentation
(DSC=0.78-0.88 and 0.9, respectively). The proposed deep-learning-based
segmentation of the wrist cartilage from MRI could facilitate research of novel
imaging markers of wrist osteoarthritis to characterize its progression and
response to therapy.

unitarity of time evolution and the S-matrix, are famously rigid and robust,
admitting no obvious consistent theoretical deformations, and confirmed to
incredible accuracy by experiments. But neither of these notions seem to appear
directly in describing the spatial correlation functions at future infinity
characterizing the ""boundary"" observables in cosmology. How then can we see
them emerge as {\it exact} concepts from a possible ab-initio theory for the
late-time wavefunction of the universe? In this letter we examine this question
in a simple but concrete setting, for the perturbative wavefunction in a class
of scalar field models where an ab-initio description of the wavefunction has
been given by ""cosmological polytopes"". Singularities of the wavefunction are
associated with facets of the polytope. One of the singularities --
corresponding to the ""total energy pole"" -- is well known to be associated with
the flat-space scattering amplitude. We show how the combinatorics and geometry
of this {\it scattering facet} of the cosmological polytope straightforwardly
leads to the emergence of Lorentz invariance and unitarity for the S-matrix.
Unitarity follows from the way boundaries of the scattering facet factorize
into products of lower-dimensional polytopes, while Lorentz invariance follows
from a contour integral representation of the canonical form, which exists for
any polytope, specialized to cosmological polytopes.

primordial fluctuations has received much attention. The abundance of PBHs
formed during radiation domination is sensitive to the tail of the probability
distribution of primordial fluctuations. We quantify the level of fine-tuning
due to this sensitivity. For example, if the main source of dark matter is PBHs
with mass $10^{-12}M_\odot$, then anthropic reasoning suggests that the dark
matter to baryon ratio should range between 1 and 300. For this to happen, the
root-mean-square amplitude of the curvature perturbation has to be fine-tuned
within a $7.1\%$ range. As another example, if the recently detected
gravitational-wave events are to be explained by PBHs, the corresponding degree
of fine-tuning is $3.8\%$. We also find, however, that these fine-tunings can
be relaxed if the primordial fluctuations are highly non-Gaussian, or if the
PBHs are formed during an early-matter-dominated phase. We also note that no
fine-tuning is needed for the scenario of a reheating of the universe by
evaporated PBHs with Planck-mass relics left to serve as dark matter.

application of powerful optimisation tools such as variational inference to RL.
However, existing inference frameworks and their algorithms pose significant
challenges for learning optimal policies, e.g., the absence of mode capturing
behaviour in pseudo-likelihood methods and difficulties learning deterministic
policies in maximum entropy RL based approaches. We propose VIREL, a novel,
theoretically grounded probabilistic inference framework for RL that utilises a
parametrised action-value function to summarise future dynamics of the
underlying MDP. This gives VIREL a mode-seeking form of KL divergence, the
ability to learn deterministic optimal polices naturally from inference and the
ability to optimise value functions and policies in separate, iterative steps.
In applying variational expectation-maximisation to VIREL we thus show that the
actor-critic algorithm can be reduced to expectation-maximisation, with policy
improvement equivalent to an E-step and policy evaluation to an M-step. We then
derive a family of actor-critic methods from VIREL, including a scheme for
adaptive exploration. Finally, we demonstrate that actor-critic algorithms from
this family outperform state-of-the-art methods based on soft value functions

is introduced.The beamforming algorithm is designed to be robust to some error
in the estimate of the target speaker direction. The algorithm has two main
components: a robust target linearly constrained minimum variance (TLCMV)
algorithm based on imposing two constraints around the estimated direction of
the target signal, and a post-processor to help with the preservation of
binaural cues. The robust TLCMV provides a good level of noise reduction and
low level of target distortion under realistic conditions. The post-processor
enhances the beamformer abilities to preserve the binaural cues for both
diffuse-like background noise and directional interferers (competing speakers),
while keeping a good level of noise reduction. The introduced algorithm does
not require knowledge or estimation of the directional interferers' directions
nor the second-order statistics of noise-only components. The introduced
algorithm requires an estimate of the target speaker direction, but it is
designed to be robust to some deviation from the estimated direction. Compared
with recently proposed state-of-the-art methods, comprehensive evaluations are
performed under complex realistic acoustic scenarios generated in both anechoic
and mildly reverberant environments, considering a mismatch between estimated
and true sources direction of arrival. Mismatch between the anechoic
propagation models used for the design of the beamformers and the mildly
reverberant propagation models used to generate the simulated directional
signals is also considered. The results illustrate the robustness of the
proposed algorithm to such mismatches.

investigation of current and future research directions. We structure our
discussion around three of these directions, which we believe are likely to
lead to significant progress. The first encompasses a spectrum of approaches to
verification and admission control, which is a prerequisite to enable fail-safe
defaults in machine learning systems. The second seeks to design mechanisms for
assembling reliable records of compromise that would help understand the degree
to which vulnerabilities are exploited by adversaries, as well as favor
psychological acceptability of machine learning applications. The third pursues
formal frameworks for security and privacy in machine learning, which we argue
should strive to align machine learning goals such as generalization with
security and privacy desiderata like robustness or privacy. Key insights
resulting from these three directions pursued both in the ML and security
communities are identified and the effectiveness of approaches are related to
structural elements of ML algorithms and the data used to train them. We
conclude by systematizing best practices in our community.

advantage of its unprecedented weak lensing capabilities, we reveal a
remarkably tight connection between the stellar mass distribution of massive
central galaxies and their host dark matter halo mass. Massive galaxies with
more extended stellar mass distributions tend to live in more massive dark
matter haloes. We explain this connection with a phenomenological model that
assumes, (1) a tight relation between the halo mass and the total stellar
content in the halo, (2) that the fraction of in-situ and ex-situ mass at
$r<10$ kpc depends on halo mass. This model provides an excellent description
of the stellar mass functions (SMF) of total stellar mass ($M_{\star}^{\rm
Max}$) and stellar mass within inner 10 kpc ($M_{\star}^{10}$) and also
reproduces the HSC weak lensing signals of massive galaxies with different
stellar mass distributions. The best-fit model shows that halo mass varies
significantly at fixed total stellar mass (as much as 0.4 dex) with a clear
dependence on $M_{\star}^{10}$. Our two-parameter $M_{\star}^{\rm
Max}$-$M_{\star}^{10}$ description provides a more accurate picture of the
galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end than the simple stellar-halo mass
relation (SHMR) and opens a new window to connect the assembly history of halos
with those of central galaxies. The model also predicts that the ex-situ

approximately 15 minutes, where 86 and 283 pulses were detected above a
signal-to-noise threshold of 6 with the MWA and UTMOST, respectively. Of the
detected pulses, 51 had counterparts at both frequencies and exhibited steep
spectral indices for both the bright main pulse component and the precursor
component. We find that the bright state pulse energy distribution is best
parameterised by a log-normal distribution at both frequencies, contrary to
previous results which suggested a power law distribution. Further
low-frequency observations are required in order to explore in detail aspects
such as pulse-to-pulse variability, intensity modulations and to better
constrain the signal propagation effects due to the interstellar medium and
intermittency characteristics at these frequencies. The spectral index,
extended profile emission covering a large fraction of pulse longitude, and the
broadband intermittency of PSR J1107-5907 suggests that future low-frequency
pulsar searches, for instance those planned with SKA-Low, will be in an
excellent position to find and investigate new pulsars of this type.

this multitask learning method, the pitch information can be leveraged to

correlated bad-metal, which undergoes a metal-insulator transition (MIT)
concomitant with a structural transition to a V-V dimerized monoclinic phase
below T$_{MIT} \sim 340K$. It has been experimentally shown that one can
control this transition by doping VO$_2$. In particular, doping with oxygen
vacancies ($V_O$) has been shown to completely suppress this MIT {\em without}
any structural transition. We explain this suppression by elucidating the
influence of oxygen-vacancies on the electronic-structure of the metallic $R$
phase VO$_2$, explicitly treating strong electron-electron correlations using
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) as well as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
flavor of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques. We show that $V_O$'s tend to
change the V-3$d$ filling away from its nominal half-filled value, with the
$e_{g}^{\pi}$ orbitals competing with the otherwise dominant $a_{1g}$ orbital.
Loss of this near orbital polarization of the $a_{1g}$ orbital is associated
with a weakening of electron correlations, especially along the V-V
dimerization direction. This removes a charge-density wave (CDW) instability
along this direction above a critical doping concentration, which further
suppresses the metal-insulator transition. Our study also suggests that the MIT
is predominantly driven by a correlation-induced CDW instability along the V-V
dimerization direction.

deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as temporary base stations (BSs)
to complement ground cellular systems in face of downlink traffic overload.
First, a novel learning approach, based on the weighted expectation
maximization (WEM) algorithm, is proposed to estimate the user distribution and
the downlink traffic demand. Next, to guarantee a truthful information exchange
between the BS and UAVs, using the framework of contract theory, an offload
contract is developed, and the sufficient and necessary conditions for having a
feasible contract are analytically derived. Subsequently, an optimization
problem is formulated to deploy an optimal UAV onto the hotspot area in a way
that the utility of the overloaded BS is maximized. Simulation results show
that the proposed WEM approach yields a prediction error of around 10%.
Compared with the expectation maximization and k-mean approaches, the WEM
method shows a significant advantage on the prediction accuracy, as the traffic
load in the cellular system becomes spatially uneven. Furthermore, compared
with two event-driven deployment schemes based on the closest-distance and
maximal-energy metrics, the proposed predictive approach enables UAV operators
to provide efficient communication service for hotspot users in terms of the
downlink capacity, energy consumption and service delay. Simulation results
also show that the proposed method significantly improves the revenues of both
the BS and UAV networks, compared with two baseline schemes.

literature in order to improve the scalability while retaining desirable
prediction accuracy. This paper devotes to investigating the methodological
characteristics and performance of representative global and local scalable GPs
including sparse approximations and local aggregations from four main
perspectives: scalability, capability, controllability and robustness. The
numerical experiments on two toy examples and five real-world datasets with up
to 250K points offer the following findings. In terms of scalability, most of
the scalable GPs own a time complexity that is linear to the training size. In
terms of capability, the sparse approximations capture the long-term spatial
correlations, the local aggregations capture the local patterns but suffer from
over-fitting in some scenarios. In terms of controllability, we could improve
the performance of sparse approximations by simply increasing the inducing
size. But this is not the case for local aggregations. In terms of robustness,
local aggregations are robust to various initializations of hyperparameters due
to the local attention mechanism. Finally, we highlight that the proper hybrid

contain any path of order $k$. When $k = 2$, this turns out to be the classic
vertex cover ({\sc VC}) problem, which admits a $\left(2 - {\rm
\Theta}\left(\frac 1{\log|V|}\right)\right)$-approximation. The general {\sc
P$k$VC} admits a trivial $k$-approximation; when $k = 3$ and $k = 4$, the best
known approximation results for {\sc P$3$VC} and {\sc P$4$VC} are a
$2$-approximation and a $3$-approximation, respectively. On $d$-regular graphs,
the approximation ratios can be reduced to $\min\left\{2 - \frac 5{d+3} +
\epsilon, 2 - \frac {(2 - o(1))\log\log d}{\log d}\right\}$ for {\sc VC} ({\it
i.e.}, {\sc P$2$VC}), $2 - \frac 1d + \frac {4d - 2}{3d |V|}$ for {\sc P$3$VC},
$\frac {\lfloor d/2\rfloor (2d - 2)}{(\lfloor d/2\rfloor + 1) (d - 2)}$ for
{\sc P$4$VC}, and $\frac {2d - k + 2}{d - k + 2}$ for {\sc P$k$VC} when $1 \le
k-2 < d \le 2(k-2)$. By utilizing an existing algorithm for graph defective
coloring, we first present a $\frac {\lfloor d/2\rfloor (2d - k + 2)}{(\lfloor
d/2\rfloor + 1) (d - k + 2)}$-approximation for {\sc P$k$VC} on $d$-regular
graphs when $1 \le k - 2 < d$. This beats all the best known approximation
results for {\sc P$k$VC} on $d$-regular graphs for $k \ge 3$, except for {\sc
P$4$VC} it ties with the best prior work and in particular they tie at $2$ on
cubic graphs and $4$-regular graphs. We then propose a $1.875$-approximation
and a $1.852$-approximation for {\sc P$4$VC} on cubic graphs and $4$-regular
graphs, respectively. We also present a better approximation algorithm for {\sc
P$4$VC} on $d$-regular bipartite graphs.

model, wherein apart from immobile ions no further approximations are made. The
effect of the laser pulse amplitude, pulse duration, and plasma density is
studied using the fluid model and compared with the expected scaling laws and
also with the PIC simulations. The agreement between the fluid model and the

conversion from the electromagnetic field energy to the longitudinal
electrostatic fields results in the dispersion and so the red-shift of the pump
laser pulse. We also studied the interaction of the dispersed pulse (after the
propagation in underdense plasma) with the sub-wavelength two-layer composite

is absent along the zigzag direction. This phenomenon is consistent with
experimental observations. The angle-resolved optical absorption in few-layer

  vaccination impact during an Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Eastern
  region of the Democratic Republic of Congo",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As of October 12, 2018, 211 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported
in North Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of
October the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed
conflict is occurring, and in which EVD cases and their contacts are difficult
for health workers to reach. We modeled EVD transmission using a branching
process with gradually quenching transmission estimated from past EVD
outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course
of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We
used an autoregression for short-term projections, a regression model for final
sizes, and a simple Gott's law rule as an ensemble of forecasts. Short-term
model projections were validated against actual case counts. During validation
of short-term projections, models consistently scored higher on shorter-term
forecasts. Based on case counts as of October 13, the stochastic model
projected a median case count of 226 by October 27 (95% prediction interval:
205-268) and 245 by November 10 (95% PI: 208-315), while the auto-regression
model projected median case counts of 240 (95% PI: 215-307) and 259 (95% PI:
216-395) for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range
from 274 to 421. Except for Gott's law, the projected probability of an
outbreak surpassing 2013-2016 is exceedingly small. The stochastic model
estimates that vaccine coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its
trial. Based on our projections we believe that the epidemic had not yet peaked
at the time of these estimates, though an outbreak like 2013-2016 is not
likely. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than under target levels
of vaccine coverage, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator
for the outbreak response challenges.

partial-connected HAD beamforming can significantly reduce the hardware cost,
complexity, and power consumption. In this paper, in order to mitigate the
jamming along with lowering the hardware complexity and cost by reducing the
number of RF chains needed, a novel hybrid analog and digital receive
beamformer based on an improved bat algorithm (I-BA) and the phase-only is
proposed. Our proposed beamformer is compared with robust adaptive beamformers

part. The evolutionary optimization algorithm is proposed since most of the RAB
methods are sensitive to the DOA mismatch, and depending on the complex
weights, resulting in an expensive receiver. In the analog part, analog phase
alignment by linear searching (APALS) with a sufficiently fine grid of points
is employed to optimize the analog beamformer matrix. The performance of the
proposed I-BA is revealed using MATLAB simulation and compared with BA, and
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, which shows a better performance
in terms of convergence speed, stability, and the ability to jump from the
local minima.

idea is to study the expected performance on small perturbations of the worst

perturbation and the input size. We consider four different models of
perturbation. We show that the expected number of bits to describe optimal
guard positions per guard is logarithmic in the input and the magnitude of the

Electroweak symmetry breaking is realized via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism in
a classically scale invariant theory, while the neutrino mass is generated
radiatively through interactions with dark matter in a typically scotogenic
manner. The model introduces a scalar triplet and singlet and a vector-like
fermion doublet that carry an odd parity of $Z_2$, and an even parity scalar
singlet that helps preserve classical scale invariance. We sample over the
parameter space by taking into account various experimental constraints from
the dark matter relic density and direct detection, direct scalar searches,
neutrino mass, and charged lepton flavor violating decays. We then examine by
detailed simulations possible signatures at the LHC to find some benchmark
points of the free parameters. We find that the future high-luminosity LHC will

more knowledge is needed about the Macdonald polynomials than is usually

we summarize the relevant facts and open problems about the Macdonald and, more
generally, Kerov functions. Like Macdonald polynomials, they are triangular
combinations of Schur functions, but orthogonal in a more general scalar

through the Schur functions of these variables as well. Despite they provide an
infinite-parametric extension of the Schur and Macdonald polynomials, the Kerov
functions, and even the skew Kerov functions continue to satisfy the most
important relations, like Cauchy summation formula, the transposition identity
for reflection of the Young diagram and expression of the skew functions
through the generalized Littlewood-Richardson structure constants. Since {\it

the Kerov extension exists for most of them, from the superintegrable matrix

dynamics of biomolecules. However, the use of harmonic potentials renders this
model insufficient for studying large conformational changes of proteins (e.g.
stretching of proteins, folding and thermal unfolding). Here, we extend the
capabilities of the EN model by using a harmonic approximation described by
Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions for far contacts and native contacts obtained
from the standard overlap criterion as in the case of Go-like models. While our
model is validated against the EN model by reproducing the equilibrium
properties for a number of proteins, we also show that the model is suitable
for the study of large conformation changes by providing various examples. In
particular, this is illustrated on the basis of pulling simulations that
predict with high accuracy the experimental data on the rupture force of the
studied proteins. Furthermore, in the case of DDFLN4 protein, our pulling
simulations highlight the advantages of our model with respect to Go-like
approaches, where the latter fail to reproduce previous results obtained by
all-atom simulations that predict an additional characteristic peak for this
protein. In addition, folding simulations of small peptides yield different
folding times for alpha-helix and beta-hairpin, in agreement with experiment,
in this way providing further opportunities for the application of our model in
studying large conformational changes of proteins. In contrast to the EN model,
our model is suitable for both normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics
simulation. We anticipate that the proposed model will find applications in a
broad range of problems in biology, including, among others, protein folding

with a large spread in the observed projected rotations. In addition to
rotation, internal age variation is indicated as a possible responsible for the
eMSTOs, making these systems the possible young counterparts of globular

eMSTO+broadened MSs are not a peculiarity of MCs clusters. Similar photometric
features have been discovered in a few Galactic open clusters, challenging the
idea that the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these systems are similar to
single isochrones and opening new windows to explore the eMSTO phenomenon. We

similarly to MCs clusters; (iii) the eMSTO, if interpreted as a pure age
spread, increases with age, following the relation observed in MCs clusters and
demonstrating that rotation is the responsible for this phenomenon.

positive semidefinite matrix (denoted as $Z$), which encounters semidefinite
program (SDP). Existing SDP solvers by classical convex optimization are
expensive to solve large-scale problems. Employing the low rank of solution,
Burer-Monteiro's method reformulated SDP as a nonconvex problem via the
$quadratic$ factorization ($Z$ as $XX^\top$). However, this would lose the
structure of problem in optimization. In this paper, we propose to convert SDP
into a biconvex problem via the $bilinear$ factorization ($Z$ as $XY^\top$),
and while adding the term $\frac{\gamma}{2}||X-Y||_F^2$ to penalize the
difference of $X$ and $Y$. Thus, the biconvex structure (w.r.t. $X$ and $Y$)
can be exploited naturally in optimization. As a theoretical result, we provide
a bound to the penalty parameter $\gamma$ under the assumption of $L$-Lipschitz
smoothness and $\sigma $-strongly biconvexity, such that, at stationary points,
the proposed bilinear factorization is equivalent to Burer-Monteiro's
factorization when the bound is arrived, that is
$\gamma>\frac{1}{4}(L-\sigma)_+$. Our proposal opens up a new way to surrogate
SDP by biconvex program. Experiments on two SDP-related applications
demonstrate that the proposed method is effective as the state-of-the-art.

role in the diagnosis of some diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. In
this paper, we propose Deformable U-Net (DUNet), which exploits the retinal
vessels' local features with a U-shape architecture, in an end to end manner
for retinal vessel segmentation. Inspired by the recently introduced deformable
convolutional networks, we integrate the deformable convolution into the
proposed network. The DUNet, with upsampling operators to increase the output
resolution, is designed to extract context information and enable precise
localization by combining low-level feature maps with high-level ones.
Furthermore, DUNet captures the retinal vessels at various shapes and scales by
adaptively adjusting the receptive fields according to vessels' scales and
shapes. Three public datasets DRIVE, STARE and CHASE_DB1 are used to train and
test our model. Detailed comparisons between the proposed network and the
deformable neural network, U-Net are provided in our study. Results show that
more detailed vessels are extracted by DUNet and it exhibits state-of-the-art
performance for retinal vessel segmentation with a global accuracy of
0.9697/0.9722/0.9724 and AUC of 0.9856/0.9868/0.9863 on DRIVE, STARE and
CHASE_DB1 respectively. Moreover, to show the generalization ability of the
DUNet, we used another two retinal vessel data sets, one is named WIDE and the
other is a synthetic data set with diverse styles, named SYNTHE, to
qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and compared with other methods.
Results indicates that DUNet outperforms other state-of-the-arts.

semantics behind different types of paths in the network and during the
process, it may use unreliable paths that are inconsistent with the general
idea of similarity in neighborhood collaborative ranking. That negligence
undermines the reliability of the recommendation list generated by GRank. This
paper seeks to present a novel framework for reliable graph-based collaborative
ranking, called ReGRank, that ranks items based on reliable recommendation
paths that are in harmony with the semantics behind different approaches in
neighborhood collaborative ranking. To our knowledge, ReGRank is the first
unified framework for neighborhood collaborative ranking that in addition to
traditional user-based collaborative ranking, can also be adapted for
preference-based and representative-based collaborative ranking as well.
Experimental results show that ReGRank significantly improves the state-of-the

properties of the Lasso estimator to that of a simple soft-thresholding
denoiser,in a denoising problem in which the parameters $(\theta_i)_{i\le N}$
are observed in Gaussian noise, with a carefully tuned variance. Earlier work
confirmed this picture in the limit $n,N\to\infty$, pointwise in the parameters
$\theta$, and in the value of the regularization parameter.
  Here, we consider a standard random design model and prove exponential
concentration of its empirical distribution around the prediction provided by
the Gaussian denoising model. Crucially, our results are uniform with respect
to $\theta$ belonging to $\ell_q$ balls, $q\in [0,1]$, and with respect to the
regularization parameter. This allows to derive sharp results for the
performances of various data-driven procedures to tune the regularization.
  Our proofs make use of Gaussian comparison inequalities, and in particular of
a version of Gordon's minimax theorem developed by Thrampoulidis, Oymak, and
Hassibi, which controls the optimum value of the Lasso optimization problem.
Crucially, we prove a stability property of the minimizer in Wasserstein

no more than $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{p+1}{p-q+1}})$ evaluations of the objective
function and its derivatives to compute a suitably approximate $q$-th order
minimizer. With an appropriate choice of the regularization, a similar result
also holds if the $p$-th derivative is merely H\""older rather than Lipschitz
continuous. We provide an example that shows that the above complexity bound is
sharp for unconstrained and a wide class of constrained problems, we also give
reasons for the optimality of regularization methods from a worst-case
complexity point of view, within a large class of algorithms that use the same
derivative information.

notable in handling the range query and update operations. A Segment Tree
divides the range into disjoint segments and merges them together to perform
range queries and range updates elegantly. Although this data structure is
remarkably potent for 1-dimensional problems, it falls short in higher
dimensions. Lazy Propagation enables the operations to be computed in $O(logn)$

the non-eruptive filament favours the growth and reconnection of overlying

reason is that it is comprised of three successive stages of reconnection. A

allow us to identify the loops involved in the reconnection process and build a
reliable scenario for this atypical confined flare. The main result is that a

paper, we propose \textit{deep ad-hoc beamforming}, a deep-learning-based

address the problem. It contains three novel components. First, it combines
\textit{ad-hoc microphone arrays} with deep-learning-based multichannel speech
enhancement, which reduces the probability of the occurrence of far-field
acoustic environments significantly. Second, it groups the microphones around
the speech source to a local microphone array by a supervised channel selection
framework based on deep neural networks. Third, it develops a simple time
synchronization framework to synchronize the channels that have different time
delay. Besides the above novelties and advantages, the proposed model is also
trained in a single-channel fashion, so that it can easily employ new
development of speech processing techniques. Its test stage is also flexible in
incorporating any number of microphones without retraining or modifying the
framework. We have developed many implementations of the proposed framework and
conducted an extensive experiment in scenarios where the locations of the
speech sources are far-field, random, and blind to the microphones. Results on
speech enhancement tasks show that our method outperforms its counterpart that
works with linear microphone arrays by a considerable margin in both diffuse
noise reverberant environments and point source noise reverberant environments.
We have also tested the framework with different handcrafted features. Results
show that although designing good features lead to high performance, they do
not affect the conclusion on the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

describing massive numbers of agents with limited computational power. A
population protocol ""has an initial leader"" if every valid initial
configuration contains a single agent in a special ""leader"" state that helps to
coordinate the computation. Although the class of predicates and functions
computable with probability 1 is the same whether or not there is an initial
leader (semilinear functions and predicates), it is not known whether a leader
is necessary for fast computation. Efficient population protocols are generally
defined as those computing in polylogarithmic in $n$ (parallel) time. We
consider leaderless population protocols, regarding the computation finished
when a configuration is reached from which a different output is no longer
reachable.
  In this setting we show that a wide class of functions and predicates
computable by population protocols are not efficiently computable (they require
at least linear time to stabilize on a correct answer), nor are some linear
functions even efficiently approximable. For example, the widely studied
parity, majority, and equality predicates cannot be computed in sublinear time.
Moreover, it requires at least linear time for a population protocol even to
approximate any linear function with a coefficient outside of $\mathbb{N}$: for
sufficiently small $\gamma > 0$, the output of a sublinear time protocol can
stabilize outside the interval $f(m) (1 \pm \gamma)$ on infinitely many inputs
$m$. We also show that it requires linear time to exactly compute a wide range
of semilinear functions (e.g., $f(m)=m$ if $m$ is even and $2m$ if $m$ is odd).
  Finally, we show that with a sufficiently large value of $\gamma$, a
population protocol can approximate any linear $f$ with nonnegative rational
coefficients, within approximation factor $\gamma$, in $O(\log n)$ time.

both challenging and realistic. We show that various coreference systems,
whether rule-based, feature-rich, or neural, perform significantly worse on the

performance gap, we show empirically that state-of-the art models often fail to
capture context, instead relying on the gender or number of candidate
antecedents to make a decision. We then use problem-specific insights to
propose a data-augmentation trick called antecedent switching to alleviate this
tendency in models. Finally, we show that antecedent switching yields promising
results on other tasks as well: we use it to achieve state-of-the-art results

induce an additional quantum-curvature (QC) term in the energy-momentum tensor
of fluid using the generalized framework of the stochastic variational method
(SVM). The QC term is necessary to satisfy the momentum conservation but the
corresponding quantum hydrodynamics is not necessarily cast into the form of
the Schr\""{o}dinger equation, differently from the case of the Euclidean
spacetime. This seems to suggest that the existence of the Hilbert space is not
a priori requirement in the quantization of curved spacetime systems. As an
example, we apply the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and show that
this effect contributes to the cosmological acceleration although it is too
small in the present non-relativistic toy model.

elasticity with weak stress symmetry on quadrilateral grids, which can be
reduced to a symmetric and positive definite cell centered system. The method
is developed on simplicial grids in [4]. The method utilizes the lowest order
Brezzi-Douglas-Marini finite element spaces for the stress and the trapezoidal
quadrature rule in order to localize the interaction of degrees of freedom,
which allows for local stress elimination around each vertex. We develop two
variants of the method. The first uses a piecewise constant rotation and
results in a cell-centered system for displacement and rotation. The second
uses a continuous piecewise bilinear rotation and trapezoidal quadrature rule
for the asymmetry bilinear form. This allows for further elimination of the
rotation, resulting in a cell-centered system for the displacement only.
Stability and error analysis is performed for both methods. First-order
convergence is established for all variables in their natural norms. A duality
argument is employed to prove second order superconvergence of the displacement
at the cell centers. Numerical results are presented in confirmation of the
theory.

things and cyber-physical system applications such as smart home and
intelligent video surveillance. In a smart home, various sensors are deployed
to monitor the home environment and physiological health of individuals. The
data collected by sensors are sent to an application, where numerous algorithms
for emotion and sentiment detection, activity recognition and situation
management are applied to provide healthcare- and emergency-related services
and to manage resources at the home. The executions of these algorithms require
a vast amount of computing and storage resources. To address the issue, the
conventional approach is to send the collected data to an application on an
internet cloud. This approach has several problems such as high communication
latency, communication energy consumption and unnecessary data traffic to the
core network. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional cloud-based
approach, a new system called mobile edge cloud is proposed. In mobile edge
cloud, multiple mobiles and stationary devices interconnected through wireless
local area networks are combined to create a small cloud infrastructure at a
local physical area such as a home. Compared to traditional mobile distributed
computing systems, mobile edge cloud introduces several complex challenges due
to the heterogeneous computing environment, heterogeneous and dynamic network
environment, node mobility, and limited battery power. The real-time
requirements associated with the internet of things and cyber-physical system
applications make the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we describe
the applications and challenges associated with the design and development of
mobile edge cloud system and propose an architecture based on a cross layer
design approach for effective decision making.

  Spectral Variability","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1803.06355",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional hyperspectral unmixing methods neglect the underlying variability
of spectral signatures often observed in typical hyperspectral images (HI),
propagating these missmodeling errors throughout the whole unmixing process.
Attempts to model material spectra as members of sets or as random variables
tend to lead to severely ill-posed unmixing problems. Although parametric
models have been proposed to overcome this drawback by handling endmember
variability through generalizations of the mixing model, the success of these
techniques depend on employing appropriate regularization strategies. Moreover,
the existing approaches fail to adequately explore the natural multidimensinal
representation of HIs. Recently, tensor-based strategies considered low-rank
decompositions of hyperspectral images as an alternative to impose
low-dimensional structures on the solutions of standard and multitemporal
unmixing problems. These strategies, however, present two main drawbacks: 1)
they confine the solutions to low-rank tensors, which often cannot represent
the complexity of real-world scenarios; and 2) they lack guarantees that
endmembers and abundances will be correctly factorized in their respective
tensors. In this work, we propose a more flexible approach, called ULTRA-V,
that imposes low-rank structures through regularizations whose strictness is
controlled by scalar parameters. Simulations attest the superior accuracy of
the method when compared with state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms that account
for spectral variability.

and a complete bipartite graph with partite sets of size $a$ and $b$, denoted

the gap between list chromatic number and the chromatic number tells us
$\chi_\ell(K_{a,b}) = 1 + a$ if and only if $b \geq a^a$. Since
$\chi_\ell(K_{a,b}) \leq 1 + a$ for any $b \in \mathbb{N}$, this result tells
us the values of $b$ for which $\chi_\ell(K_{a,b})$ is as large as possible and
far from $\chi(K_{a,b})=2$. In this paper we seek to understand when
$\chi_\ell(G \square K_{a,b})$ is far from $\chi(G \square K_{a,b}) = \max
\{\chi(G), 2 \}$. It is easy to show $\chi_\ell(G \square K_{a,b}) \leq
\chi_\ell (G) + a$. In 2006, Borowiecki, Jendrol, Kr\'al, and Miskuf showed
that this bound is attainable if $b$ is sufficiently large; specifically,
$\chi_\ell(G \square K_{a,b}) = \chi_\ell (G) + a$ whenever $b \geq

analogue of the chromatic polynomial, provides the right concept and tool for
making progress on this problem. Using the list color function, we prove a

smallest such $b$ exactly for some large families of chromatic-choosable

methodology, the key objective being to minimize the expected loss function in
recovering the transmitted information. For that criterion, the optimal
decision is the Bayesian minimum-risk estimator. However, the computational
load of the Bayesian estimator is often prohibitive and, hence, efficient
computational schemes are required. The design of novel schemes, striking new
balances between accuracy and computational load, is the primary concern of
this thesis. Two popular techniques, one exact and one approximate, will be
studied.
  The exact scheme is a recursive one, namely the generalized distributive law
(GDL), whose purpose is to distribute all operators across the conditionally
independent (CI) factors of the joint model, so as to reduce the total number
of operators required. In a novel theorem derived in this thesis, GDL, if
applicable, will be shown to guarantee such a reduction in all cases. An
associated lemma also quantifies this reduction. For practical use, two novel
algorithms, namely the no-longer-needed (NLN) algorithm and the generalized
form of the Markovian Forward-Backward (FB) algorithm, recursively factorizes
and computes the CI factors of an arbitrary model, respectively.
  The approximate scheme is an iterative one, namely the Variational Bayes (VB)
approximation, whose purpose is to find the independent (i.e. zero-order
Markov) model closest to the true joint model in the minimum Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KLD) sense. Despite being computationally efficient, this naive
mean field approximation confers only modest performance for highly correlated
models. A novel approximation, namely Transformed Variational Bayes (TVB), will
be designed in the thesis in order to relax the zero-order constraint in the VB
approximation, further reducing the KLD of the optimal approximation.

magnetic moments with angular momenta $\hbar/2$. This gives rise to a ""Spin
Meissner effect"", the existence of a spin current in the ground state of
superconductors. The theory explains how a superconducting body starts spinning
when it expels magnetic fields, it provides a dynamical explanation for the
Meissner effect, and it explains how supercurrents stop without dissipation,
all of which we argue the conventional theory fails to explain. Essential
elements of the theory of hole superconductivity are that superconductivity is
driven by lowering of kinetic energy, which we have also proposed is true for
ferromagnets], that the normal state charge carriers in superconducting
materials are holes, and that the spin-orbit interaction plays a key role in
superconductivity. The theory is proposed to apply to all superconductors.

are generated by a background algorithm; that is, pseudo-random numbers. Since
late $19^{th}$ century, researchers have been working on pseudo-random number
generators (PRNGs). Several PRNGs continue to develop, each one demanding to be
better than the previous ones. In this scenario, this paper targets to verify
the claim of so-called good generators and rank the existing generators based
on strong empirical tests in same platforms. To do this, the genre of PRNGs
developed so far has been explored and classified into three groups -- linear
congruential generator based, linear feedback shift register based and cellular
automata based. From each group, well-known generators have been chosen for
empirical testing. Two types of empirical testing has been done on each PRNG --
blind statistical tests with Diehard battery of tests, TestU01 library and NIST
statistical test-suite and graphical tests (lattice test and space-time diagram
test). Finally, the selected $29$ PRNGs are divided into $24$ groups and are
ranked according to their overall performance in all empirical tests.

tissue's interface, where spatial interactions can exert strong geometric
influences on the local rate of growth. These geometric influences may be
mechanistic, or cell behavioural in nature. The control of geometry on tissue
growth has been evidenced in many in-vivo and in-vitro experiments, including
bone remodelling, wound healing, and tissue engineering scaffolds. In this
paper, we propose a generalisation of a mathematical model that captures the
mechanistic influence of curvature on the joint evolution of cell density and
tissue shape during tissue growth. This generalisation allows us to simulate
abrupt topological changes such as tissue fragmentation and tissue fusion, as
well as three dimensional cases, through a level-set-based method. The
level-set method developed introduces another Eulerian field than the level-set
function. This additional field represents the surface density of tissue
synthesising cells, anticipated at future locations of the interface. Numerical
tests performed with this level-set-based method show that numerical
conservation of cells is a good indicator of simulation accuracy, particularly
when cusps develop in the tissue's interface. We apply this new model to
several situations of curvature-controlled tissue evolutions that include
fragmentation and fusion.

Learning applications. Recently, CapsuleNets have overtaken traditional DNNs,
because of their improved generalization ability due to the multi-dimensional
capsules, in contrast to the single-dimensional neurons. Consequently,
CapsuleNets also require extremely intense matrix computations, making it a
gigantic challenge to achieve high performance. In this paper, we propose
CapsAcc, the first specialized CMOS-based hardware architecture to perform
CapsuleNets inference with high performance and energy efficiency.
State-of-the-art convolutional DNN accelerators would not work efficiently for
CapsuleNets, as their designs do not account for key operations involved in
CapsuleNets, like squashing and dynamic routing, as well as multi-dimensional
matrix processing. Our CapsAcc architecture targets this problem and achieves
significant improvements, when compared to an optimized GPU implementation. Our
architecture exploits the massive parallelism by flexibly feeding the data to a
specialized systolic array according to the operations required in different
layers. It also avoids extensive load and store operations on the on-chip
memory, by reusing the data when possible. We further optimize the routing
algorithm to reduce the computations needed at this stage. We synthesized the
complete CapsAcc architecture in a 32nm CMOS technology using Synopsys design
tools, and evaluated it for the MNIST benchmark (as also done by the original
CapsuleNet paper) to ensure consistent and fair comparisons. This work enables
highly-efficient CapsuleNets inference on embedded platforms.

though there has been significant research on this subject, no ideal protection
has been discovered to fully prevent corrosion. However, methods such as using
protective coatings, and modifying the structure or composition of the material
have been used to slow down gradual corrosion and fortunately they proved to be
quite beneficial. The research focus has shifted to integrating novel materials
and structures to improve the corrosion resistance of composites. Carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) are an attractive and promising filler due to their chemical
inertness and high mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. CNTs can
fill the gaps of metals and polymer-based composites by forming a passive layer
on metals and promoting sacrificial protection in zinc rich polymer (ZRP)
coatings, and can therefore function as an anti-corrosion filler. This paper
reviews the research that has been performed to better understand the influence
of CNTs on corrosion resistance in composites. Accordingly, in metal matrix
composites (MMCs), most of the work has been carried out on electrodeposited
coatings, namely Ni-based-CNT composites, which show improved corrosion
resistance by CNT addition. On the other hand, there are a few papers that have
studied the corrosion resistance of Mg-based-CNT composites and their corrosion
results contradict those obtained from other metal-CNT composites. For ZRPs or
polymer-based coatings there are a few papers that studied the effect of CNTs
on the corrosion of said composites. It is believed that CNTs can strengthen
the adhesion between the coating and the substrate and facilitate sacrificial
protection by Zn particles by forming a conductive network, hence the improved
corrosion resistance.
