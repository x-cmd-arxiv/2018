high-resolution multi-annual numerical simulations of Saturn's atmospheric

Saturn DYNAMICO GCM, by combining a radiative-seasonal model tailored for
Saturn to a hydrodynamical solver based on an icosahedral grid suitable for
massively-parallel architectures. The impact of numerical dissipation, and the
conservation of angular momentum, are examined in the model before a reference
simulation employing the Saturn DYNAMICO GCM with a $1/2^{\circ}$
latitude-longitude resolution is considered for analysis. Mid-latitude banded
jets showing similarity with observations are reproduced by our model. Those
jets are accelerated and maintained by eddy momentum transfers to the mean
flow, with the magnitude of momentum fluxes compliant with the observed values.
The eddy activity is not regularly distributed with time, but appears as
bursts; both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities could play a role in the
eddy activity. The steady-state latitude of occurrence of jets is controlled by
poleward migration during the spin-up of our model. At the equator, a
weakly-superrotating tropospheric jet and vertically-stacked alternating
stratospheric jets are obtained in our GCM simulations. The model produces
Yanai (Rossby-gravity), Rossby and Kelvin waves at the equator, as well as
extratropical Rossby waves, and large-scale vortices in polar regions.
Challenges remain to reproduce Saturn's powerful superrotating jet and
hexagon-shaped circumpolar jet in the troposphere, and downward-propagating
equatorial oscillation in the stratosphere.

lie along the sequence of active star formation in the M$_\star$ vs.
star-formation rate diagram, without a clear excess in the integrated SFR. The
location of galaxies along the star-formation main sequence (SFMS) does not
influence strongly the presence or not of outflows. The analysis of the
star-formation rate density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) reveals that the CALIFA
sources present higher values when compared with normal star-forming galaxies.
The strength of this relation depends on the calibrator used to estimate the
SFR. This excess in $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is significant within the first
effective radius supporting the idea that most outflows are driven by processes
in the inner regions of a galaxy. We find that the molecular gas mass density
($\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$) is a key parameter that plays an important role in the
generation of outflows through its association with the local SFR. The
canonical threshold reported for the generation of outflows -- $\Sigma_{\rm

with specific focus on the Thue-Morse geometry, we make a first step toward
extending the studies above to the middle-ground of aperiodically ordered
multilayers, lying in between perfect periodicity and disorder. We show that,
also for these geometries, there exist critical parameter ranges that favor the
buildup of boundary effects leading to strong enhancement of the (otherwise
negligibly weak) nonlocality. However, the underlying mechanisms are
fundamentally different from those observed in the periodic case, and exhibit
typical footprints (e.g., fractal gaps, quasi-localized states) that are
distinctive of aperiodic order. The outcomes of our study indicate that
aperiodic order plays a key role in the buildup of the aforementioned boundary
effects, and may also find potential applications to optical sensors, absorbers
and lasers.

mixes Hoare's Quicksort algorithm with X, where X can be chosen from a wider
range of other known sorting algorithms, like Heapsort, Insertionsort and
Mergesort. Its major advantage is that QuickXsort can be in-place even if X is
not. In this work we provide general transfer theorems expressing the number of
comparisons of QuickXsort in terms of the number of comparisons of X. More
specifically, if pivots are chosen as medians of (not too fast) growing size
samples, the average number of comparisons of QuickXsort and X differ only by
$o(n)$-terms. For median-of-$k$ pivot selection for some constant $k$, the
difference is a linear term whose coefficient we compute precisely. For
instance, median-of-three QuickMergesort uses at most $n \lg n - 0.8358n +
O(\log n)$ comparisons.
  Furthermore, we examine the possibility of sorting base cases with some other
algorithm using even less comparisons. By doing so the average-case number of
comparisons can be reduced down to $n \lg n- 1.4106n + o(n)$ for a remaining
gap of only $0.0321n$ comparisons to the known lower bound (while using only
$O(\log n)$ additional space and $O(n \log n)$ time overall).
  Implementations of these sorting strategies show that the algorithms
challenge well-established library implementations like Musser's Introsort.

admit non-Kerr black holes. While earlier estimates for the M87* black hole
mass, depending on the method used, fall in the range $ \approx 3\times 10^9

promising tool to estimate black hole parameters and to probe theories of

question arises: Is it possible by a simple technique to estimate black hole
parameters from its shadow, for arbitrary models? In this paper, we present
observables, expressed in terms of ordinary integrals, characterizing a
haphazard shadow shape to estimate the parameters associated with black holes,
and then illustrate its relevance to four different models: Kerr,
Kerr$-$Newman, and two rotating regular models. Our method is robust, accurate,
and consistent with the results obtained from existing formalism, and it is
applicable to more general shadow shapes that may not be circular due to noisy

likelihood estimation (TMLE) (or likewise, targeted minimum loss estimation)
for simultaneous estimation of multi-dimensional parameters of interest. TMLE,
as part of the targeted learning framework, offers a crucial step in
constructing efficient plug-in estimators for nonparametric or semiparametric
models. The so-called targeting step of targeted learning, involves fluctuating
the initial fit of the model in a way that maximally adjusts the plug-in
estimate per change in the log likelihood. Previously for multidimensional
parameters of interest, iterative TMLE's were constructed using locally least
favorable submodels as defined in van der Laan and Gruber, 2016, which are
indexed by a multidimensional fluctuation parameter. In this paper we define a
canonical least favorable submodel in terms of a single dimensional epsilon for
a $d$-dimensional parameter of interest. One can view the clfm as the iterative
analog to the one-step TMLE as constructed in van der Laan and Gruber, 2016. It
is currently implemented in several software packages we provide in the last
section. Using a single epsilon for the targeting step in TMLE could be useful
for high dimensional parameters, where using a fluctuation parameter of the
same dimension as the parameter of interest could suffer the consequences of
curse of dimensionality. The clfm also enables placing the so-called clever
covariate denominator as an inverse weight in an offset intercept model. It has
been shown that such weighting mitigates the effect of large inverse weights
sometimes caused by near positivity violations.

measure these parameters from the response function of an optically trapped

over bulk microrheology measurements in viscoelastic Stokes-Oldroyd B fluids
which determine the complex elastic modulus $G(\omega)$ of the fluid, but do
not, however, reveal the characteristics of the polymer chains and the
Newtonian solvent of the complex fluid individually. In a recent work [Paul
\textit{et al}., 2018 J. Phys. Condens. Matter \textbf{30} 345101], we
linearized the Stokes-Oldroyd B fluid model and thereby explicitly formulated
the frequency dependent moduli in terms of ($\mu_p$) and ($\mu_s$), which we
now extend to account for an external sinusoidal force applied to the probe

compare with existing the $\lambda$ values in the literature for the same fluid
at some of the dilution levels, and obtain good agreement. Further, we use
these parameters to calculate the complex elastic modulus of the fluid again at
certain dilutions and verify successfully with existing data. This establishes
our method as an alternate approach in the active microrheology of complex
fluids which should reveal information about the composition of such fluids in
significantly greater detail and high signal to noise.

kinematics of galaxies. Here we introduce a semi-analytic model to quantify how
rotating outflows impact the morphology of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line.
The model is contrasted against Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of
outflowing gas with additional solid body rotation. We explore a range of
neutral Hydrogen optical depth of $10^5 \leq \tau_{\mathrm{H}} \leq10^7$,
rotational velocity $0 \leq v_{\mathrm{rot}}/\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1} \leq 100$ and
outflow velocity $0\leq v_{\mathrm{out}}/\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1} \leq 50$. We find
three consequences of rotation. First, it introduces a dependency with viewing
angle; second it broadens the line and third it increases the flux at the
line's center. For all viewing angles, the semi-analytic model reproduces the
radiative transfer results for the line width and flux change at the line's
center within a $7\%$ and $50\%$ precision for an optical depth of
$\tau_{\mathrm{H}}=10^5$, respectively, and within $2\%$ and $1\%$ for an
optical depth of $\tau_{\mathrm{H}}=10^7$. Using this model we also show that
the peaks of integrated spectra taken from opposite sides of an edge-on
rotating gas distribution should have a separation of
$\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{rot}}$. The semi-analytic model presented here is a
convenient tool to introduce rotational kinematics as a post-processing step of
idealized Monte Carlo simulations; it provides a framework to interpret \lya
spectra in systems where rotation is expected or directly measured through
kinematic maps.

For this reason, the hydrodynamic resistance matrix is typically needed when
modeling the motion of free purely Brownian, externally driven, or
self-propelled colloidal particles or the behavior of dilute suspensions of
such particles on the basis of Langevin equations, Smoluchowski equations,
classical dynamical density functional theory, or other appropriate methods. So
far, however, the hydrodynamic resistance matrix was available only for a few
particle shapes. In this article, we therefore present the hydrodynamic
resistance matrices for various particle shapes that are relevant for current
research, including apolar and polar as well as convex and partially concave
shapes. The elements of the hydrodynamic resistance matrices are given as
functions of shape parameters like the aspect ratio of the corresponding

distribution and that $k$ searchers are searching for it in parallel during $T$
rounds. We study the question of how to incentivize selfish players so that the
success probability, namely, the probability that at least one player finds the
treasure, would be maximized. We focus on congestion policies $C(s)$ that
specify the reward that a player receives if it is one of $s$ players that
(simultaneously) find the treasure for the first time. Our main technical
contribution is proving that the exclusive policy, in which $C(1)=1$ and
$C(s)=0$ for $s>1$, yields a price of anarchy of $(1-(1-{1}/{k})^{k})^{-1}$,
and that this is the best possible price among all symmetric reward mechanisms.
For this policy we also have an explicit description of a symmetric
equilibrium, which is in some sense unique, and moreover enjoys the best
success probability among all symmetric profiles. For general congestion
policies, we show how to polynomially find, for any $e>0$, a symmetric
multiplicative $(1+e)(1+C(k))$-equilibrium. Together with an appropriate reward
policy, a central entity can suggest players to play a particular profile at
equilibrium. As our main conceptual contribution, we advocate the use of
symmetric equilibria for such purposes. Besides being fair, we argue that in
many cases, despite the fact that some small fraction of players crash,
symmetric equilibria remain efficient in terms of their group performances and,
at the same time, serve as approximate equilibria. We show that this principle
holds for a class of games, which we call monotonously scalable games. This
applies in particular to our search game, assuming the sharing policy, in which
$C(s)=1/s$. For the exclusive policy, this general result does not hold, but we
show that the symmetric equilibrium is nevertheless robust under mild

introduced by an older laboratory instrument. In this paper, we validate that
conjecture by re-analyzing a section of the ice core using a more-advanced

narrow bandgaps and simultaneously high hole and electron mobilities for
bipolar transport, as well as methods to image and study spatial variations in
carrier type and associated conductivity with nanometer spatial resolution.
Here we demonstrate the general capability of near-field scanning microwave
microscopy (SMM) to image and study the local carrier type and associated
conductivity in operando by studying ambiploar field effect transistors (FETs)
of the 1D vdW material tellurium in 2D form. To quantitatively understand
electronic variations across the device, we produce nanometer resolved maps of
the local carrier equivalence backgate voltage. We show that the global device
conductivity minimum determined from transport measurements does not arise from
uniform carrier neutrality, but rather from the continued coexistence of p-type
regions at the device edge and n-type regions in the interior of our
micron-scale devices. This work both underscores and addresses the need to
image and understand spatial variations in the electronic properties of

matrices is a common subtask of many numerical calculations in electronic
structure theory or materials science. Solving the eigenvalue problem can
easily amount to a sizeable fraction of the whole numerical calculation. For
researchers in the field of computational materials science, an efficient and
scalable solution of the eigenvalue problem is thus of major importance. The
ELPA-library is a well-established dense direct eigenvalue solver library,
which has proven to be very efficient and scalable up to very large core
counts. In this paper, we describe the latest optimizations of the ELPA-library
for new HPC architectures of the Intel Skylake processor family with an AVX-512
SIMD instruction set, or for HPC systems accelerated with recent GPUs. We also
describe a complete redesign of the API in a modern modular way, which, apart
from a much simpler and more flexible usability, leads to a new path to access
system-specific performance optimizations. In order to ensure optimal
performance for a particular scientific setting or a specific HPC system, the
new API allows the user to influence in straightforward way the internal
details of the algorithms and of performance-critical parameters used in the
ELPA-library. On top of that, we introduced an autotuning functionality, which
allows for finding the best settings in a self-contained automated way. In
situations where many eigenvalue problems with similar settings have to be
solved consecutively, the autotuning process of the ELPA-library can be done
""on-the-fly"". Practical applications from materials science which rely on
so-called self-consistency iterations can profit from the autotuning. On some
examples of scientific interest, simulated with the FHI-aims application, the
advantages of the latest optimizations of the ELPA-library are demonstrated.

sub-picosecond laser pulses propagating in sub-mm long plasmas of near critical

used as targets. The NCD-plasma was produced by a mechanism of a super-sonic
ionization when a well-defined separate ns-pulse was sent onto the foam-target
forerunning the relativistic main pulse. The effect of the relativistic laser
pulse channeling and creation of quasi-static azimuthal magnetic and radial
electric fields that keeps electrons in the channel ensured effective coupling
of the laser energy into energetic electrons. Application of sub-mm thick low
density foam layers provided substantial increase of the electron acceleration
path in a NCD-plasma compared to the case of freely expanding plasmas created
in the interaction of the ns-laser pulse with solid foils. Performed
experiments on the electron heating by a 100J, 750 fs short laser pulse of
(2-5)x1019 W/cm2 intensity demonstrated that the effective temperature of
supra-thermal electrons increased from 1.5-2 MeV, in the case of the
relativistic laser interaction with a metallic foil at high laser contrast, up
to 13 MeV for the laser shots onto the pre-ionized foam. The observed tendency
towards the strong increase of the mean electron energy and the number of
ultra-relativistic laser-accelerated electrons is reinforced by the results of
gamma-yield measurements that showed a 1000-fold increase of the measured
doses. The experiment was supported by the 3D-PIC and FLUKA simulations made
for used laser parameters and geometry of the experimental set-up. Both
measurements and simulations show high directionality of the acceleration
process close to the direction of the laser pulse propagation. The charge of
super-ponderomotive electrons with E > 30 MeV reaches a high value of 78nC.

  constraints","Added Corollary 2, extended Conclusions",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the ILP Feasibility problem: given an integer linear program
$\{Ax = b, x\geq 0\}$, where $A$ is an integer matrix with $k$ rows and $\ell$
columns and $b$ is a vector of $k$ integers, we ask whether there exists
$x\in\mathbb{N}^\ell$ that satisfies $Ax = b$. Our goal is to study the
complexity of ILP Feasibility when both $k$, the number of constraints (rows of
$A$), and $\|A\|_\infty$, the largest absolute value in $A$, are small.
  Papadimitriou [J. ACM, 1981] was the first to give a fixed-parameter
algorithm for ILP Feasibility in this setting, with running time
$\left((\|A\mid b\|_\infty) \cdot k\right)^{O(k^2)}$. This was very recently
improved by Eisenbrand and Weismantel [SODA 2018], who used the Steinitz lemma
to design an algorithm with running time $(k\|A\|_\infty)^{O(k)}\cdot
\|b\|_\infty^2$, and subsequently by Jansen and Rohwedder [2018] to
$O(k\|A\|_\infty)^{k}\cdot \log \|b\|_\infty$. We prove that for
$\{0,1\}$-matrices $A$, the dependency on $k$ is probably optimal: an algorithm
with running time $2^{o(k\log k)}\cdot (\ell+\|b\|_\infty)^{o(k)}$ would
contradict ETH. This improves previous non-tight lower bounds of Fomin et al.
[ESA 2018].
  We then consider ILPs with many constraints, but structured in a shallow way.
Precisely, we consider the dual treedepth of the matrix $A$, which is the
treedepth of the graph over the rows of $A$, with two rows adjacent if in some
column they both contain a non-zero entry. It was recently shown by
Kouteck\'{y} et al. [ICALP 2018] that ILP Feasibility can be solved in time
$\|A\|_\infty^{2^{O(td(A))}}\cdot (k+\ell+\log \|b\|_\infty)^{O(1)}$. We
present a streamlined proof of this fact and prove optimality: even assuming
that all entries of $A$ and $b$ are in $\{-1,0,1\}$, the existence of an
algorithm with running time $2^{2^{o(td(A))}}\cdot (k+\ell)^{O(1)}$ would
contradict ETH.

Stacking Test from first principles and show that the p-value it reports is a
well-calibrated representation of noise fluctuations. When applying this test
to the detection of gravitational-wave transients in LIGO-Virgo data, we find
that it performs better than or comparably to other statistical tests

particularly well-suited for detecting classes of gravitational-wave transients

each speech segment in the utterance. The translation is improved by leveraging

These datasets are usually much larger than the computer's main memory; thus
external memory sorting algorithms, first introduced by Aggarwal and Vitter

sorting has been understood for decades by now, however the situation remains
elusive if we assume the keys to be sorted are integers. In internal memory,
one can sort a set of $n$ integer keys of $\Theta(\lg n)$ bits each in $O(n)$
time using the classic Radix Sort algorithm, however in external memory, there
are no faster integer sorting algorithms known than the simple comparison based
ones. In this paper, we present a tight conditional lower bound on the
complexity of external memory sorting of integers. Our lower bound is based on
a famous conjecture in network coding by Li and Li, who conjectured that
network coding cannot help anything beyond the standard multicommodity flow
rate in undirected graphs. The only previous work connecting the Li and Li
conjecture to lower bounds for algorithms is due to Adler et al. Adler et al.
indeed obtain relatively simple lower bounds for oblivious algorithms (the
memory access pattern is fixed and independent of the input data).
Unfortunately obliviousness is a strong limitations, especially for integer
sorting: we show that the Li and Li conjecture implies an $\Omega(n \log n)$
lower bound for internal memory oblivious sorting when the keys are $\Theta(\lg
n)$ bits. This is in sharp contrast to the classic (non-oblivious) Radix Sort
algorithm. Indeed going beyond obliviousness is highly non-trivial; we need to
introduce several new methods and involved techniques, which are of their own
interest, to obtain our tight lower bound for external memory integer sorting.

approaches on the stated-preference survey data for a new type of transit
system integrating high-frequency fixed-route services and ridesourcing. The
results show that machine learning can produce significantly higher predictive
accuracy than logit models. Moreover, machine learning and logit models largely
agree on many aspects of behavioral interpretations. In addition, machine
learning can automatically capture the nonlinear relationship between the input
features and choice outcomes. The paper concludes that there is great potential
in merging ideas from machine learning and conventional statistical methods to
develop refined models for travel behavior research and suggests some new
research directions.

of deep neural networks either to powerful optimizers or the new network
design. Different from them, in this paper, we aim to link the generalization
ability of a deep network to optimizing a new objective function. To this end,
we propose a \textit{nonlinear collaborative scheme} for deep network training,
with the key technique as combining different loss functions in a nonlinear
manner. We find that after adaptively tuning the weights of different loss
functions, the proposed objective function can efficiently guide the
optimization process. What is more, we demonstrate that, from the mathematical
perspective, the nonlinear collaborative scheme can lead to (i) smaller KL
divergence with respect to optimal solutions; (ii) data-driven stochastic
gradient descent; (iii) tighter PAC-Bayes bound. We also prove that its
advantage can be strengthened by nonlinearity increasing. To some extent, we
bridge the gap between learning (i.e., minimizing the new objective function)
and generalization (i.e., minimizing a PAC-Bayes bound) in the new scheme. We
also interpret our findings through the experiments on Residual Networks and
DenseNet, showing that our new scheme performs superior to single-loss and
multi-loss schemes no matter with randomization or not.

that the vertex centrality measures known as information, eigenvector,

achieved a considerably lower result. In addition, we demonstrate that several
pairs of metrics evaluate the vertices in a very similar way, i.e. their

propagation is modulated by coronal structures, whose magnetic field we still
cannot measure. However, when a front impacts coronal structures, an
opportunity arises for us to look into the magnetic properties of both
interacting parties in the low-$\beta$ corona. Here we studied large-scale EUV
fronts accompanying three coronal mass ejections (CMEs), each originating from
a kinking rope-like structure in the NOAA active region (AR) 12371. These
eruptions were homologous and the surrounding coronal structures remained
stationary. Hence we treated the events as one observed from three different
viewing angles, and found that the primary front directly associated with the
CME consistently transmits through 1) a polar coronal hole, 2) the ends of a
crescent-shaped equatorial coronal hole, leaving a stationary front outlining
its AR-facing boundary, and 3) two quiescent filaments, producing slow and
diffuse secondary fronts. The primary front also propagates along an arcade of
coronal loops and slows down due to foreshortening at the far side, where local
plasma heating is indicated by an enhancement in 211 {\AA} (Fe XIV) but a
dimming in 193 {\AA} (Fe XII) and 171 {\AA} (Fe IX). The strength of coronal
magnetic field is therefore estimated to be $\sim\,$2 G in the polar coronal
hole and $\sim\,$4 G in the coronal arcade neighboring the active region. These
observations substantiate the wave nature of the primary front and shed new
light on slow fronts.

extract the liver volume of interests (VOI) and segment tumors from the liver
VOI. The proposed network has a basic architecture as a 3D U-Net which extracts
contextual information combining low-level feature maps with high-level ones.
Attention modules are stacked so that the attention-aware features change
adaptively as the network goes ""very deep"" and this is made possible by
residual learning. This is the first work that an attention residual mechanism
is used to process medical volumetric images. We evaluated our framework on the

to parse (user) utterances into semantic concepts called slots. An ontology is
defined by the collection of slots and the values that each slot can take. The
widely-used practice of treating slot filling as a sequence labeling task
suffers from two drawbacks. First, the ontology is usually pre-defined and
fixed. Most current methods are unable to predict new labels for unseen slots.
Second, the one-hot encoding of slot labels ignores the semantic meanings and
relations for slots, which are implicit in their natural language descriptions.
These observations motivate us to propose a novel model called elastic
conditional random field (eCRF), for open-ontology slot filling. eCRFs can
leverage the neural features of both the utterance and the slot descriptions,
and are able to model the interactions between different slots. Experimental
results show that eCRFs outperforms existing models on both the in-domain and

manifold learning-based regularization to explicitly retain local structures of
latent samples in the generated samples. This prevents generator from producing
nearly identical data samples from different latent samples, and reduces mode
collapse. We propose an inverse t-SNE regularizer to achieve this. Second, we
propose a new technique, gradient matching, to align the distributions of the
generated samples and the real samples. As it is challenging to work with
high-dimensional sample distributions, we propose to align these distributions
through the scalar discriminator scores. We constrain the difference between
the discriminator scores of the real samples and generated ones. We further
constrain the difference between the gradients of these discriminator scores.
We derive these constraints from Taylor approximations of the discriminator
function. We perform experiments to demonstrate that our proposed techniques
are computationally simple and easy to be incorporated in existing systems.

primary structure of protein. The order of amino acids in a sequence enables a

functions of the protein. This relationship between a sequence and its function
motivates the need to analyse the sequences for predicting protein functions.
Early generation computational methods using BLAST, FASTA, etc. perform
function transfer based on sequence similarity with existing databases and are
computationally slow. Although machine learning based approaches are fast, they
fail to perform well for long protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences with
more than 300 amino acid residues). In this paper, we introduce a novel method
for construction of two separate feature sets for protein sequences based on
analysis of 1) single fixed-sized segments and 2) multi-sized segments, using
bi-directional long short-term memory network. Further, model based on proposed
feature set is combined with the state of the art Multi-lable Linear
Discriminant Analysis (MLDA) features based model to improve the accuracy.
Extensive evaluations using separate datasets for biological processes and
molecular functions demonstrate promising results for both single-sized and
multi-sized segments based feature sets. While former showed an improvement of
+3.37% and +5.48%, the latter produces an improvement of +5.38% and +8.00%

After combining two models, there is a significant improvement of +7.41% and

predictive-coding ideas. The model learns to extract the probabilistic
structures hidden in fluctuating temporal patterns by dynamically changing the
stochasticity of its latent states. Its architecture attempts to address two
major concerns of variational Bayes RNNs: how can latent variables learn
meaningful representations and how can the inference model transfer future
observations to the latent variables. PV-RNN does both by introducing adaptive
vectors mirroring the training data, whose values can then be adapted
differently during evaluation. Moreover, prediction errors during
backpropagation, rather than external inputs during the forward computation,
are used to convey information to the network about the external data. For
testing, we introduce error regression for predicting unseen sequences as
inspired by predictive coding that leverages those mechanisms. The model
introduces a weighting parameter, the meta-prior, to balance the optimization
pressure placed on two terms of a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the
sequential data. We test the model on two datasets with probabilistic
structures and show that with high values of the meta-prior the network
develops deterministic chaos through which the data's randomness is imitated.
For low values, the model behaves as a random process. The network performs
best on intermediate values, and is able to capture the latent probabilistic
structure with good generalization. Analyzing the meta-prior's impact on the
network allows to precisely study the theoretical value and practical benefits
of incorporating stochastic dynamics in our model. We demonstrate better
prediction performance on a robot imitation task with our model using error
regression compared to a standard variational Bayes model lacking such a
procedure.

light is attenuated while it propagates through water. Attenuation under water
varies with wavelength, unlike terrestrial images where attenuation is assumed

the 3D structure of the scene, making color restoration difficult.
  Unlike existing single underwater image enhancement techniques, our method
takes into account multiple spectral profiles of different water types. By
estimating just two additional global parameters: the attenuation ratios of the

dehazing, where all color channels have the same attenuation coefficients.
Since the water type is unknown, we evaluate different parameters out of an
existing library of water types. Each type leads to a different restored image
and the best result is automatically chosen based on color distribution.
  We collected a dataset of images taken in different locations with varying

size, both ""horizontally"" in the number of nodes, as well as ""vertically"" in
the number of cores per node. As such, they offer additional levels of hardware
parallelism. Each such level requires and employs algorithms for appropriately
scheduling the computational work at the respective level. The present work
explores the relation between two scheduling levels: batch and application.
Understanding this relation is important for improving the performance of
scientific applications, that are scheduled and executed in batches on HPC
systems. The relation between batch and application level scheduling is
understudied in the literature. Understanding the relation and interaction
between these two scheduling levels requires their simultaneous analysis during
operation. In this work, such an analysis is performed via simultaneous
simulation of batch and application level scheduling for a number of scenarios.
A generic simulation approach is presented that bridges two existing simulators
from the two scheduling levels. A novel two-level simulator that implements the
proposed approach is introduced. The two-level simulator is used to simulate
all combinations of three batch scheduling and four application scheduling
algorithms from the literature. These combinations are considered for
allocating resources and executing the parallel jobs of two batches from two
production HPC systems. The results of the scheduling experiments reveal the
strong relation between the two scheduling levels and their mutual influence.
Complementing the simulations, the two-level simulator produces standard
parallel execution traces, which can visually be examined and which illustrate
the execution of different jobs and, for each job, the execution of its tasks
at node and core levels, respectively.

consecutive steps to recommend items to each target user: first they calculate
the similarities among users, then they estimate concordance of pairwise

they use estimated pairwise preferences to infer the total ranking of items for
the target user. This general approach faces some problems as the rank data is
usually sparse as users usually have compared only a few pairs of items and
consequently, the similarities among users is calculated based on limited
information and is not accurate enough for inferring true values of preference
concordance and can lead to an invalid ranking of items. This article presents
a novel framework, called IteRank, that models the data as a bipartite network
containing users and pairwise preferences. It then simultaneously refines
users' similarities and preferences' concordances using a random walk method on
this graph structure. It uses the information in this first step in another
network structure for simultaneously adjusting the concordances of preferences
and rankings of items. Using this approach, IteRank can overcome some existing
problems caused by the sparsity of the data. Experimental results show that
IteRank improves the performance of recommendation compared to the state of the

mainly consider bounded width circuits. The main purpose of this part is to
prove that there is a Boolean function $f$ which cannot be computed by any
nondeterministic circuit of size $O(n)$ and width $o(n)$. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first result on the lower bound of (nonuniform) bounded
width circuits computing an explicit Boolean function, even for deterministic
circuits. Actually, we prove a more generalized lower bound. Our proof outline
for the lower bound also provides a satisfiability algorithm for
nondeterministic bounded width circuits. In the second part of this paper, we
consider the power of nondeterministic circuits. We prove that there is a
Boolean function $f$ such that the nondeterministic $U_2$-circuit complexity of
$f$ is at most $2n + o(n)$ and the deterministic $U_2$-circuit complexity of
$f$ is $3n - o(n)$. This is the first separation on the power of deterministic

that $\mathsf{L/quasipoly} \supset \mathsf{NL}$. To the best of our knowledge,

health. The mounting evidence suggests that this transport is in fact
anomalous. However, the reasons for the anomaly is still under debate. We
examined experimental trajectories of organelles inside a living cell and
propose a mathematical model that describes the previously reported transition
from sub-diffusive to super-diffusive motion. In order to explain
super-diffusive behaviour at long times, we introduce non-Markovian detachment
kinetics of the cargo: the rate of detachment is inversely proportional to the
time since the last attachment. Recently, we observed the non-Markovian
detachment rate experimentally in eukaryotic cells. Here we further discuss
different scenarios of how this effective non-Markovian detachment rate could
arise. The non-Markovian model is successful in simultaneously describing the
time-averaged variance (the time-averaged mean squared displacement corrected
for directed motion), the mean first passage time of trajectories and the
multiple peaks observed in the distributions of cargo velocities. We argue that
non-Markovian kinetics could be biologically beneficial compared to the
Markovian kinetics commonly used for modelling, by increasing the average
distance the cargoes travel when a microtubule is blocked by other filaments.
In turn, sub-diffusion allows cargoes to reach neighbouring filaments with
higher probability, which promotes active motion along the microtubules.

what the maximum mutual-information decoder is for constant composition codes.
We show that this decoder results in exactly the same i.i.d. random coding

algorithm for computation of the optimal correct-decoding exponent which
operates on the corresponding expression for the channel-independent decoder.
The proposed algorithm comes in two versions: computation at a fixed rate and
for a fixed slope. The fixed-slope version of the algorithm presents an
alternative to the Arimoto algorithm for computation of the random coding
exponent function in the correct-decoding regime. The fixed-rate version of the
computation algorithm translates into a stochastic iterative algorithm for
adaptation of the i.i.d. codebook distribution to a discrete memoryless channel
in the limit of large block length. The adaptation scheme uses i.i.d. random
codes with the channel-independent decoder and relies on one bit of feedback
per transmitted block. The communication itself is assumed reliable at a
constant rate $R$. In the end of the iterations the resulting codebook
distribution guarantees reliable communication for all rates below $R + \Delta$
for some predetermined parameter of decoding confidence $\Delta > 0$, provided
that $R + \Delta$ is less than the channel capacity.

solved by means of a perturbative method and the nonlinear current density of

nonlinearity of the laser beam amplitude, a nonlinear equation describing the

considering the nonlinearity of system through solving nonlinear equation of

sides of the ablation site. In order to demonstrate the potential of the
method, experiments have been conducted with copper and titanium as the target
materials that are placed in two different liquid media (water and isopropyl
alcohol). The ablation of the target material immersed in the liquid medium has
been carried out using an Nd:YAG laser. Significant differences in the size and
size distributions are observed in the cases of nanoparticles produced with and
without confining boundaries. It is seen that for any given liquid medium and
the target material, the mean size of the nanoparticles obtained with the
boundary-fitted target surface is consistently higher than that achieved in the
case of open (flat) targets. The observed trend has been attributed to the
plausible role(s) of the confining boundaries in prolonging the thermalisation
time of the plasma plume. In order to ascertain that the observed differences
in sizes of the nanoparticles produced with and without the presence of the
physical barriers are predominantly because of the prolonged thermalisation of
the plasma plume and not due to the possible formation of oxide layer, select
experiments with gold as the target material in water have also been performed.
The experiments also show that, irrespective of the liquid medium, the increase
in the mean size of the copper-based nanoparticles due to the presence of
physical boundaries is relatively higher than that observed in the case of
titanium target material under similar experimental conditions.

formation mode of supermassive black holes exceeding $10^9~M_\odot$ in the

finite amounts of heavy elements contained in the gas and dust. In our 1D
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the radiative transfer is solved for both
the direct UV lights emitted by an accretion disk and the diffuse IR lights
thermally emitted by dust grains. Our results show that the radiative force by
the IR lights causes a strong feedback to regulate the mass accretion. The
resulting mean accretion rate is lower with the higher metallicity, and there
is the critical metallicity $Z \sim 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$, above which the
super-Eddington accretion is prevented by the radiation pressure of the IR
lights. With this taken into account, we examine if the dusty super-Eddington
accretion occurs in young galaxies using a simple model. We show that a
sufficient number of galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ can be such potential sites if
BHs accrete the cold dense gas with $T \sim 10^2$ K, approximately the thermal
equilibrium value at $Z = 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$. We argue that the efficiency of the

gives a robust, nonlinear, optimization-free, and fast method for detection of
overlapping objects, even without any rigid pattern. This novel method was
verified on fish (European bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, and tiger barbs, Puntius
tetrazona) swimming in a reasonably small tank, which forced them to exhibit a
large variety of shapes. Compared with manual detection, the correct number of
objects was determined for up to almost $90 \%$ of overlaps, and the mean
Dice-Sorensen coefficient was around $0.83$. This implies that this method is
feasible in real-life applications such as toxicity testing.

of Gasperini, Marozzi and Veneziano (2010) that may prove useful for a number
of applications. The covariant nature of spatial scalar averaging schemes to
address the averaging problem in relativistic cosmology is an important
property that is implied by construction, but usually remains implicit. We
employ here the approach of Gasperini et al. for two reasons. First, the
formalism and its generalization presented here are manifestly covariant.
Second, the formalism is convenient for disentangling the dependencies on
foliation, volume measure, and boundaries in the averaged expressions entering
in scalar averaging schemes. These properties will prove handy for simplifying
expressions, but also for investigating extremal foliations and for comparing
averaged properties of different foliations directly. The proposed
generalization of the window function allows for choosing the most appropriate
averaging scheme for the physical problem at hand, and for distinguishing
between the role of the foliation itself and the role of the volume measure in
averaged dynamic equations. We also show that one particular window function
obtained from this generalized class results in an averaging scheme
corresponding to that of a recent investigation by Buchert, Mourier and Roy
(2018) and, as a byproduct, we explicitly show that the general equations for
backreaction derived therein are covariant.

engineering with automated feature learning. However, little is known about
what types of context information end-to-end TTS extracts from text input

is barely utilized. In this work, we first point out the model similarity
between end-to-end TTS and parametric TTS. Based on the similarity, we evaluate
the quality of encoder outputs from an end-to-end TTS system against eight
criteria that are derived from a standard set of context information used in
parametric TTS. We conduct experiments using an evaluation procedure that has
been newly developed in the machine learning literature for quantitative
analysis of neural representations, while adapting it to the TTS domain.
Experimental results show that the encoder outputs reflect both linguistic and
phonetic contexts, such as vowel reduction at phoneme level, lexical stress at
syllable level, and part-of-speech at word level, possibly due to the joint
optimization of context and acoustic features.

jumps of reconstructed values at cell boundaries. In the P4-THINC-BVD scheme,
polynomial of degree four and THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface

the candidate functions by a two-stage cascade BVD algorithm so as to
effectively control numerical oscillation and dissipation. Spectral analysis

following desirable properties: 1) it effectively suppresses spurious numerical
oscillation in the presence of strong shock or discontinuity; 2) it
substantially reduces numerical dissipation errors; 3) it automatically
retrieves the underlying linear 5th-order upwind scheme for smooth solution
over all wave numbers; 4) it is able to resolve both smooth and discontinuous
flow structures of all scales with substantially improved solution quality in

Deep Filtering method used by George and Huerta (2017) for multi-inputs of

distance and sky location. As a classifier, our deep neural network (DNN) can
effectively recognize the presence of GW signals when the optimal
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of network detectors $\geq$ 9. As a predictor, it
can also effectively estimate the corresponding source space parameters,
including the luminosity distance $D$, right ascension $\alpha$, and
declination $\delta$ of the compact binary star mergers. When the SNR of the
network detectors is greater than 8, their relative errors are all less than
23%. Our results demonstrate that Deep Filtering can process coincident GW time

estimation. Furthermore, we compare the results obtained from one, two, and

bugs. Each bug in Defects4J comes with a test suite and at least one failing
test case that triggers the bug. In this paper, we report on an experiment to
explore the effectiveness of automatic test-suite based repair on Defects4J.
The result of our experiment shows that the considered state-of-the-art repair
methods can generate patches for 47 out of 224 bugs. However, those patches are
only test-suite adequate, which means that they pass the test suite and may
potentially be incorrect beyond the test-suite satisfaction correctness
criterion. We have manually analyzed 84 different patches to assess their real
correctness. In total, 9 real Java bugs can be correctly repaired with
test-suite based repair. This analysis shows that test-suite based repair
suffers from under-specified bugs, for which trivial or incorrect patches still
pass the test suite. With respect to practical applicability, it takes on
average 14.8 minutes to find a patch. The experiment was done on a scientific
grid, totaling 17.6 days of computation time. All the repair systems and
experimental results are publicly available on Github in order to facilitate
future research on automatic repair.

countable language that has more than $\aleph_0$ pairwise non-isomorphic
countably infinite models, then $T$ has $2^{\aleph_0}$ such models. Morley
showed that if $T$ has more than $\aleph_1$ pairwise non-isomorphic countably
infinite models, then it has $2^{\aleph_0}$ such models.\\ In this paper, we
re-prove Morley's result and prove the corresponding statement for languages
without equality, and for theories which are not necessarily complete. Our
proof uses algebraic logic, namely the representation theory of cylindric and
quasi-polyadic algebras. Also, as in Morley's proof, we use results from
descriptive set theory. After all this, we show that our proof can be modified
to talk about the number of models omitting a certain family of types.

for applications in nuclear instrumentation, such as calorimetry and timing.
The ""hybrid"" configuration used in the PANDA detector was found to show the
fastest timing properties with several hundred pico second response by
combining the advantages of a large active area while avoiding high operation
voltages and dark noise. A ""parallel"" configuration shows the largest light
collection efficiency and is therefore suitable for energy measurements.
Several calibration spectra were taken to measure the energy deposit of minimal
ionizing cosmic muons in a two-centimeter-thick PbWO$_4$ crystal.

time resolved photoluminiscence spectroscopy (TRPL), X-ray absorption near edge
spectroscopy (XANES), Raman spectroscopy and structural techniques such as
X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the oxidation state, physical and chemical
form of uranium in this region. Oxidation state analysis by fluorescence
spectroscopy revealed majority of the samples in U(VI) oxidation state. The
most abundant form of uranium was identified as uranate (UO66-) ion, as a
substituent of Ca++ in Ca5(PO4)3F, Flourapatite (FAP). Two uranium species in
U(VI) and U(IV) state; (UO2)2+ adsorbed on silica and uranium oxide species
(UO2) were also identified. The study provided baseline information on the
