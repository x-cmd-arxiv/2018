  More than 200 jets of different intensities were identified directly on the

spectral behavior to icy grains mixed with the ejected dust. Some of the jets
have an extremely short lifetime. They appear on the cometary surface during
the color sequence observations, and vanish in less than some few minutes after
reaching their peak. We also report a resolved dust plume observed in May 2016
at a resolution of 55 cm/pixel, which allowed us to estimate an optical depth
of $\sim$0.65 and an ejected mass of $\sim$ 2200 kg.
  We present the results on the location, duration, and colors of active
sources on the nucleus of 67P from the medium-resolution (i.e., 6-10 m/pixel)

located close to boundaries between different morphological regions.
  Jets depart not only from cliffs, but also from smooth and dust-covered
areas, from fractures, pits, or cavities that cast shadows and favor the
recondensation of volatiles. This study shows that faint jets or outbursts
continuously contribute to the cometary activity close to perihelion passage,

(1) to investigate to what extent planetary nebulae (PNe) are chemically

properties of each PN. We accomplished the first goal by using HST/STIS spectra
to measure the abundances of seven elements in numerous spatial regions within
each of six PN (IC 2165, IC 3568, NGC 2440, NGC 5315, NGC 5882, and NGC 7662).
The second goal was achieved by computing a photoionization model of each
nebula, using our observed emission line strengths as constraints. The major
finding of our study is that the nebular abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, S, and
Ar are consistent with a chemically homogeneous picture for each PN.
Additionally, we found through experimenting with three different density
profiles (constant, Gaussian, and Gaussian with a power-law) that the
determination of the central star's temperature and luminosity is only slightly
sensitive to the profile choice. Lastly, post-AGB evolutionary model
predictions of temperature and luminosity available in the literature were
plotted along with the values inferred from the photoionization model analysis
to yield initial and final mass estimates of each central star.

requested to be consistent even down to the real contact scenarios, belong to
the most challenging and still unsolved problems in computational mechanics.
The main challenges are twofold - one is to have a correct physical model for
this scenario, and the other one is to have a numerical method that is capable
of working and being consistent down to a zero gap. And when analyzing such
challenging setups of fluid-structure interaction that include contact of
submersed solid components it gets obvious that the influence of surface
roughness effects is essential for a physical consistent modeling of such
configurations. To capture this system behavior, we present a continuum
mechanical model which is able to include the effects of the surface
microstructure in a fluid-structure-contact interaction framework. An averaged
representation for the mixture of fluid and solid on the rough surfaces, which
is of major interest for the macroscopic response of such a system, is
introduced therein. The inherent coupling of the macroscopic fluid flow and the
flow inside the rough surfaces, the stress exchange of all contacting solid
bodies involved, and the interaction between fluid and solid is included in the
construction of the model. Although the physical model is not restricted to
finite element based methods, a numerical approach with its core based on the
Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM), enabling topological changes of the fluid
domain to solve the presented model numerically, is introduced. Such a CutFEM
based approach is able to deal with the numerical challenges mentioned above.
Different test cases give a perspective towards the potential capabilities of
the presented physical model and numerical approach.

for the radial migration of Neptune. The outer planets' orbits are thought to
have become unstable during the early stages with Jupiter having scattering
encounters with a Neptune-class planet. As a consequence, Jupiter jumped inward
by a fraction of an au, as required from inner solar system constraints, and
obtained its current orbital eccentricity. The timing of these events is often
linked to the lunar Late Heavy Bombardment that ended ~700 Myr after the
dispersal of the protosolar nebula (t_0). Here we show instead that planetary
migration started shortly after t_0. Such early migration is inferred from the
survival of the Patroclus-Menoetius binary Jupiter Trojan. The binary formed at
t <~ t_0 within a massive planetesimal disk once located beyond Neptune. The
longer the binary stayed in the disk, the greater the likelihood that
collisions would strip its components from one another. The simulations of its
survival indicate that the disk had to have been dispersed by migrating planets
within <100 Myr of t_0. This constraint implies that the planetary migration is
unrelated to the formation of the youngest lunar basins.

crowdsourcing platforms are most effective for simple questions, we assume that
each Correspondence Correctness Question (CCQ) asks the crowd to decide whether
a given correspondence should exist in the correct matching. Furthermore,
members of a crowd may sometimes return incorrect answers with different
probabilities. Accuracy rates of individual crowd workers are probabilities of
returning correct answers which can be attributes of CCQs as well as
evaluations of individual workers. We prove that uncertainty reduction equals
to entropy of answers minus entropy of crowds and show how to obtain lower and
upper bounds for it. We propose frameworks and efficient algorithms to
dynamically manage the CCQs to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a
limited budget of questions. We develop two novel approaches, namely `Single

uncorrelated normal distribution. However, for AR(1), the underlying process is
correlated. All traditional results break down and the resulting t-statistic is
a new distribution that converges asymptotically to a normal. We give an
explicit formula for this new distribution obtained as the ratio of two
dependent distribution (a normal and the distribution of the norm of another

follows a non central t-distribution. Its derivation comes from finding an
orthogonal basis for the the initial circulant Toeplitz covariance matrix. Our
findings are consistent with the asymptotic distribution for the t-statistic
derived for the asympotic case of large number of observations or zero

chiral SU(3) model within the mean field approximation (MFA). The dependence of
the vector meson masses on density and temperature, their variation with the
asymmetry parameter, the form of the spectral function when the p <-> n

longitudinal and the transverse modes among the rho isospin multiplets. The
role of a running tensor coupling on the spectral function is also studied.

  workshop at EMNLP 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sequential neural networks models are powerful tools in a variety of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The sequential nature of these models raises
the questions: to what extent can these models implicitly learn hierarchical
structures typical to human language, and what kind of grammatical phenomena
can they acquire?
  We focus on the task of agreement prediction in Basque, as a case study for a
task that requires implicit understanding of sentence structure and the
acquisition of a complex but consistent morphological system. Analyzing
experimental results from two syntactic prediction tasks -- verb number
prediction and suffix recovery -- we find that sequential models perform worse
on agreement prediction in Basque than one might expect on the basis of a
previous agreement prediction work in English. Tentative findings based on
diagnostic classifiers suggest the network makes use of local heuristics as a
proxy for the hierarchical structure of the sentence. We propose the Basque
agreement prediction task as challenging benchmark for models that attempt to
learn regularities in human language.

well produced by hadro-chemical freezeout at temperatures near the QCD

hadronic matter, conserves the effective numbers of particles which are stable
under strong interactions, most notably pions, kaons and nucleons. It turns out
that the large chemical potentials that build up for antibaryons result in
thermal abundances of light nuclei and antinuclei, formed at thermal freezeout,
which essentially agree with the ones evaluated at chemical freezeout. Together
with their transverse-momentum spectra, which also indicate a kinetic freezeout

between the sites, is sometimes modelled by a product of random matrices, with
each diagonal elements representing the growth rate in a given time period, and
off-diagonal elements the migration rate. The randomness of the matrices then
represents stochasticity of environmental conditions. We consider the case
where the off-diagonal elements are small, representing a situation where
migration has been introduced into an otherwise sessile meta-population. We
examine the asymptotic behaviour of the long-term growth rate. When there is a
single site with the highest growth rate, under the assumption of Gaussian log
growth rates at the individual sites (or having Gaussian-like tails) we show
that the behavior near zero is like a power of $\epsilon$, and derive upper and
lower bounds for the power in terms of the difference in the growth rates and
the distance between the sites. In particular, when the difference in mean log
growth rate between two sites is sufficiently small, or the variance of the
difference between the sites sufficiently large, migration will always be
favored by natural selection, in the sense that introducing a small amount of
migration will increase the growth rate of the population relative to the

achieved at two different sites. The primary motivation is to cover the case
where `sites' are understood as age classes for the same individuals. The
theory then calculates the effect on growth rate of introducing a rare delay in
development, a diapause, into an otherwise fixed-length semelparous life
history.
  Whereas the increase in stochastic growth rate due to rare migrations was
found to grow as a power of the migration rate, we show that under quite
general conditions that in the diapause model --- or in the migration model
with two or more sites having equal individual stochastic growth rates --- the
increase in stochastic growth rate due to diapause at rate $\epsilon$ behaves
like $(\log \epsilon^{-1})^{-1}$ as $\epsilon\downarrow 0$. In particular, this

building blocks for large scale probabilistic circuits that can be designed to
perform useful functions. Interestingly, this three-terminal unit looks just
like the 1T/MTJ device used in embedded MRAM technology, with only one
difference: the use of an LBM for the MTJ free layer. We hope that the concept
of p-bits and p-circuits will help open up new application spaces for this
emerging technology. However, a p-bit need not involve an MTJ, any fluctuating
resistor could be combined with a transistor to implement it, while completely
digital implementations using conventional CMOS technology are also possible.
The p-bit also provides a conceptual bridge between two active but disjoint

First, there are the applications that are based on the similarity of a p-bit
to the binary stochastic neuron (BSN), a well-known concept in machine
learning. Three-terminal p-bits could provide an efficient hardware accelerator
for the BSN. Second, there are the applications that are based on the p-bit

planning the motion of the robots to track the targets. A major challenge for
practical deployments is to make the robots resilient to failures. In
particular, robots may be attacked in adversarial scenarios, or their sensors
may fail or get occluded. In this paper, we introduce planning algorithms for
multi-target tracking that are resilient to such failures. In general,
resilient target tracking is computationally hard. Contrary to the case where
there are no failures, no scalable approximation algorithms are known for
resilient target tracking when the targets are indistinguishable, or unknown in
number, or with unknown motion model. In this paper we provide the first such
algorithm, that also has the following properties: First, it achieves maximal
resiliency, since the algorithm is valid for any number of failures. Second, it
is scalable, as our algorithm terminates with the same running time as
state-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient) target tracking. Third, it
provides provable approximation bounds on the tracking performance, since our
algorithm guarantees a solution that is guaranteed to be close to the optimal.
We quantify our algorithm's approximation performance using a novel notion of
curvature for monotone set functions subject to matroid constraints. Finally,
we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through MATLAB and Gazebo
simulations, and a sensitivity analysis; we focus on scenarios that involve a

of the baryons are carried away by the nuclear remnants and are located in the
so-called fragmentation regions. In previous papers
\cite{Li:2016wzh,Li:2018ini}, it has been argued that very high baryon
densities, more than ten times larger than the normal nuclear density, can be
achieved in these fragmentation regions. In this paper, we assume the high
baryon density matter is thermalized at the same time as the baryon-free
quark-gluon plasma in the central rapidity region. We perform a 1+1D (temporal
+ longitudinal) hydrodynamic simulation covering both the fragmentation regions
and the central rapidity region with the baryon diffusion equation included.
Baryons are found to diffuse from the fragmentation regions to the central
rapidity region driven by fugacity gradients. The baryon chemical potential at
freezeout monotonically increases from the central rapidity region to the
fragmentation regions, suggesting a rapidity scan in high energy heavy-ion
collisions might be helpful in searching for the critical point of the QCD

that the spread of the ensemble is too small, resulting in underdispersive
forecasts, leading to a lack of calibration. In order to correct this problem,
different statistical calibration techniques have been developed in the last
two decades. In the present work different post-processing techniques are
tested for calibrating 9 member ensemble forecast of temperature for Santiago
de Chile, obtained by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using
different planetary boundary layer and land surface model parametrization. In
particular, the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) and Bayesian model
averaging techniques are implemented and since the observations are
characterized by large altitude differences, the estimation of model parameters
is adapted to the actual conditions at hand. Compared to the raw ensemble all
tested post-processing approaches significantly improve the calibration of
probabilistic and the accuracy of point forecasts. The EMOS method using
parameter estimation based on expert clustering of stations (according to their
altitudes) shows the best forecast skill.

cosmology from SN Ia by measuring purely kinematical $\left( q,j \right)$ model
parameters (where $q$ and $j$ are related to the first and second derivative of
the Hubble parameter). For the JLA compilation of SN Ia an agreement within
2$\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM expectations is found, where best-fitting kinematical
parameters are $q=-0.66 \pm 0.11$ and $j=0.41 ^{+0.32}_{-0.33}$. With $q=-0.73
\pm 0.13$ and $j=0.76 ^{+0.41}_{-0.43}$ the Pantheon sample shows even better
agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation of $j=1$ than JLA, hinting at less
systematics and/or a higher number of SN Ia alleviating tensions. For the
future we predict the precision achievable with SN Ia from the LSST deep survey
as $\Delta q \sim 0.05$ and $\Delta j \sim 0.1$, which is systematics-limited
and could lead to detect both deviations from $\Lambda$CDM (in $j$) or current
expansion rates measured (in $q$). In comparison, for standard cosmological
parameters we get $\Delta \Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.01$ and $\Delta w=0.07$ for LSST.
Given the high number of SN Ia expected for LSST, kinematical parameters in up
to 500 sky regions, each with their own individual Hubble diagram, can be
constrained. For each region an individual precision at the 10s of percent
level is within reach at current systematics-levels, comparable to present-day
full-sky surveys. This will determine anisotropy in cosmic expansion, or the
dark energy dipole, at the 10s of percent level at 10s of degree scales.

cavities in use, however, hydrogen is readily absorbed by niobium during cavity
fabrication and subsequent niobium hydride precipitation when cooled to
cryogenic temperatures degrades its superconducting properties. In the last few
years the addition of dopant elements such as nitrogen has been experimentally
shown to significantly improve the quality factor of niobium SRF cavities. One
of the contributors to Q degradation can be presence of hydrides, however, the
underlying mechanisms associated with the kinetics of hydrogen and the
thermodynamic stability of hydride precipitates in the presence of dopants are
not well known. Using first principles calculations, the effects of nitrogen on
the energetic preference for hydrogen to occupy interstitial sites and hydride
stability are examined. In particular, the presence of nitrogen significantly
increased the energy barrier for hydrogen diffusion from one tetrahedral site
to another interstitial site. Furthermore, the beta niobium hydride precipitate
became energetically unstable upon addition of nitrogen in the niobium matrix.
Through electronic density of states and valence charge transfer calculations,
nitrogen showed a strong tendency to accumulate charge around itself, thereby
decreasing the strength of covalent bonds between niobium and hydrogen atoms
leading to a very unstable state for hydrogen and hydrides. These calculations
show that the presence of nitrogen during processing plays a critical role in
controlling hydride precipitation and subsequent SRF properties.

high-speed and high-acceleration) maneuvers have attracted significant
attention in the past few years. This paper focuses on accurate tracking of
aggressive quadcopter trajectories. We propose a novel control law for tracking
of position and yaw angle and their derivatives of up to fourth order,
specifically, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap along with yaw rate and
yaw acceleration. Jerk and snap are tracked using feedforward inputs for
angular rate and angular acceleration based on the differential flatness of the
quadcopter dynamics. Snap tracking requires direct control of body torque,
which we achieve using closed-loop motor speed control based on measurements
from optical encoders attached to the motors. The controller utilizes
incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) for robust tracking of linear
and angular accelerations despite external disturbances, such as aerodynamic
drag forces. Hence, prior modeling of aerodynamic effects is not required. We
rigorously analyze the proposed control law through response analysis, and we
demonstrate it in experiments. The controller enables a quadcopter UAV to track
complex 3D trajectories, reaching speeds up to 12.9 m/s and accelerations up to
2.1g, while keeping the root-mean-square tracking error down to 6.6 cm, in a
flight volume that is roughly 18 m by 7 m and 3 m tall. We also demonstrate the
robustness of the controller by attaching a drag plate to the UAV in flight
tests and by pulling on the UAV with a rope during hover.

Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and MERLIN radio maps of powerful jet
sources for morphological evidence of geodetic precession. For perhaps the best
studied source, Cygnus A, we find strong evidence for geodetic precession.
Projection effects can enhance precession features, for which we find
indications in strongly projected sources. For a complete sample of 33 3CR
radio sources we find strong evidence for jet precession in 24 cases (73 per
cent). The morphology of the radio maps suggests that the precession periods
are of the order of 10^6 - 10^7 yr. We consider different explanations for the
morphological features and conclude that geodetic precession is the best
explanation. The frequently observed gradual jet angle changes in samples of
powerful blazars can be explained by orbital motion. Both observations can be
explained simultaneously by postulating that a high fraction of powerful radio
sources have sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries. We consider
complementary evidence and discuss if any jetted supermassive black hole with
some indication of precession could be detected as individual gravitational
wave source in the near future. This appears unlikely, with the possible

increase the superheating field above the maximum for superconductors in the
clean limit or with homogeneously distributed disorder. Homogeneous disorder
increases the penetration of screening current, but also suppresses the maximum
supercurrent. Inhomogeneous disorder in the form of an impurity diffusion layer
biases this trade-off by increasing the penetration of the screening currents
into cleaner regions with larger critical currents, thus limiting the
suppression of the screening current to a thin dirty region close to the

heavy Fermi liquid requires a channel symmetry breaking spinorial hybridization
that breaks both single and double time-reversal symmetry, and is known as
hastatic order. Motivated by cubic Pr-based materials with $\Gamma_3$
non-Kramers ground state doublets, this paper provides a survey of cubic
hastatic order using the simple two-channel Kondo-Heisenberg model. Hastatic
order necessarily breaks time-reversal symmetry, but the spatial arrangement of
the hybridization spinor can be either uniform (ferrohastatic) or break
additional lattice symmetries (antiferrohastatic). The experimental signatures
of both orders are presented in detail, and include tiny conduction electron
magnetic moments. Interestingly, there can be several distinct
antiferrohastatic orders with the same moment pattern that break different
lattice symmetries, revealing a potential experimental route to detect the
spinorial nature of the hybridization. We employ an SU(N) fermionic mean-field
treatment on square and simple cubic lattices, and examine how the nature and
stability of hastatic order varies as we vary the Heisenberg coupling,
conduction electron density, band degeneracies, and apply both channel and spin

Detailed spectroscopic analysis then yielded atmospheric parameters and
abundances for C, N, O, Mg and Si. Abundances were also deter- mined for V578
Mon. These results allowed a detailed comparison to the predictions of stellar
evolutionary models. No star in our sample fits its position on the
evolutionary track for its dynamical mass, leaving mass discrepancy (or
alternatively overluminosity) an open problem in theoretical modelling.
Moreover, the CNO abundances cluster around the initial values with mean values
log(N/C) = -0.56 +/- 0.06 and log(N/O) = -1.01 +/- 0.06. No trend in the CNO
abundances for single OB stars are found for the eight high-mass stars analysed
here, as well in an extended sample including literature results. This opens an
important question on the role of binarity in terms of tides on damping
internal mixing in stars residing in binary systems.

systems. To achieve a considerable speed-up, a hyper-reduction step is needed
to reduce the computational complexity due to nonlinear terms. Many
hyper-reduction techniques require the construction of nonlinear term basis,
which introduces a computationally expensive offline phase. A novel way of
constructing nonlinear term basis within the hyper-reduction process is
introduced. In contrast to the traditional hyper-reduction techniques where the
collection of nonlinear term snapshots is required, the SNS method avoids
collecting the nonlinear term snapshots. Instead, it uses the solution
snapshots that are used for building a solution basis, which enables avoiding
an extra data compression of nonlinear term snapshots. As a result, the SNS
method provides a more efficient offline strategy than the traditional model
order reduction techniques, such as the DEIM, GNAT, and ST-GNAT methods. The
SNS method is theoretically justified by the conforming subspace condition and
the subspace inclusion relation. It is useful for model order reduction of
large-scale nonlinear dynamical problems to reduce the offline cost. It is
especially useful for ST-GNAT that has shown promising results, such as a good
accuracy with a considerable online speed-up for hyperbolic problems in a
recent paper by Choi and Carlberg in SISC 2019, because ST-GNAT involves an
expensive offline cost related to collecting nonlinear term snapshots.
Numerical results support that the accuracy of the solution from the SNS method
is comparable to the traditional methods and a considerable speed-up (i.e., a
factor of two to a hundred) is achieved in the offline phase.

filamentary WHIM. Using this technique, future CMB probes (which might lower

very close to the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), in a corona of hot
electrons which up scatters optical and ultraviolet photons from the accretion
flow. The cutoff energy ($E_{\rm C}$) of the primary X-ray continuum emission
carries important information on the physical characteristics of the X-ray
emitting plasma, but little is currently known about its potential relation
with the properties of accreting SMBHs. Using the largest broad-band (0.3-150
keV) X-ray spectroscopic study available to date, we investigate how the corona
is related to the AGN luminosity, black hole mass and Eddington ratio
($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). Assuming a slab corona the median values of the
temperature and optical depth of the Comptonizing plasma are $kT_{\rm e}=105
\pm 18$ keV and $\tau=0.25\pm0.06$, respectively. When we properly account for
the large number of $E_{\rm C}$ lower limits, we find a statistically
significant dependence of the cutoff energy on the Eddington ratio. In
particular, objects with $ \lambda_{\rm Edd}>0.1$ have a significantly lower
median cutoff energy ($E_{\rm C}=160\pm41$ keV) than those with $\lambda_{\rm
Edd}\leq 0.1$ ($E_{\rm C}=370\pm51$ keV). This is consistent with the idea that
radiatively compact coronae are also cooler, because they tend to avoid the
region in the temperature-compactness parameter space where runaway pair
production would dominate. We show that this behaviour could also
straightforwardly explain the suggested positive correlation between the photon
index ($\Gamma$) and the Eddington ratio, being able to reproduce the observed
slope of the $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ trend.

powerful diagnostic tool for probing the geometry and emission processes of
unresolved sources, was obtained for this event. The observed linear
polarization was consistent with being mostly induced by intervening dust,
suggesting that the intrinsic emission was weakly polarized ($P < 0.4-0.5$ %).
In this paper, we present and discuss a detailed analysis of the linear
polarization expected from a merging NS binary system by means of 3D Monte
Carlo radiative transfer simulations assuming a range of possible

polarization originates from the non-homogeneous opacity distribution within

the merger) and in the optical R band. Smaller polarization signals are
expected at later epochs and/or different wavelengths. From the viewing-angle
dependence of the polarimetric signal, we constrain the observer orientation of
AT 2017gfo within $\sim$65$^\circ$ from the polar direction. The detection of
non-zero polarization in future events will unambiguously reveal the presence

process which assumes either a time-dependent metal outflow with larger metal
loading factors in galactic winds at early times, or a time-dependent Initial
Mass Function (IMF) with steeper slopes at early times. We compare the
predictions from this model with data sets covering redshifts 0<z<3.5. The data
suggests a two-phase evolution with a transition point around z ~ 1.5. Before
that epoch the MZRgas has been evolving parallel with no evolution in the
slope. After z ~ 1.5 the MZRgas started flattening until today. We show that
the predictions of both the variable metal outflow and the variable IMF model
match these observations very well. Our model also reproduces the evolution of
the main sequence, hence the correlation between galaxy mass and star formation
rate. We also compare the predicted redshift evolution of the MZRstar with data
from the literature. As the latter mostly contains data of massive, quenched
early-type galaxies, stellar metallicities at high redshifts tend to be higher

asymptotics. The hairy black holes have one scalar field charged under a $U(1)$
gauge field, and branch from the near-extremal Cveti\v{c}, L\""{u} and Pope
solutions. We give numerical evidence that the hairy solutions exist
arbitrarily close to the BPS bound for all charges, and saturate it in the
$T\rightarrow 0$ and $T\rightarrow\infty$ limits. We give further evidence for
the conjecture of Markevi\v{c}i\={u}t\.e and Santos, that on the BPS bound, the
rotating hairy black holes form a two-parameter family of solutions with finite
entropy, and can be regarded as a one-parameter extension of the supersymmetric
Gutowski and Reall black hole. We analyse the approach to the supersymmetric
limit and explore the full phase diagram. In the planar horizon limit we find a
two parameter family of rotating hairy black brane solutions which cannot be
obtained via a Lorentz boost. The field theory dual exhibits a spontaneously
generated current. The results of this paper suggest rich and intricate
structure of hairy black hole solutions in AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, and highlight
their importance in understanding the thermodynamics of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.

have suggested during the last four decades that quantized black holes may be
characterized by discrete radiation spectra. Bekenstein and Mukhanov (BM) have
further argued that the emission spectra of quantized $(3+1)$-dimensional
Schwarzschild black holes are expected to be sharp in the sense that the
characteristic natural broadening $\delta\omega$ of the black-hole radiation
lines, as deduced from the quantum time-energy uncertainty principle, is
expected to be much smaller than the characteristic frequency spacing
$\Delta\omega=O(T_{\text{BH}}/\hbar)$ between adjacent black-hole quantum
emission lines. It is of considerable physical interest to test the general
validity of the interesting conclusion reached by BM regarding the sharpness of
the Schwarzschild black-hole quantum radiation spectra. To this end, in the
present paper we explore the physical properties of the expected radiation
spectra of quantized $(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In
particular, we analyze the functional dependence of the characteristic
dimensionless ratio $\zeta(D)\equiv\delta\omega/\Delta\omega$ on the number
$D+1$ of spacetime dimensions. Interestingly, it is proved that the
dimensionless physical parameter $\zeta(D)$, which characterizes the sharpness
of the black-hole quantum emission spectra, is an increasing function of $D$.
In particular, we prove that the quantum emission lines of $(D+1)$-dimensional
Schwarzschild black holes in the regime $D\gtrsim 10$ are characterized by the
dimensionless ratio $\zeta(D)\gtrsim1$ and are therefore effectively blended
together.

of the three codes in terms of the SED shapes, and by comparing the derived

algorithms rely on different assumptions for star-formation history, dust

three codes show very different behavior in the mid-infrared regime, in
particular between 25 and 70 micron where there are no observational

discordant SFR estimates for galaxies with low specific SFR, and that the

AC$^0[\oplus]$ circuits; in particular, for fixed $d$, the class
$\mathcal{C}_{d,k}$ of uniform AC$^0[\oplus]$ formulas of depth $d$ and size
$n^k$ form an infinite hierarchy. For this, we find the first class of explicit
functions giving (up to polynomial factor) matching upper and lower bounds for
AC$^0[\oplus]$ formulas, derived from the $\delta$-Coin Problem, the
computational problem of distinguishing between coins that are heads with
probability $(1+\delta)/2$ or $(1-\delta)/2,$ where $\delta$ is a parameter
going to $0$. We study this problem's complexity and make progress on both
upper bounds and lower bounds.
  Upper bounds. We find explicit monotone AC$^0$ formulas solving the
$\delta$-coin problem, having depth $d$, size $\exp(O(d(1/\delta)^{1/(d-1)}))$,
and sample complexity poly$(1/\delta)$, for constant $d\ge2$. This matches
previous upper bounds of O'Donnell and Wimmer (ICALP 2007) and Amano (ICALP
2009) in terms of size and improves the sample complexity.
  Lower bounds. The upper bounds are nearly tight even for the stronger model
of AC$^0[\oplus]$ formulas (which allow NOT and Parity gates): any
AC$^0[\oplus]$ formula solving the $\delta$-coin problem must have size
$\exp(\Omega(d(1/\delta)^{1/(d-1)})).$ This strengthens a result of Cohen,
Ganor and Raz (APPROX-RANDOM 2014), who prove a similar result for AC$^0$, and
a result of Shaltiel and Viola (SICOMP 2010), who give a superpolynomially
weaker (still exponential) lower bound.
  The upper bound is a derandomization involving a use of Janson's inequality
(as far as we know, the first such use of the inequality) and classical
combinatorial designs. For the lower bound, we prove an optimal (up to constant
factor) degree lower bound for multivariate polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$
solving the $\delta$-coin problem, which may be of independent interest.

Dense Basis method of Iyer \& Gawiser (2017) for a sample of $17,873$ galaxies
at $0.5<z<6$ in the CANDELS GOODS-S field to study the nature and evolution of
the SFR-M$_*$ correlation. The reconstructed SFHs represent trajectories in
SFR-M$_*$ space, enabling us to study galaxies at epochs earlier than observed
by propagating them backwards in time along these trajectories. We study the
SFR-M$_*$ correlation at $z=1,2,3,4,5,6$ using both direct fits to galaxies
observed at those epochs and SFR-M$_*$ trajectories of galaxies observed at
lower redshifts. The SFR-M$_*$ correlations obtained using the two approaches
are found to be consistent with each other through a KS test. Validation tests
using SFHs from semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations confirm the sensitivity of the method to changes in the slope,
normalization and shape of the SFR-M$_*$ correlation. This technique allows us
to further probe the low-mass regime of the correlation at high-z by $\sim 1$
dex and over an effective volume of $\sim 10\times$ larger than possible with
just direct fits. We find that the SFR-M$_*$ correlation is consistent with
being linear down to M$_*\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ at $z>4$. The evolution of the
correlation is well described by $\log SFR= (0.80\pm 0.029 - 0.017\pm

  pitching-rolling plate",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An adjoint-based optimization is applied to study the thrust performance of a
pitching-rolling ellipsoidal plate in a uniform stream at Reynolds number 100.
To achieve the highest thrust, the optimal kinematics of pitching-rolling
motion is sought in a large control space including the pitching amplitude, the
rolling amplitude, and the phase delay between the pitching and rolling motion.
A continuous adjoint approach with boundary motion being handled by
non-cylindrical calculous is developed as a computationally efficient
optimization algorithm to deal with the large control space with morphing
domain. The comparison between the optimal motion and other reference motions
shows a significant improvement of thrust from the increase of rolling
amplitude and an optimal phase delay of $122.6^\circ$ between the pitching and
the rolling motion. The combination of these two factors impacts the overall
thrust performance through their strong effects on the angle of attack,
circulation, and the pressure distribution on the plate. Further wake structure
analysis suggests that the optimal control improves its propulsive performance
by generating a stronger leading-edge vortex (LEV) and straightening the wake
deflection.

Cas A shows a patch of diffuse emission from unshocked ejecta, as well as
brighter emission from Fast-Moving Knots and Quasi-Stationary Flocculi.
Emission at 1.64 micron is usually interpreted as [Fe II] emission, and spectra
of the bright knots confirm this by showing the expected emission in other [Fe
II] lines. We performed NIR spectroscopy on the diffuse emission region and
found that the unshocked ejecta emission does not show those lines, but rather
the [Si I] 1.607 micron line. This means that the 1.64 micron line from the
unshocked ejecta may be the [Si I] 1.645 line from the same upper level, rather
than [Fe II]. We find that the [Si I] line is formed by recombination, and we
use the [Si I] to [Si II] ratio to infer a temperature about 100 K, close to
the value assumed for analysis of low frequency radio absorption and that
inferred from emission by cool dust. Our results constrain estimates of Cas A's
total mass of unshocked ejecta that are extremely sensitive to temperature

information cascades are important problems in network science. Yet, many
studies of information cascades neglect the variation in infectivity across
different pieces of information. Here, we employ early-time observations of
online cascades to estimate the infectivity of distinct pieces of information.
Using simulations and data from real-world Twitter retweets, we demonstrate
that these estimated infectivities can be used to improve predictions about the

real-world data, we consider the effect of the limited effective time for
transmission of a cascade and demonstrate that a simple model for slow but

show that fading enhances the RFto- DC conversion efficiency of nonlinear RF

as Transmit Diversity, that relies on multiple dumb antennas at the transmitter
to induce fast fluctuations of the wireless channel. Those fluctuations boost
the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency thanks to the energy harvester nonlinearity.
In contrast with (energy) beamforming, Transmit Diversity does not rely on
Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) and does not increase the
average power at the energy harvester input, though it still enhances the
overall end-to-end power transfer efficiency. Transmit Diversity is also
combined with recently developed (energy) waveform and modulation to provide
further enhancements. The efficacy of the scheme is analyzed using
physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester
and demonstrated using circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation.
Measurements with two transmit antennas reveal gains of 50%in harvested DC
power over a single transmit antenna setup. The work (again) highlights the
crucial role played by the harvester nonlinearity and demonstrates that
multiple transmit antennas can be beneficial to WPT even in the absence of

obtained down to one milliarcsecond precision on the astrometry of these
planets. We assessed four-planet orbit models with different levels of
constraints and found that assuming the planets are near 1:2:4:8 period
commensurabilities, or are coplanar, does not worsen the fit. We added the
prior that the planets must have been stable for the age of the system (40 Myr)
by running orbit configurations from our posteriors through $N$-body
simulations and varying the masses of the planets. We found that only assuming
the planets are both coplanar and near 1:2:4:8 period commensurabilities
produces dynamically stable orbits in large quantities. Our posterior of stable
coplanar orbits tightly constrains the planets' orbits, and we discuss
implications for the outermost planet b shaping the debris disk. A four-planet
resonance lock is not necessary for stability up to now. However, planet pairs
d and e, and c and d, are each likely locked in two-body resonances for
stability if their component masses are above $6~M_{\rm{Jup}}$ and
$7~M_{\rm{Jup}}$, respectively. Combining the dynamical and luminosity
constraints on the masses using hot-start evolutionary models and a system age

for arbitrarily fast quantum non-demolition, single-quadrature measurements of

For single-qubit measurements, current measurements are limited to the 99%
fidelity range due to relaxation during the process. However, trying to go to
shorter times to circumvent this with square or composite digital pulses leads
to leftover cavity population after measurement of the same order of error.
These effects can be suppressed using simple smooth pulse shapes from a similar
family of pulses as DRAG shaping, used in the context of leakage removal in
superconducting qubits; here, it can be derived exactly for arbitrarily many
measured modes. Beyond single qubits, the measurement pulses are fully general
to dispersive measurement systems. This includes multi-qubit and multi-state

with a single homodyne phase. Another major challenge for fast measurement is
depopulating Purcell filter cavities, which we show can readily be achieved

chiral fields, we first investigate the properties of two chiral optical beams
in obtaining helicity density localization and maximization requirements. The
investigated beams include circularly polarized Gaussian beams and also an
optical beam properly composed by a combination of a radially and an
azi-muthally polarized beam. To acquire further enhancement and localization of
helicity density beyond the diffraction limit, we also study chiral fields at
the vicinity of a spherical dielectric nanoantenna and demon-strate that the
helicity density around such a nanoantenna is a superposition of helicity
density of the illu-minating field, scattered field, and an interference
helicity term. Moreover, we illustrate when the nanoan-tenna is illuminated by
a proper combination of azimuthal and radially polarized beams, the scattered
nearfields satisfy the helicity maximization conditions beyond the diffraction

and generating optimally chiral nearfield result in helici-ty enhancement which
is of great advantage in areas like detection of nanoscale chiral samples,
microsco-py, and optical manipulation of chiral nanoparticles.

transformative technologies such as autonomous vehicles and machine diagnosis;
beyond this, they also serve as candidate models for the visual system itself

principles. However, unlike human vision, CNNs can be ""fooled"" by adversarial
examples -- carefully crafted images that appear as nonsense patterns to humans
but are recognized as familiar objects by machines, or that appear as one
object to humans and a different object to machines. This seemingly extreme
divergence between human and machine classification challenges the promise of
these new advances, both as applied image-recognition systems and also as
models of the human mind. Surprisingly, however, little work has empirically
investigated human classification of such adversarial stimuli: Does human and
machine performance fundamentally diverge? Or could humans decipher such images
and predict the machine's preferred labels? Here, we show that human and
machine classification of adversarial stimuli are robustly related: In eight
experiments on five prominent and diverse adversarial imagesets, human subjects
reliably identified the machine's chosen label over relevant foils. This
pattern persisted for images with strong antecedent identities, and even for
images described as ""totally unrecognizable to human eyes"". We suggest that
human intuition may be a more reliable guide to machine (mis)classification

result for minds and machines alike.

detection and diagnosis of pathological states. In particular, quasi-static
ultrasonic (US) elastography techniques use force-displacement measurements
acquired during an US scan to parameterize the spatio-temporal stress-strain
behavior. Current methods use a model-based inverse approach to estimate the
parameters associated with a chosen constitutive model. However, model-based
methods rely on simplifying assumptions of tissue biomechanical properties,
often limiting elastography to imaging one or two linear-elastic parameters.
  We previously described a data-driven method for building neural network
constitutive models (NNCMs) that learn stress-strain relationships from
force-displacement data. Using measurements acquired on gelatin phantoms, we
demonstrated the ability of NNCMs to characterize linear-elastic mechanical
properties without an initial model assumption and thus circumvent the
mathematical constraints typically encountered in classic model-based
approaches to the inverse problem. While successful, we were required to use a
priori knowledge of the internal object shape to define the spatial
distribution of regions exhibiting different material properties.
  Here, we introduce Cartesian neural network constitutive models (CaNNCMs)
that are capable of using data to model both linear-elastic mechanical
properties and their distribution in space. We demonstrate the ability of
CaNNCMs to capture arbitrary material property distributions using
stress-strain data from simulated phantoms. Furthermore, we show that a trained
CaNNCM can be used to reconstruct a Young's modulus image. CaNNCMs are an
important step toward data-driven modeling and imaging the complex mechanical
properties of soft tissues.

disc substructures and their differences can shed light on the galaxy
assembling processes and their evolution. However, due to observational
difficulties there is a lack of information about the stellar populations of

We report that significant changes of the stellar population properties beyond
the radius where photometrical profiles demonstrate a knee are caused by an
increasing thick disc contribution. Stellar population properties in the
outermost thick-disc dominated regions demonstrate remarkably old ages and a
low metallicity. We interpret these findings as a consequence of star formation
quenching in the outermost regions of the discs due to ram pressure gas
stripping from the disc periphery at the beginning of the cluster assembly
while subsequent star formation occurring in the inner discs being gradually
extinguished by starvation.

In this work, we perform a systematic study on poisoning attacks to graph-based
recommender systems. Due to limited resources and to avoid detection, we assume
the number of fake users that can be injected into the system is bounded. The
key challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the
target item is recommended to as many normal users as possible. To address the
challenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem,
solving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose
techniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and
compare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm

its parameters are unknown), and black-box (recommendation algorithm is
unknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our
attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based

can make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain
scenarios.

This can occur, for example, when the proposed model cannot explain all the

potential by applying the method to the Kerr Hamiltonian, for which the exact
quantum evolution is punctuated by a sequence of intricate revival patterns.
The structure of such revival patterns, lying far beyond the Ehrenfest time, is
semiclassically reproduced and revealed as a consequence of constructive and
destructive interferences of classical trajectories.

distributed, renewable generation and addresses the problem of incorporating
the associated uncertainty into the optimal operation of these networks. Joint
chance constraints, which satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously with a
prescribed probability, are one way to incorporate uncertainty across sets of
constraints, leading to a chance-constrained optimal power flow problem.
Departing from the computationally-heavy scenario-based approaches or
approximations that transform the joint constraint into conservative
deterministic constraints, this paper develops a scalable, data-driven approach
which learns operational trends in a power network, eliminates zero-probability
events (e.g., inactive constraints), and accurately and efficiently
approximates bounds on the joint chance constraint iteratively. In particular,
the proposed framework improves upon the classic methods based on the union
bound (or Boole's inequality) by generating a much less conservative set of
single chance constraints that also guarantees the satisfaction of the original
joint constraint. The proposed framework is evaluated numerically using the
IEEE 37-node test feeder, focusing on the problem of voltage regulation in

curvature. While such restrictions clearly exist if $f$ is a Schwartz function,
there are few bounds available that enable one to take limits with respect to

possible to do so:
  $\bullet$ When the restriction is measured according to a Sobolev space
$H^{-s}(\Sigma)$ of negative index. We determine the complete range of indices
$(k, s, p)$ for which such a bound exists.
  $\bullet$ Among functions where $\hat{f}$ vanishes on $\Sigma$ to order
$k-1$, the restriction of $(\nabla^k) \hat{f}$ defines a bounded operator from
(this subspace of) $L_p(\mathbb R^d)$ to $L_2(\Sigma)$ provided $1 \leq p \leq
\frac{2d+2}{d+3+4k}$.
  $\bullet$ When there is _a priori_ control of $\hat{f}|_\Sigma$ in a space
$H^{\ell}(\Sigma)$, $\ell > 0$, this implies improved regularity for the
restrictions of $(\nabla^k)\hat{f}$. If $\ell$ is large enough then even
$\|\nabla \hat{f}\|_{L_2(\Sigma)}$ can be controlled in terms of
$\|\hat{f}\|_{H^\ell(\Sigma)}$ and $\|f\|_{L_p(\mathbb R^d)}$ alone.
  The techniques underlying these results are inspired by the spectral
synthesis work of Y. Domar, which provides a mechanism for $L_p$ approximation
by ""convolving along surfaces"", and the Stein-Tomas restriction theorem. Our
main inequality is a bilinear form bound with similar structure to the
Stein--Tomas $T^*T$ operator, generalized to accommodate smoothing along
$\Sigma$ and derivatives transverse to it. It is used both to establish basic
$H^{-s}(\Sigma)$ bounds for derivatives of $\hat{f}$ and to bootstrap from

continuum emission probes the bulk of the dust in vortex. Moreover, we combine
the new observations with archival data to perform a multi-wavelength analysis
and to obtain information about the dust distribution and properties inside the
asymmetry. We resolve the asymmetric disk into a symmetric ring + asymmetric
crescent, and observe that: (1) the spectral index strongly decreases at the
center of the vortex, consistent with the presence of large grains; (2) for the
first time, an azimuthal shift of the peak of the vortex with wavelength is
observed; (3) the azimuthal width of the vortex decreases at longer
wavelengths, as expected for dust traps. These features allow to confirm the
nature of the asymmetry as a vortex. Finally a lower limit to the total mass of
the vortex is $0.3 M_{\rm Jupiter}$. Considering the uncertainties involved in
this estimate, it is possible that the actual mass of the vortex is higher and
possibly within the required values ($\sim 4\,\rm M_{\rm Jupiter}$) to launch
spiral arms similar to those observed in scattered light.

While post-processing specialization methods are applicable to arbitrary

propagates the external lexical knowledge to the full distributional space. We
exploit words seen in the resources as training examples for learning a global
specialization function. This function is learned by combining a standard
L2-distance loss with an adversarial loss: the adversarial component produces
more realistic output vectors. We show the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed method across three languages and on three tasks: word similarity,
dialog state tracking, and lexical simplification. We report consistent
improvements over distributional word vectors and vectors specialized by other
state-of-the-art specialization frameworks. Finally, we also propose a

specializes a full target distributional space without any lexical knowledge in

in the 21 cm line spectrum, is a well-known characteristic of dark clouds. The
abundance of hydrogen atoms measured in the densest regions of molecular clouds
can be only explained by the dissociation of H$_2$ due to cosmic rays. We want
to assess the role of Galactic cosmic rays in the formation of atomic hydrogen,
by using recent developments in the characterisation of the low-energy spectra
of cosmic rays and advances in the modelling of their propagation in molecular
clouds. We model the attenuation of the interstellar cosmic rays entering a
cloud and compute the dissociation rate of molecular hydrogen due to collisions
with cosmic-ray protons and electrons as well as fast hydrogen atoms. We
compare our results with the available observations. The cosmic-ray
dissociation rate is entirely determined by secondary electrons produced in
primary ionisation collisions. These secondary particles constitute the only
source of atomic hydrogen at column densities above $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. We
also find that the dissociation rate decreases with column density, while the
ratio between the dissociation and ionisation rates varies between about 0.6
and 0.7. From comparison with observations we conclude that a relatively flat
spectrum of interstellar cosmic-ray protons, as the one suggested by the most
recent Voyager 1 data, can only provide a lower bound for the observed atomic
hydrogen fraction. An enhanced spectrum of low-energy protons is needed to
explain most of the observations. Our findings show that a careful description
of molecular hydrogen dissociation by cosmic rays can explain the abundance of
atomic hydrogen in dark clouds. An accurate characterisation of this process at
high densities is crucial for understanding the chemical evolution of
star-forming regions.

galaxy now has an extended dark matter profile that matches with standard

the Bondi radius. We find that the results agree reasonably well with a panoply
of observations: (1) both AGN activity and star formation are primarily in
central cold gaseous disks, are bursty and mainly driven by the Toomre
instability; (2)AGN duty cycle agrees well with the Soltan argument, i.e., the
AGN spends most of its lifetime when it is in low luminosity (half of time with
$L/L_{Edd}<7\times10^{-5}$), while emitting most of its energy when it is in
high luminosity (half of radiant energy emitted with $L/L_{Edd}>0.06$); (3) the

phenomenon. Most of the star formation occurs in the circumnuclear disk of a
size <1 kpc, which is in agreement with recent observations; (4) the ISM X-ray

discuss the nature of this spectral feature and provide convincing evidence
that it corresponds to the blue-shifted resonance doublet of singly-ionized
$^7$Be, recently discovered in other novae. During the evolution of the
outburst the appearance of an emission feature close to $\lambda$3130 is also
identified as $^7$Be II $\lambda$3132 because the usual identification as the O
III $\lambda$3133.7 Bowen fluorescence line is hardly compatible with both the
known oxygen under-abundance in the nova ejecta and the low optical depths in
the nebula due to the high outflow velocity. The average $^7$Be abundance
relative to hydrogen, estimated by four different methods, i.e. the $^7$Be II /
Mg II absorption ratio, and the $^7$Be II / Mg II, $^7$Be II / He II$_{1640}$,
and $^7$Be II / H$\beta$ emission ratios is N(Be)/N(H) $\approx$ 2.5 $\times
10^{-5}$ (by number), i.e. $\approx$ 1.7 $\times 10^{-4}$ by mass. This
corresponds to an overproduction of $^7$Be by about 1 dex in comparison with
the theoretical models of massive CO and ONe novae. Since $^7$Be all converts
into $^7$Li, the $^7$Be/H abundance implies a $^7$Li/H overabundance of about 4
dex over the $^7$/H meteoritic value and indicates a total ejected mass of
$^7$Li of $\approx$ 9.5$\times$10$^{-10}$ $M_{\odot}$. These data are in line
with previous observations and indicate that large amounts of $^7$Li can be
synthesized in a variety of novae, including very fast ONe novae.

similar periods. The extent of the instability region for models in these

static models, in agreement with previous theory. By comparing to observations,

Constructing viable search spaces in this domain is challenging because of the
multi-scale representation of visual information and the necessity to operate
on high resolution imagery. Based on a survey of techniques in dense image

over-complete dictionary for the input training data. At the deep coding layer,
a locality constraint is added to guarantee that the activated dictionary bases
are close to each other. Next, the activated dictionary atoms are assembled
together and passed to the next compound dictionary learning and coding layers.
In this way, the activated atoms in the first layer can be represented by the
deeper atoms in the second dictionary. Intuitively, the second dictionary is
designed to learn the fine-grained components which are shared among the input
dictionary atoms. In this way, a more informative and discriminative low-level

storage systems becomes increasingly important. Previous researchers have shown
that machine learning algorithms based on SMART attributes are effective
methods to predict hard drive failures. In this paper, we use SMART attributes
to predict hard drive health degrees which are helpful for taking different
fault tolerant actions in advance. Given the highly imbalanced SMART datasets,
it is a nontrivial work to predict the health degree precisely. The proposed
model would encounter overfitting and biased fitting problems if it is trained
by the traditional methods. In order to resolve this problem, we propose two
strategies to better utilize imbalanced data and improve performance. Firstly,
we design a layerwise perturbation-based adversarial training method which can
add perturbations to any layers of a neural network to improve the
generalization of the network. Secondly, we extend the training method to the
semi-supervised settings. Then, it is possible to utilize unlabeled data that
have a potential of failure to further improve the performance of the model.
Our extensive experiments on two real-world hard drive datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed schemes for both supervised and semi-supervised
classification. The model trained by the proposed method can correctly predict
the hard drive health status 5 and 15 days in advance. Finally, we verify the
generality of the proposed training method in other similar anomaly detection
tasks where the dataset is imbalanced. The results argue that the proposed
methods are applicable to other domains.

average. However, the tenuous correlation between isotropic energy and
intrinsic duration in the radio dark sample remains tenuous and is slightly

the radio dark sample, further supporting that these two samples may come from
separate progenitors. We also find that very high energy (0.1 - 100 GeV)
extended emission is only present in the radio loud sample. There is no

scale down quadratically with the reduction in precision. Here we demonstrate
ResNet-18, -34, -50, -152, Inception-v3, Densenet-161, and VGG-16bn networks on
the ImageNet classification benchmark that, at 8-bit precision exceed the
accuracy of the full-precision baseline networks after one epoch of finetuning,
thereby leveraging the availability of pretrained models. We also demonstrate
ResNet-18, -34, -50, -152, Densenet-161, and VGG-16bn 4-bit models that match
the accuracy of the full-precision baseline networks -- the highest scores to
date. Surprisingly, the weights of the low-precision networks are very close
(in cosine similarity) to the weights of the corresponding baseline networks,
making training from scratch unnecessary.
  We find that gradient noise due to quantization during training increases
with reduced precision, and seek ways to overcome this noise. The number of
iterations required by SGD to achieve a given training error is related to the
square of (a) the distance of the initial solution from the final plus (b) the
maximum variance of the gradient estimates. Therefore, we (a) reduce solution
distance by starting with pretrained fp32 precision baseline networks and
fine-tuning, and (b) combat gradient noise introduced by quantization by
training longer and reducing learning rates. Sensitivity analysis indicates
that these simple techniques, coupled with proper activation function range
calibration to take full advantage of the limited precision, are sufficient to
discover low-precision networks, if they exist, close to fp32 precision
baseline networks. The results herein provide evidence that 4-bits suffice for

power spectrum provides a quasar clustering bias measurement that is expected
to be particularly robust against systematic effects. The redshift distribution
of the quasar sample has a median redshift $z \approx 1.55$, and an effective
redshift about $1.51$. The best fit bias of the quasar sample is $b_q = 2.43

consistent with the previous literature on quasars with a similar redshift
range and selection. Since our constraint on the bias comes from the
cross-correlation between quasars and CMB lensing, we expect it to be robust to
a wide range of possible systematic effects that may contaminate the auto
correlation of quasars. We checked for a number of systematic effects from both

constraints. We study the problem of training non-convex models subject to
these rate constraints (or any non-convex and non-differentiable constraints).
In the non-convex setting, the standard approach of Lagrange multipliers may
fail. Furthermore, if the constraints are non-differentiable, then one cannot
optimize the Lagrangian with gradient-based methods. To solve these issues, we
introduce the proxy-Lagrangian formulation. This new formulation leads to an
algorithm that produces a stochastic classifier by playing a two-player
non-zero-sum game solving for what we call a semi-coarse correlated
equilibrium, which in turn corresponds to an approximately optimal and feasible
solution to the constrained optimization problem. We then give a procedure
which shrinks the randomized solution down to one that is a mixture of at most
$m+1$ deterministic solutions, given $m$ constraints. This culminates in
algorithms that can solve non-convex constrained optimization problems with
possibly non-differentiable and non-convex constraints with theoretical
guarantees. We provide extensive experimental results enforcing a wide range of
policy goals including different fairness metrics, and other goals on accuracy,
coverage, recall, and churn.

bulk Hall effect due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, as well as a chiral
magnetic effect due to inversion symmetry breaking. These unusual
electromagnetic responses can be characterized by an axion term $\theta
\textbf{E} \cdot \textbf{B}$ with space and time dependent axion angle $\theta
(\textbf{r} ,t)$. In this paper we compute the electromagnetic fields produced
by an electric charge near to a topological Weyl semimetal with two Weyl nodes
in the bulk Brillouin zone. We find that, as in ordinary metals and
dielectrics, outside the WSM the electric field is mainly determined by the
optical properties of the material. The magnetic field is, on the contrary, of
topological origin in nature due to the magnetoelectric effect of topological
phases. We show that the magnetic field exhibits a particularly interesting
behavior above the WSM: the field lines begin at the surface and then end at
the surface (but not at the same point). This behavior is quite different from
that produced by an electric charge near the surface of a topological
insulator, where the magnetic field above the surface is generated by an image
magnetic monopole beneath the surface, in which case, the magnetic field lines
are straight rays. The unconventional behavior of the magnetic field is an
experimentally observable signature of the anomalous Hall effect in the bulk of
the WSM. We discuss a simple candidate material for testing our predictions, as
well as two experimental setups which must be sensitive to the effects of the

In this version, the Table III is revised",,"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2861992",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Label information plays an important role in supervised hyperspectral image
classification problem. However, current classification methods all ignore an
important and inevitable problem---labels may be corrupted and collecting clean
labels for training samples is difficult, and often impractical. Therefore, how
to learn from the database with noisy labels is a problem of great practical
importance. In this paper, we study the influence of label noise on
hyperspectral image classification, and develop a random label propagation
algorithm (RLPA) to cleanse the label noise. The key idea of RLPA is to exploit
knowledge (e.g., the superpixel based spectral-spatial constraints) from the
observed hyperspectral images and apply it to the process of label propagation.
Specifically, RLPA first constructs a spectral-spatial probability transfer
matrix (SSPTM) that simultaneously considers the spectral similarity and
superpixel based spatial information. It then randomly chooses some training
samples as ""clean"" samples and sets the rest as unlabeled samples, and
propagates the label information from the ""clean"" samples to the rest unlabeled
samples with the SSPTM. By repeating the random assignment (of ""clean"" labeled
samples and unlabeled samples) and propagation, we can obtain multiple labels
for each training sample. Therefore, the final propagated label can be
calculated by a majority vote algorithm. Experimental studies show that RLPA
can reduce the level of noisy label and demonstrates the advantages of our
proposed method over four major classifiers with a significant margin---the
gains in terms of the average OA, AA, Kappa are impressive, e.g., 9.18%, 9.58%,

materials have surfaced. Their electronic properties can usually be well
understood without considering correlations between electrons. On the other

exotic properties and new quantum phases, for instance, high temperature
superconductivity, heavy fermions and quantum spin liquids. The study of these
phenomena has been one of the main focuses of condensed matter physics. There
is a strong incentive to introduce electronic correlations into 2D materials.
Via intercalating a van der Waals layered compound VS$_2$, we show an emergence
of a Kondo lattice, an extensively studied strongly correlated system, by
magnetic, specific heat, electrical and thermoelectric transport studies. In
particular, an exceptionally large Sommerfeld coefficient, 440
mJ$\cdot$K$^{-2}\cdot$mol$^{-1}$, indicates a strong electron correlation. The
obtained Kadowaki-Woods ratio, $2.7\times 10^{-6}$
$\mu\Omega\cdot$cm$\cdot$mol$^2\cdot$K$^2\cdot$mJ$^{-2}$, also supports the
strong electron-electron interaction. The temperature dependence of the
resistivity and thermopower corroborate the Kondo lattice picture. The
intercalated compound is one of a few rare examples of $d$-electron Kondo
lattices. We further show that the Kondo physics persists in ultra-thin films.
This work thus demonstrates a route to generate strong correlations in 2D
materials.

(also known as information design) as a source of unequal access to

a binary type for each member of a population and, based on this, produces a
signal about each member. A decision-maker infers types from signals and
accepts those individuals whose type is high in expectation. We assume the
signaler of the disadvantaged population reveals her observations to the

strategically. We study the expected utility of the populations as measured by
the fraction of accepted members, as well as the false positive rates (FPR) and
false negative rates (FNR).
  We first show the intuitive results that for a fixed environment, the
advantaged population has higher expected utility, higher FPR, and lower FNR,
than the disadvantaged one (despite having identical population quality), and
that more accurate observations improve the expected utility of the advantaged
population while harming that of the disadvantaged one. We next explore the
introduction of a publicly-observable signal, such as a test score, as a
potential intervention. Our main finding is that this natural intervention,

actually exacerbate it in settings where observations and test scores are

(MDPs) that is based on the assumption that the safety features are a priori
unknown and time-variant. In this setting, the agent explores MDPs while
constraining the probability of entering unsafe states defined by a safety
function being below a threshold. The unknown and time-variant safety values
are modeled using a spatio-temporal Gaussian process. However, there remains an
issue that an agent may have no viable action in a shrinking true safe space.
To address this issue, we formulate a problem maximizing the cumulative number
of safe states in the worst case scenario with respect to future observations.
The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated in two simulation settings,

that RW-based models are likely to generate large amounts of redundant training

tally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is
wrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.
RLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the
population of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the
strata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler
sampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new
method for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all
possible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each
partition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined
P-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE
maximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.
The audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems
in some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check
how the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison
RLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant
approaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major
changes to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the
efficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into
two strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,
and the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The
resulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.
SUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses
stratified sampling for other reasons. We provide an open-source reference
implementation and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.

to connect the shear thickening transition to the fundamental organization of
particle-interaction forces which lead to long-range organization. In
particular, at a high volume fraction of particles, recent evidence indicates
frictional forces between contacting particles is of importance. Herein, the
network of frictional contact forces is analyzed within simulated

studied to characterize the response of the contact force network (CFN) under

such structures, a reconfiguration of the charge landscape sets in at the
interface via chemical modifications, adsorbates or charge transfer. In the
latter case, one may expect a local electronic doping of one material: one
sparkling example is the two-dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) appearing in
SrTiO$_3$ once covered by a polar LaAlO$_3$ layer. Here we show that tuning the
formal polarisation of a (La,Al)$_{1-x}$(Sr,Ti)$_x$O$_3$ (LASTO:$x$) overlayer

magnetic field of superconducting field-effect devices reveals, in agreement
with $ab\ initio$ calculations and self-consistent Poisson-Schr\""odinger
modelling, that quantum confinement and energy splitting between electronic
bands of different symmetries strongly depend on interface charge densities.
These results not only strongly support the polar discontinuity mechanisms with
a full charge transfer to explain the origin of the 2DEL at the celebrated

We study here in the normal case the corresponding weight filtration by
computing the intersection complexes with respective multiplicities on the

applications in areas such as statistics, machine learning and image

problem can be modeled as a linear programming (LP) problem whose size can be
extremely large. To handle this large-scale LP, we analyse the structure of its
dual problem, which is conceivably more tractable and can be reformulated as a
well-structured convex problem with 3 kinds of block variables and a coupling
linear equality constraint. We then adapt a symmetric Gauss-Seidel based
alternating direction method of multipliers (sGS-ADMM) to solve the resulting
dual problem and establish its global convergence and global linear convergence
rate. As a critical component for efficient computation, we also show how all
the subproblems involved can be solved exactly and efficiently. This makes our
method suitable for computing a Wasserstein barycenter on a large-scale data
set, without introducing an entropy regularization term as is commonly
practiced. In addition, our sGS-ADMM can be used as a subroutine in an
alternating minimization method to compute a barycenter when its support points
are not pre-specified. Numerical results on synthetic data sets and image data
sets demonstrate that our method is highly competitive for solving large-scale
Wasserstein barycenter problems, in comparison to two existing representative
methods and the commercial software Gurobi.

  Mehta, Vikram Goyal","Extracting Fairness Policies from Legal Documents",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine Learning community is recently exploring the implications of bias and
fairness with respect to the AI applications. The definition of fairness for
such applications varies based on their domain of application. The policies
governing the use of such machine learning system in a given context are
defined by the constitutional laws of nations and regulatory policies enforced
by the organizations that are involved in the usage. Fairness related laws and
policies are often spread across the large documents like constitution,
agreements, and organizational regulations. These legal documents have long
complex sentences in order to achieve rigorousness and robustness. Automatic
extraction of fairness policies, or in general, any specific kind of policies
from large legal corpus can be very useful for the study of bias and fairness
in the context of AI applications.
  We attempted to automatically extract fairness policies from publicly
available law documents using two approaches based on semantic relatedness. The
experiments reveal how classical Wordnet-based similarity and vector-based
similarity differ in addressing this task. We have shown that similarity based
on word vectors beats the classical approach with a large margin, whereas other
vector representations of senses and sentences fail to even match the classical
baseline. Further, we have presented thorough error analysis and reasoning to
explain the results with appropriate examples from the dataset for deeper
insights.

  wireless networks",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A natural basis for the detection of a wireless random reactive jammer (RRJ)
is the perceived violation by the detector (typically located at the access
point (AP)) of the carrier sensing protocol underpinning many wireless random
access protocols (e.g., WiFi). Specifically, when the wireless medium is
perceived by a station to be busy, a carrier sensing compliant station will
avoid transmission while a RRJ station will often initiate transmission.
However, hidden terminals (HTs), i.e., activity detected by the AP but not by
the sensing station, complicate the use of carrier sensing as the basis for RRJ
detection since they provide plausible deniability to a station suspected of
being an RRJ. The RRJ has the dual objectives of avoiding detection and
effectively disrupting communication, but there is an inherent performance
tradeoff between these two objectives. In this paper we capture the behavior of
both the RRJ and the compliant stations via a parsimonious Markov chain model,
and pose the detection problem using the framework of Markov chain hypothesis
testing. Our analysis yields the receiver operating characteristic of the
detector, and the optimized behavior of the RRJ. While there has been extensive
work in the literature on jamming detection, our innovation lies in leveraging
carrier sensing as a natural and effective basis for detection.

flexibility in a heterogeneous ensemble of DERs as a Minkowski sum (M-sum) is

explain the Li-overabundances in three BHLMXBs. In this work we investigate the
evolution of low-mass pre-MS stars in binaries with a BH companion. We
calculate the evolution of the spin and orbital periods, the stellar radius and
the Roche-lobe radius during the pre-MS stage with the stellar evolution code

after the common envelope evolution and the long turnover time in the pre-MS
stars, tidal torque is not always able to synchronize the pre-MS star, so the
spin periods are generally longer than the orbital periods. Mass transfer can
occur only for stars with mass larger than $\sim 1.2M_\odot$, which experience
expansion due to nuclear reaction after the Hayashi contraction phase. The
effective temperatures and orbital periods of these systems do not match the

accuracy. However, training neural network ensembles requires a large amount of
computational resources and time. State-of-the-art approaches either train all

very small ensemble sizes in practice, or generate ensembles by training a
monolithic architecture, which results in lower model diversity and decreased
prediction accuracy. We propose MotherNets to enable higher accuracy and
practical training cost for large and diverse neural network ensembles: A
MotherNet captures the structural similarity across some or all members of a
deep neural network ensemble which allows us to share data movement and
computation costs across these networks. We first train a single or a small set
of MotherNets and, subsequently, we generate the target ensemble networks by
transferring the function from the trained MotherNet(s). Then, we continue to
train these ensemble networks, which now converge drastically faster compared
to training from scratch. MotherNets handle ensembles with diverse
architectures by clustering ensemble networks of similar architecture and
training a separate MotherNet for every cluster. MotherNets also use clustering
to control the accuracy vs. training cost tradeoff. We show that compared to
state-of-the-art approaches such as Snapshot Ensembles, Knowledge Distillation,
and TreeNets, MotherNets provide a new Pareto frontier for the
accuracy-training cost tradeoff. Crucially, training cost and accuracy
improvements continue to scale as we increase the ensemble size (2 to 3 percent
reduced absolute test error rate and up to 35 percent faster training compared
to Snapshot Ensembles). We verify these benefits over numerous neural network

attempt to reasonably explain the Lyman excess phenomenon in as many of the 67
H II regions as possible through a variety of observational and astrophysical
means including new luminosity estimates, new Herschel photometry, new distance
determinations, the use of different models for dust and ionized gas covering
factors, and the use of different stellar calibrations. This phenomenon has
been observed before; however, the objects shown to exhibit this behaviour in
the literature have decidedly different physical properties than the regions in
our sample, and thus the origin of the excess is not the same. We find that the
excess can be reproduced using OB stellar atmosphere models that have been
slightly modified in the extreme ultraviolet. Though the exact mechanism
producing the excess is still uncertain, we do find that a scaled up
magnetospheric accretion model, often used to explain similar emission from T
Tauri stars, is unable to match our observations. Our results suggest that the
Lyman excess may be associated with younger H II regions, and that it is more
commonly found in early B-type stars. Our refined sample of 24 Lyman excess H
II regions provides an ideal sample for comparative studies with regular H II
regions, and can act as the basis for the further detailed study of individual

into three types: the goal, the constraints, and uninformative phrases. Next,
we provide grounding for the extracted goal and constraint items in a dynamic
manner along with the navigation process, to deal with the target objects that
are too far away for sensor observation and the appearance of moving obstacles
like humans. In particular, for a goal phrase (e.g., ""go to the restaurant""),
we ground it to a location in a predefined semantic map and treat it as a goal
for a global motion planner, which plans a collision-free path in the workspace
for the robot to follow. For a constraint phrase (e.g., ""keep away from
people""), we dynamically add the corresponding constraint into a local planner
by adjusting the values of a local costmap according to the results returned by
the object detection module. The updated costmap is then used to compute a
local collision avoidance control for the safe navigation of the robot. By
combining natural language processing, motion planning, and computer vision,
our developed system is demonstrated to be able to successfully follow natural

Self-reference occurs on multiple timescales, from motifs to phrases to reusing
of entire sections of music, such as in pieces with ABA structure. The
Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention,
has achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require
maintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also
be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance,
however, relative timing is critically important. Existing approaches for
representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate
attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018). This is impractical
for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity
for intermediate relative information is quadratic in the sequence length. We
propose an algorithm that reduces their intermediate memory requirement to
linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a
Transformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate
minute-long compositions (thousands of steps, four times the length modeled in
Oore et al., 2018) with compelling structure, generate continuations that
coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate
accompaniments conditioned on melodies. We evaluate the Transformer with our
relative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and
Piano-e-Competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.

segmented image regions which is useful in downstream analysis. We have
validated our method on a dataset of 1487 images obtained from 15 subjects (OCT

Stronger Hardy-type paradox has been found even for the two-qubit two-setting

also find that GHZ paradox can be viewed as a perfect Hardy-type paradox.

unfavorably in system size, or are unsatisfactory in terms of accuracy.
Inspired by recent advances in statistical physics, we present a new
approximation scheme based on cluster-variational methods significantly
improving upon existing variational approximations. We can analytically
marginalize the parameters of the approximate CTBN, as these are of secondary
importance for structure learning. This recovers a scalable scheme for direct

One is to determine the thickness of mixing layers through tracking the
distributions and evolutions of the thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE)
measures; the other is to evaluate the growth rate of KHI from the slopes of
morphological functionals. Physically, it is found that the time histories of
width of mixing layer, TNE intensity, and boundary length show high correlation
and attain their maxima simultaneously. The viscosity effects are twofold,
stabilize the KHI, and enhance both the local and global TNE intensities.
Contrary to the monotonically inhibiting effects of viscosity, the heat
conduction effects firstly refrain then enhance the evolution afterwards. The
physical reasons are analyzed and presented.

coupling between high frequency optical phonons and electron as well as the low

introduction of pressure, phonon spectra has more obvious change than the

salient parts of the previous line into memory slots. By dynamic manipulation
of the memory, our model keeps a coherent information flow and learns to
express each topic flexibly and naturally. We experiment on three different
genres of Chinese poetry: quatrain, iambic and chinoiserie lyric. Both

and MAX-NAE-$k$-SAT approximation, as functions of $k$, the number of variables
$n$, and the performance ratio $\delta$. The latter problem asks for a solution
of at least $\delta$ times the optimal. Our main results include:
  (1) A deterministic algorithm for NAE-$k$-SAT that is faster than the best
deterministic algorithm for $k$-SAT on all $k \ge 3$. Previously, no
NAE-$k$-SAT algorithm is known to be faster than $k$-SAT algorithms. For $k =

is $1.328^n$.
  (2) A randomized algorithm for MAX-NAE-$k$-SAT approximation, with upper
bound $(2 - \epsilon_k(\delta))^n$ where $\epsilon_k(\delta) > 0$ only depends
on $k$ and $\delta$. Previously, no upper bound better than the trivial $2^n$
is known for MAX-NAE-$k$-SAT approximation on $k \ge 4$. For $\delta = 0.9$ and

  Our finding sheds new light on the following question: Is NAE-$k$-SAT easier
than $k$-SAT? The answer might be affirmative at least on solving the problems
exactly and deterministically, while approximately solving MAX-NAE-$k$-SAT
might be harder than MAX-$k$-SAT on $k \ge 4$.

whole arm manipulation (WAM). This type of manipulation places the load on the
robot's arms and relies on global properties of the interaction to
succeed---rather than local contacts such as grasping or non-prehensile
pushing. In this paper, we learn to generate motions that enable WAM for
holding and transporting of humans in certain rescue or patient care scenarios.
We model the task as a reinforcement learning problem in order to provide a
behavior that can directly respond to external perturbation and human motion.
For this, we represent global properties of the robot-human interaction with
topology-based coordinates that are computed from arm and torso positions.
These coordinates also allow transferring the learned policy to other body
shapes and sizes. For training and evaluation, we simulate a dynamic sea rescue
scenario and show in quantitative experiments that the policy can solve unseen
scenarios with differently-shaped humans, floating humans, or with perception
noise. Our qualitative experiments show the subsequent transporting after
holding is achieved and we demonstrate that the policy can be directly
transferred to a real world setting.

a reformulation of the governing equations. The equations are reformulated as a

clear bimodality in stellar age and metallicity within the population of S0s
and this is strongly correlated with stellar mass. Old and metal-rich bulges
and disks belong to massive galaxies, and young and metal-poor bulges and disks
are hosted by low-mass galaxies. From this we conclude that the bulges and
disks are co-evolving. When the bulge and disk stellar ages are compared, we
find that the bulge is almost always older than the disk for massive galaxies
($\textrm{M}_{\star} > 10^{10}~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$). The opposite is true for
lower mass galaxies. We conclude that we see two separate populations of
lenticular galaxies. The old, massive, and metal-rich population possess bulges
that are predominantly older than their disks, which we speculate may have been
caused by morphological or inside-out quenching. In contrast, the less massive
and more metal-poor population have bulges with more recent star formation than
their disks. We postulate they may be undergoing bulge rejuvenation (or disk
fading), or compaction. Environment doesn't play a distinct role in the
properties of either population. Our findings give weight to the notion that
while the faded spiral scenario likely formed low-mass S0s, other processes,
such as mergers, may be responsible for high-mass S0s.

low, compact algorithms purposely employ simple probabilistic models that can
be described with a small number of parameters. Despite their simplicity,
compact algorithms have shown good performances on a broad range of benchmark
functions and real-world problems. However, compact algorithms also come with
some drawbacks, i.e. they tend to premature convergence and show poorer
performance on non-separable problems. To overcome these limitations, here we
investigate a possible algorithmic scheme obtained by combining compact
algorithms with a non-disruptive restart mechanism taken from the literature,
named Re-Sampled Inheritance (RI). The resulting compact algorithms with RI are
tested on the CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The numerical results show on the

Question Answering (VQA). In its standard form, the VQA task is operationalized
as follows: Given an image and an open-ended question in natural language,
systems are required to provide a suitable answer. Currently, model performance
is evaluated by means of a somehow simplistic metric: If the predicted answer
is chosen by at least 3 human annotators out of 10, then it is 100% correct.
Though intuitively valuable, this metric has some important limitations. First,
it ignores whether the predicted answer is the one selected by the Majority
(MA) of annotators. Second, it does not account for the quantitative
Subjectivity (S) of the answers in the sample (and dataset). Third, information
about the Semantic Similarity (SES) of the responses is completely neglected.
Based on such limitations, we propose a multi-component metric that accounts
for all these issues. We show that our metric is effective in providing a more
fine-grained evaluation both on the quantitative and qualitative level.

photospheric composition. Elements with low first ionization potential (FIP)
appear enhanced compared to O in the solar wind relative to the respective
photospheric abundances. This so-called FIP effect is different in the slow
solar wind and the coronal hole wind. However, under the same plasma
conditions, for elements with similar FIPs such as Mg, Si, and Fe, comparable
enhancements are expected. We scrutinize the assumption that the FIP effect is
always similar for different low FIP elements, namely Mg, Si, and Fe. We
investigate the dependency of the FIP effect of low FIP elements on the O7+/O6+
charge state ratio depending on time and solar wind type. We order the observed
FIP ratios with respect to the O7+/O6+ charge state ratio into bins and analyze
separately the respective distributions of the FIP ratio of Mg, Si, and Fe for
each O7+/O6+ charge state ratio bin. We observe that the FIP effect shows the
same qualitative yearly behavior for Mg and Si, while Fe shows significant
differences during the solar activity maximum and its declining phase. In each
year, the FIP effect for Mg and Si always increases with increasing O7+/O6+
charge state ratio, but for high O7+/O6+ charge state ratios the FIP effect for
Fe shows a qualitatively different behavior. During the years 2001-2006,
instead of increasing with the O7+/O6+ charge state ratio, the Fe FIP ratio
exhibits a broad peak. Also, the FIP distribution per O7+/O6+ charge state bin
is significantly broader for Fe than for Mg and Si. These observations support
the conclusion that the elemental fractionation is only partly determined by
FIP. In particular, the qualitative difference behavior with increasing O7+/O6+
charge state ratio between Fe on the one hand and Mg and Si on the other hand
is not yet well explained by models of fractionation.

time-course expression trajectories exhibit periodic oscillations with a period
of approximately 24 hours. Such genes are usually referred to as circadian, and
their identification is a crucial step toward discovering physiological
processes that are clock-controlled. It is natural to expect that the
expression of gene i at time j might depend to some degree on the expression of
the other genes measured at the same time. However, widely-used rhythmicity
detection techniques do not accommodate for the potential dependence across
genes. We develop a Bayesian approach for periodicity identification that
explicitly takes into account the complex dependence structure across
time-course trajectories in gene expressions. We employ a latent factor
representation to accommodate dependence, while representing the true
trajectories in the Fourier domain allows for inference on period, phase, and
amplitude of the signal. Identification of circadian genes is allowed through a
carefully chosen variable selection prior on the Fourier basis coefficients.
The methodology is applied to a novel mouse liver circadian dataset. Although
motivated by time-course gene expression array data, the proposed approach is
applicable to the analysis of dependent functional data at broad.

present higher treatment efficacy for the same level of toxicity. We are
particularly interested in the setting where it is necessary to wait a few
cycles of therapy to observe an efficacy outcome and the phase I and II

these circumstances, it is common practice to implement two-stage designs where
a set of maximum tolerated dose combinations is selected in a first stage, and
then studied in a second stage for treatment efficacy. In this article we
present a new two-stage design for early phase clinical trials with drug
combinations. In the first stage, binary toxicity data is used to guide the
dose escalation and set the maximum tolerated dose combinations. In the second
stage, we take the set of maximum tolerated dose combinations recommended from
the first stage, which remains fixed along the entire second stage, and through
adaptive randomization, we allocate subsequent cohorts of patients in dose

from NSBH mergers contain information about the components' masses and spins as
well as the NS equation of state. Extracting this information requires
comparison of the signal in noisy detector data with theoretical templates
derived from some combination of post-Newtonian (PN) approximants, effective
one-body (EOB) models and %analytic fits to numerical relativity (NR)
simulations. The accuracy of these templates is limited by errors in the NR
simulations, by the approximate nature of the PN/EOB waveforms, and by the
hybridization procedure used to combine them. In this paper, we estimate the
impact of these errors by constructing and comparing a set of PN-NR hybrid
waveforms, for the first time with NR waveforms from two different codes,
namely, SpEC and SACRA, for such systems. We then attempt to recover the
parameters of the binary using two non-precessing template approximants. We
find that systematic errors are too large for tidal effects to be accurately

biomolecular electrostatic and ion channel models. However, large biomolecules
and/or fine grid resolutions give rise to excessively large memory requirements
in ESES construction. We introduce an out-of-core and parallel algorithm to
improve the ESES software.
  Results: The present approach drastically improves the spatial and temporal
efficiency of ESES. The memory footprint and time complexity are analyzed and
empirically verified through extensive tests with a large collection of
biomolecule examples. Our results show that our algorithm can successfully
reduce memory footprint through a straightforward divide-and-conquer strategy
to perform the calculation of arbitrarily large proteins on a typical commodity
personal computer. On multi-core computers or clusters, our algorithm can
reduce the execution time by parallelizing most of the calculation as disjoint
subproblems. Various comparisons with the state-of-the-art Cartesian grid based
SES calculation were done to validate the present method and show the improved
efficiency. This approach makes ESES a robust software for the construction of
analytical solvent excluded surfaces.

user employs a power splitting (PS) based simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) technique. The transmitter intends to send confidential
information to its legitimate users in the presence of purely unknown
eavesdroppers. Since the transmitter does not have any knowledge of the
eavesdroppers' channel state information (CSI), we consider an artificial noise
(AN) approach to establishing secure communication. This beamforming design is
developed by maximizing the AN power to interfere with the eavesdropper as much
as possible. Based on the assumption of imperfect CSI of legitimate users at
the transmitter, two robust design approaches for the joint beamforming and PS
ratio have been studied to maximize the AN power under both energy harvesting
(EH) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at each
legitimate user. In the first robust design, we consider the bounded channel
uncertainties, and employ semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and a linear matrix
inequality (LMI) representation to transform the original problem into a
semidefinite program (SDP). In the second robust design, we consider the
statistical channel uncertainties, and show that the proposed problem can be
reformulated into another form of SDP through both SDR and Bernstein-type
inequality. In addition, the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model is
incorporated in this work as it could reflect the characteristics of practical
radio frequency(RF)-EH conversion circuit. Simulation results have been

another type of resource augmentation by allocating additional processors, a

Comparison studies of Sun-like stars with the Sun suggest an

We investigate the effect of metallicity and effective temperature on the
photometric brightness change of Sun-like stars seen at different inclinations.
The considered range of fundamental stellar parameters is sufficiently small so
the stars, investigated here, still count as Sun-like or even as solar twins.
Methods. To model the brightness change of stars with solar magnetic activity,
we extend a well established model of solar brightness variations, SATIRE
(which stands for Spectral And Total Irradiance Reconstruction), which is based
on solar spectra, to stars with different fundamental parameters. For that we
calculate stellar spectra for different metallicities and effective temperature
using the radiative transfer code ATLAS9. Results. We show that even a small
change (e.g. within the observational error range) of metallicity or effective
temperature significantly affects the photometric brightness change compared to
the Sun. We find that for Sun-like stars, the amplitude of the brightness
variations obtained for Str\""omgren (b + y)/2 reaches a local minimum for
fundamental stellar parameters close to the solar metallicity and effective
temperature. Moreover, our results show that the effect of inclination
decreases for metallicity values greater than the solar metallicity. Overall,
we find that an exact determination of fundamental stellar parameters is
crucially important for understanding stellar brightness changes.

paradigm which lies between direct and representative democracy. One main
feature of liquid democracy is that voters can delegate their votes in a
transitive manner so that: A delegates to B and B delegates to C leads to A
delegates to C. Unfortunately, this process may not converge as there may not
even exist a stable state (also called equilibrium). In this paper, we
investigate the stability of the delegation process in liquid democracy when
voters have restricted types of preference on the agent representing them

preferences guarantee the existence of an equilibrium and we obtain both
tractability and hardness results for the problem of computing several
equilibria with some desirable properties.

  combinatorial optimization","15 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A combinatorial optimization problem (COP) has a finite groundset
$E(\left|E\right|=N$), a weight vector $c=\left(c^e:e\in E\right)$ and a family
$T\in E$ of feasible subsets with objective to find $t\in T$ with maximal
weight: ${max}\{\sum_{e\in t}c^e$: $t\in T\}$. Polyhedral combinatorics
reformulates combinatorial optimization as linear program: $T$ is mapped into
the set $X\in R^N$ of 0/1 incidence vectors and $c\in R^N$ is maximized over
the convex hull of $X$: ${max}\{cx: x\in conv(X)\}$. In theory, complementary
slackness conditions for the induced linear program provide optimality
conditions for the COP. However, in general case, optimality conditions for
combinatorial optimization have not been formulated analytically as for many
problems complete description of the induced polytopes is available only as a
convex hull of extreme points rather than a system of linear inequalities.
Here, we formulate optimality conditions for a COP in general case: $x_k\in X\
\ $is optimal if and only if $c\in cone\left(H_k\right)\ $ where $H_k$ $=\{h\in
V:\ {hx}_k\ \ge hx$ for all $x\in X\}$ and $V$ is the set of all -1/0/1 valued
vectors in $R^N$. This provides basis to get, in theory, a complete description
of a combinatorial polytope induced by any COP: all facet inducing inequalities
for $conv(X)$ can be written as $hx\le l$ where $h\in V$ and $l$ is integer. A
vector $h\in V$ induces a nonredundent facet if and only if $h\in H_k^o$ $\in
H_k$ for at least one $x_k\in X\ $(where $H_k^o$$=\{h\in H_k:h\notin
cone(H_k\setminus \{h\})\}$ ) and $l=\ $ $x_kh$.

PAD method operating in an open-set mode, capable of correctly discerning 100%
of fake thermal samples, achieving Attack Presentation Classification Error

to 0%, which can be easily implemented into any existing system as a separate

the system that reaches a depth of nearly 50% and has a total duration of 1.7
days, longer than for any previously known third-body eclipse involving
unevolved stars. The binary eclipses exhibit clear eclipse timing variations. A
combination of photodynamical modeling of the lightcurve, as well as seven
follow-up radial velocity measurements, has led to a prediction of the
subsequent eclipses of the third star with a period of 188 days. A campaign of
follow-up ground-based photometry was able to capture the subsequent pair of

Reversibility from Ordinal Patterns method (TiROP) to assess time-reversibility

$k+1\le d \le k+r-1$, where $d$ denotes the number of non-failed columns that
are connected for repair; note that when $d<k+r-1$, some of the chosen $d$
columns in repairing a failed column are specific. In addition, we show how our
transformation framework applies to an example of binary MDS array codes with
asymptotically optimal repair access of any single information column and
enables asymptotically or exactly optimal repair access for any column.
Furthermore, we present a new transformation for EVENODD codes with two parity
columns such that the existing efficient repair property of any information
column is preserved and the repair access of parity column is optimal.

spinors. These spinors are related to Elko (flag-pole spinors) by a
one-parameter matrix transformation $\mathcal{Z}(z)$ where $z$ is a complex
number. The theory is non-local and non-covariant. While it is possible to
obtain a Lorentz-invariant theory via $\tau$-deformation, we choose to study
the effects of non-locality and non-covariance. Our motivation for doing so is
explained. We show that a fermionic field with $|z|\neq1$ and $|z|=1$ are
physically equivalent. But for fermionic fields with more than one value of
$z$, their interactions are $z$-dependent thus introducing an additional
fermionic degeneracy that is absent in the Lorentz-invariant theory. We study
the fermionic self-interaction and the local $U(1)$ interaction. In the
process, we obtained non-local contributions for fermionic self-interaction
that have previously been neglected. For the local $U(1)$ theory, the
interactions contain time derivatives that renders the interacting density
non-commutative at space-like separation. We show that this problem can be
resolved by working in the temporal gauge. This issue is also discussed in the
context of gravity.

is to combine two simple grippers -- an inner gripper which is used for precise

robotic hands require complicated compliant mechanisms or complicated control
strategy and force sensing to conduct assemble tasks, which makes them costly
and difficult to pick and arrange small objects like screws or washers.
Compared to the conventional hands, the proposed design provides a low-cost
solution for aligning, picking up, and arranging various objects by taking
advantages of the geometric constraints of the positioning fingers and gravity.
It is able to deal with small screws and washers, and eliminate the position
errors of cylindrical objects or objects with cylindrical holes. In the
experiments, both real-world tasks and quantitative analysis are performed to
validate the aligning, picking, and arrangements abilities of the design.

and participate in public debates. However, to enable a healthy environment for
information sharing, social deliberation, and opinion formation, citizens need
to be exposed to sufficiently diverse viewpoints that challenge their
assumptions, instead of being trapped inside filter bubbles. In this paper, we
take a step in this direction and propose a novel approach to maximize the
diversity of exposure in a social network. We formulate the problem in the
context of information propagation, as a task of recommending a small number of
news articles to selected users. We propose a realistic setting where we take
into account content and user leanings, and the probability of further sharing
an article. This setting allows us to capture the balance between maximizing
the spread of information and ensuring the exposure of users to diverse
viewpoints.
  The resulting problem can be cast as maximizing a monotone and submodular
function subject to a matroid constraint on the allocation of articles to
users. It is a challenging generalization of the influence maximization
problem. Yet, we are able to devise scalable approximation algorithms by
introducing a novel extension to the notion of random reverse-reachable sets.

networks (SPNs), a recently proposed tractable probabilistic model allowing
exact and efficient inference. In particular, by using GPs as leaves of an SPN
we obtain a novel flexible prior over functions, which implicitly represents an
exponentially large mixture of local GPs. Exact and efficient posterior
inference in this model can be done in a natural interplay of the inference
mechanisms in GPs and SPNs. Thereby, each GP is -- similarly as in a mixture of
experts approach -- responsible only for a subset of data points, which
effectively reduces inference cost in a divide and conquer fashion. We show
that integrating GPs into the SPN framework leads to a promising probabilistic
regression model which is: (1) computational and memory efficient, (2) allows
efficient and exact posterior inference, (3) is flexible enough to mix
different kernel functions, and (4) naturally accounts for non-stationarities

nuclear phenomena are related to the deformation of intrinsic states. Their
accurate modeling relies on the correct description of the change of nuclear
binding energy with deformation. The two most important contributions to the
deformation energy have their origin in shell effects that are correlated to
the spectrum of single-particle states, and the deformability of nuclear
matter, that can be characterized by a model-dependent surface energy
coefficient a_{surf}.
  With the goal of improving the global performance of nuclear EDFs through
fine-tuning of their deformation properties, the purpose of this study is
threefold. First, to analyze the impact of systematic variations of a_{surf} on
properties of nuclei; second, to identify observables that can be safely used
to narrow down the range of appropriate values of a_{surf} to be targeted in
future parameter fits; third, to analyze the interdependence of a_{surf} with
other properties of a nuclear EDF.
  Results for a large variety of relevant observables of deformed nuclei
obtained from self-consistent mean-field calculations with a set of
purpose-built SLy5sX parameterizations of the Skyrme EDF are correlated with
the value of a_{surf}.
  The three main conclusions are that there is an evident preference for a
comparatively low value of a_{surf}, as expected from the performance of
existing parameterizations; that the isospin dependence of the surface energy
also needs further finetuning in order to describe trends across the chart of
nuclei; and that a satisfying simultaneous description of fission barriers and
superdeformed states requires a better description of the single-particle
spectra.

overcome this, we suggest the use of weakly informative priors (WIP) for the

seen as a form of penalization. As a data model, we use a binomial-normal
hierarchical model (BNHM) which does not require continuity corrections in case
of zero counts in one or both arms. We suggest a normal prior for the log odds

symmetric prior centred around unity and constraining the odds ratio to within
a range from 1/250 to 250 with 95 % probability, and (2) as consistent with
empirically observed effect estimates from a set of $\mbox{$37\,773$}$
meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In a simulation
study with rare events and few studies, our BNHM with a WIP outperformed a
Bayesian method without a WIP and a maximum likelihood estimator in terms of
smaller bias and shorter interval estimates with similar coverage. Furthermore,
the methods are illustrated by a systematic review in immunosuppression of rare
safety events following paediatric transplantation. A publicly available

here that this instability presents an analogous core--halo structure as its

the former case the core is dominated by the gravitation of thermal energy and
not rest mass energy. A relativistic generalization of Antonov's

turning points, which make themselves evident as a double spiral of the caloric
curve, approach each other as relativistic effects become more intense and
eventually merge in a single point. Thus, the high and low-energy cases may be
realized as two aspects of a single phenomenon---the gravothermal
instability---which involves a core--halo separation and an intrinsic heat
flow. Finally, I argue that the core formed during a core-collapse supernova is
subject to the relativistic gravothermal instability if it becomes sufficiently
hot and compactified at the time of the bounce. In this case, it will continue

its delocalized electron density that can respond to extremely small external
perturbations such as electric field or temperature gradient. In energy space,
the quantum states of the conduction electrons cross over the metal's Fermi
energy continuously. But when gold is dispersed in finite nanometer-size
particles or 'clusters', the delocalized electronic states are re-grouped in
energy space to 'shells' according to allowed energy levels and the symmetry
and shape of the atomic arrangement. This re-grouping generates also an energy
gap in the vicinity of the Fermi energy akin to the energy gap between occupied
and unoccupied electron orbitals in molecules. How does the formation of these
shells and the energy gap affect the physico-chemical properties of the
nanoparticle? How does one get from a 'molecule-like' gold nanoparticle to
'metal-like' gold nanoparticle? Here we analyse the electronic structure and
optical and chiroptical properties of recently reported gold nanoparticles of
144, 146, and 246 gold atoms, that are made by wet chemistry methods and whose
structures have been resolved to atomic precision. We demonstrate
computationally how re-grouping of the quantum states of valence electrons can
affect drastically the optical properties of nanoparticles in the
crossover-size region, by either generating a multi-band molecule-like or a
monotonous metallic optical absorption. The lower the symmetry of the gold
core, the more metallic is the nanoparticle. The underlying mechanism arises
from symmetry-sensitive distribution of the electronic levels of the
nanoparticle close to Fermi energy. Overall, this work sheds lights on
fundamental mechanisms on how molecular nanoparticle properties can change
metallic in the crossover-size region.

consider that users' data available for training wholly characterizes their

evaluate their privacy properties with these same data. In this paper, we aim
to understand the impact of this decision on the level of privacy these LPPMs
may offer in real life when the users' mobility data may be different from the
data used in the design phase. Our results show that, in many cases, training
data does not capture users' behavior accurately and, thus, the level of
privacy provided by the LPPM is often overestimated. To address this gap
between theory and practice, we propose to use blank-slate models for LPPM
design. Contrary to the hardwired approach, that assumes known users' behavior,
blank-slate models learn the users' behavior from the queries to the service
provider. We leverage this blank-slate approach to develop a new family of
LPPMs, that we call Profile Estimation-Based LPPMs. Using real data, we
empirically show that our proposal outperforms optimal state-of-the-art
mechanisms designed on sporadic hardwired models. On non-sporadic location
privacy scenarios, our method is only better if the usage of the location
privacy service is not continuous. It is our hope that eliminating the need to
bootstrap the mechanisms with training data and ensuring that the mechanisms

proposes a novel RSA method called gradient-based RSA (GRSA). Moreover, the
proposed method is not restricted to a linear model. In fact, there is a
growing interest in finding more effective ways of using multi-subject and

organs at risk (OARs). This planning process can delay treatment, while also
introducing inter-operator variability with resulting downstream radiation dose
differences. While auto-segmentation algorithms offer a potentially time-saving
solution, the challenges in defining, quantifying and achieving expert
performance remain. Adopting a deep learning approach, we demonstrate a 3D
U-Net architecture that achieves expert-level performance in delineating 21
distinct head and neck OARs commonly segmented in clinical practice. The model
was trained on a dataset of 663 deidentified computed tomography (CT) scans
acquired in routine clinical practice and with both segmentations taken from
clinical practice and segmentations created by experienced radiographers as
part of this research, all in accordance with consensus OAR definitions. We
demonstrate the model's clinical applicability by assessing its performance on
a test set of 21 CT scans from clinical practice, each with the 21 OARs
segmented by two independent experts. We also introduce surface Dice similarity
coefficient (surface DSC), a new metric for the comparison of organ
delineation, to quantify deviation between OAR surface contours rather than
volumes, better reflecting the clinical task of correcting errors in the
automated organ segmentations. The model's generalisability is then
demonstrated on two distinct open source datasets, reflecting different centres
and countries to model training. With appropriate validation studies and
regulatory approvals, this system could improve the efficiency, consistency,
and safety of radiotherapy pathways.

we use an interaction in a large configuration space that reproduces the
spectroscopy of nuclei in this mass region. For the dominant transition to the
$^{124}$Te ground state, we find half-lives $T^{2\nu{\rm

a half-life almost entirely consistent with present experimental limits and
largely within the reach of ongoing experiments. The shell model half-life
range overlaps with the ET, but extends less beyond current limits. Our
findings thus suggest that the two-neutrino double electron capture on

autoencoder (FHVAE) model to learn an unsupervised latent representation for
dialect identification (DID). An FHVAE can learn a latent space that separates
the more static attributes within an utterance from the more dynamic attributes
by encoding them into two different sets of latent variables. Useful factors
for dialect identification, such as phonetic or linguistic content, are encoded
by a segmental latent variable, while irrelevant factors that are relatively
constant within a sequence, such as a channel or a speaker information, are
encoded by a sequential latent variable. The disentanglement property makes the
segmental latent variable less susceptible to channel and speaker variation,
and thus reduces degradation from channel domain mismatch. We demonstrate that
on fully-supervised DID tasks, an end-to-end model trained on the features
extracted from the FHVAE model achieves the best performance, compared to the
same model trained on conventional acoustic features and an i-vector based
system. Moreover, we also show that the proposed approach can leverage a large
amount of unlabeled data for FHVAE training to learn domain-invariant features
for DID, and significantly improve the performance in a low-resource condition,
where the labels for the in-domain data are not available.

star-forming molecular clouds in five far-infrared bands with the aim of
compiling complete census of prestellar cores and young, embedded protostars.
In this paper, we present the catalogue of the dense cores and YSOs/protostars
extracted from the Herschel maps of the Lupus I, III, and IV molecular clouds.
The physical properties of the detected objects were derived by fitting their
spectral energy distributions. A total of 532 dense cores, out of which 103 are
presumably prestellar in nature, and 38 YSOs/protostars have been detected in
the three clouds. Almost all the prestellar cores are associated with filaments
against only about one third of the unbound cores and YSOs/protostars.
Prestellar core candidates are found even in filaments that are on average
thermally sub-critical and over a background column density lower than that
measured in other star forming regions so far. The core mass function of the
prestellar cores peaks between 0.2 and 0.3 solar masses and it is compatible
with the log-normal shape found in other regions. Herschel data reveal several,
previously undetected, protostars and new candidates of Class 0 and Class II
with transitional disks. We estimate the evolutionary status of the
YSOs/protostars using two independent indicators: the $\alpha$ index and the
fitting of the spectral energy distribution from near- to far-infrared
wavelengths. For 70% of the objects, the evolutionary stages derived with the
two methods are in agreement. Lupus is confirmed to be a very low-mass
star-forming region, both in terms of the prestellar condensations and of the
diffuse medium. Noticeably, in the Lupus clouds we have found star formation
activity associated with interstellar medium at low column density, usually
quiescent in other (more massive) star forming regions.

neural networks performing depth prediction from a single image, and then of
the usability of recently published works on unsupervised learning of depth
from videos. To overcome their limitations, we propose to learn in the same
unsupervised manner a depth map inference system from monocular videos that
takes a pair of images as input. This algorithm actually learns
structure-from-motion from motion, and not only structure from context
appearance. The scale factor issue is explicitly treated, and the absolute
depth map can be estimated from camera displacement magnitude, which can be
easily measured from cheap external sensors. Our solution is also much more
robust with respect to domain variation and adaptation via fine tuning, because
it does not rely entirely in depth from context. Two use cases are considered,
unstabilized moving camera videos, and stabilized ones. This choice is
motivated by the UAV (for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) use case that generally
provides reliable orientation measurement. We provide a set of experiments
showing that, used in real conditions where only speed can be known, our
network outperforms competitors for most depth quality measures. Results are

in a second quantization approach in order to deal with the canonical ensemble.
Having been applied earlier to handle various problems in nuclear physics that
involve fixed particle numbers, the projector formalism was extended to grant
access as well to quantum-statistical averages in condensed matter physics,
such as particle densities and correlation functions. In this light, the
occupation numbers of the subsequent single-particle energy eigenstates are key
quantities to be examined. The goal of this paper is 1) to provide a sound
extension of the projector formalism directly addressing the occupation numbers
as well as the chemical potential, and 2) to demonstrate how the emerging
problems related to numerical instability for fermions can be resolved to
obtain the canonical statistical quantities for both fermions and bosons.

algorithms capable of exceeding human performance on specific tasks. These
algorithms are mostly trained one task at the time, each new task requiring to
train a brand new agent instance. This means the learning algorithm is general,
but each solution is not; each agent can only solve the one task it was trained
on. In this work, we study the problem of learning to master not one but
multiple sequential-decision tasks at once. A general issue in multi-task
learning is that a balance must be found between the needs of multiple tasks
competing for the limited resources of a single learning system. Many learning
algorithms can get distracted by certain tasks in the set of tasks to solve.
Such tasks appear more salient to the learning process, for instance because of
the density or magnitude of the in-task rewards. This causes the algorithm to
focus on those salient tasks at the expense of generality. We propose to
automatically adapt the contribution of each task to the agent's updates, so
that all tasks have a similar impact on the learning dynamics. This resulted in
state of the art performance on learning to play all games in a set of 57
diverse Atari games. Excitingly, our method learned a single trained policy -
with a single set of weights - that exceeds median human performance. To our
knowledge, this was the first time a single agent surpassed human-level
performance on this multi-task domain. The same approach also demonstrated
state of the art performance on a set of 30 tasks in the 3D reinforcement

through unitary block-diagonalization (SSUB) applied to a Fock operator. Our
separation can be formulated in a very general way. It can be applied to very
different partitionings ranging from those driven by features in the molecular
structure (such as a solute surrounded by solvent molecules) to those that aim
at an orbital separation (such as core-valence separation). Our framework
embraces recent developments of Manby and Miller as well as older ones of
Huzinaga and Cantu. Projector-based embedding is simplified and accelerated by
SSUB. Moreover, it directly relates to decoupling approaches for relativistic
four-component many-electron theory. For a Fock operator based on the Dirac
one-electron Hamiltonian, one would like to separate the so-called positronic
(negative-energy) states from the electronic bound and continuum states. The
exact two-component (X2C) approach developed for this purpose becomes a special
case of the general SSUB framework and may therefore be viewed as a
system-environment decoupling approach. Moreover, for SSUB there exists no
restriction with respect to the number of subsystems that are generated - in
the limit, decoupling of all single-particle states is recovered, which
represents exact diagonalization of the problem. The fact that a Fock operator
depends on its eigenvectors poses challenges to all system-environment
decoupling approaches and is discussed in terms of the SSUB framework. Apart
from improved conceptual understanding, these relations bring about technical
advances as developments in different fields can immediately cross-fertilize
one another. As an important example we discuss the atomic decomposition of the
unitary block-diagonalization matrix in X2C-type approaches that can inspire
approaches for the efficient partitioning of large total systems based on SSUB.

emerging from atomic and photonic systems, and offer the prospect of designing
interactions between particles. The shape of the potential, besides playing an
important role in the competition between different fractional quantum Hall
phases, can also trigger the transition to symmetry-broken phases, or even to
phases where topological and symmetry-breaking order coexist. Here, we explore
the phase diagram of an interacting bosonic model in the lowest Landau level at
half-filling as two-body interactions are tuned. Apart from the well-known
Laughlin liquid, Wigner crystal phase, stripe, and bubble phases, we also find
evidence of a phase that exhibits crystalline order at fractional filling per
crystal site. The Laughlin liquid transits into this phase when pairs of bosons
strongly repel each other at relative angular momentum $4\hbar$. We show that
such interactions can be achieved by dressing ground-state cold atoms with
multiple different-parity Rydberg states.

However, online treatment suffers from high drop-out rates, which might negate

we propose the Super-Resolution CliqueNet (SRCliqueNet) to reconstruct the high

proposed SRCliqueNet firstly extracts a set of feature maps from the low

clique up-sampling module consists of four sub-nets which predict the high

feature properties of four sub-bands, the four sub-nets are connected to the
others so that they can learn the coefficients of four sub-bands jointly.
Finally we apply inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) to the output of
four sub-nets at the end of the clique up-sampling module to increase the
resolution and reconstruct the HR image. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves superior
performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

commonly understood to be a discipline concerned with the analysis and
characterization of the vibratory response of structures. Key elements of the
response are the amplitude, phase, and damping ratio, which are quantities that
vary with the excitation frequency. In this paper, we extend the discipline of
structural dynamics to the realm of materials engineering by intrinsically
building localized substructures within, or attached to, the material domain
itself$-$which is viewed as an extended medium without defined external
boundaries. Our system is essentially a locally resonant elastic metamaterial,
except here it is viewed from the perspective of unique dissipation
characteristics rather than subwavelength effective properties or band gaps, as
widely done in the literature. We provide a theory, validated by experiments,
for substructurally synthesizing the dissipation under the conditions of
free-wave motion, i.e., waves not constrained to a prescribed driving
frequency. We use an extended elastic beam with attached pillars as an example
of a metamaterial. When compared to an identical infinite beam with no attached
substructures, we show that within certain frequency ranges the metamaterial
exhibits either enhanced or reduced dissipation$-$which we refer to as positive
and negative metadamping, respectively. These regimes are rigorously identified
and characterized using the metamaterial's band structure and
wavenumber-dependent dissipation diagram. This theory impacts applications that
require a combination of high stiffness and high damping or, conversely,
applications that benefit from a reduction in loss without the need to change
the backbone constituent material.

a positive term in the extraordinary Hall effect coefficient and modifies the

remanence of hysteresis loops. Hydrogen sensitive compositions are within the
Co concentration range 20% < x < 50% with the strongest response near the EHE

of operation the EHE response of CoPd to low concentration hydrogen can reach
hundreds percent, which makes the method and the material attractive for

co-located with the bright plages in the chromosphere, as they are on the Sun.
Moving to lower masses and slower rotators, we present K2 observations with
simultaneous spectroscopy of EPIC 211928486 (K5V) and EPIC 211966629 (K4V), two

relatively constant as a function of rotational phase. This suggests that

He in a unified theory of collisional line profiles using ab initio
calculations of MgHe potential energies and transition matrix elements among
the singlet electronic states that are involved for the observable spectral
lines. We computed the shapes and line parameters of the Mg lines and studied
their dependence on helium densities and temperatures. We present results over
the full range of temperatures from 4000 to 12000 K needed for input to stellar

temperatures and surface gravities typical for cool DZ white dwarfs. We present
synthetic spectra tracing the behavior of the Mg resonance line profiles under
the low temperatures and high gas pressures prevalent in these atmospheres. The
determination of accurate opacity data of magnesium resonance lines together
with an improved atmosphere model code lead to a good fit of cool DZ white

complexity with mathematical tractability resulted in the proposal and
formulation of a famous minimal model for cell polarisation, known as the wave
pinning model. In this study, we present a three-dimensional generalisation of

semilinear partial differential equations in which protein compartmentalisation
becomes natural. We show how a local perturbation over the surface can trigger
propagating reactions, eventually stopped in a stable profile by the interplay
with the bulk component. We describe the behavior of the model through
asymptotic and local perturbation analysis, in which the role of the geometry
is investigated. The bulk-surface finite element method is used to generate
numerical simulations over simple and complex geometries, which confirm our
analysis, showing pattern formation due to propagation and pinning dynamics.
The generality of our mathematical and computational framework allows to study

neurons, and investigate coupling-induced cluster burst synchronization by
varying the average coupling strength $J_0$. For sufficiently small $J_0$,
non-cluster desynchronized states exist. However, when passing a critical point
$J^*_c~(\simeq 0.16)$, the whole population is segregated into 3 clusters via a
constructive role of synaptic inhibition to stimulate dynamical clustering
between individual burstings, and thus 3-cluster desynchronized states appear.
As $J_0$ is further increased and passes a lower threshold $J^*_l~(\simeq
0.78)$, a transition to 3-cluster burst synchronization occurs due to another
constructive role of synaptic inhibition to favor population synchronization.
In this case, HR neurons in each cluster exhibit burst synchronization.
However, as $J_0$ passes an intermediate threshold $J^*_m~(\simeq 5.2)$, HR
neurons begin to make intermittent hoppings between the 3 clusters. Due to the
intermittent intercluster hoppings, the 3 clusters are integrated into a single
one. In spite of break-up of the 3 clusters, (non-cluster) burst
synchronization persists in the whole population, which is well visualized in
the raster plot of burst onset times where bursting stripes (composed of burst
onset times and indicating burst synchronization) appear successively. With
further increase in $J_0$, intercluster hoppings are intensified, and bursting
stripes also become smeared more and more due to a destructive role of synaptic
inhibition to spoil the burst synchronization. Eventually, when passing a
higher threshold $J^*_h~(\simeq 17.8)$ a transition to desynchronization occurs
via complete overlap between the bursting stripes. Finally, we also investigate
the effects of stochastic noise on both 3-cluster burst synchronization and
intercluster hoppings.

the nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling) framework of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Assuming a simple form of the entropy function,
we find stability for the entire range of physically meaningful model
parameters. For relativistic fluid dynamics, full thermodynamic admissibility
indeed leads to stability.

which have good statistical properties as well as unpredictability in
cryptography. An m-sequence is a linear feedback shift register sequence with
maximal period over a finite field. M-sequences have good statistical
properties, however we must nonlinearize m-sequences for cryptographic
purposes. A geometric sequence is a sequence given by applying a nonlinear
feedforward function to an m-sequence. Nogami, Tada and Uehara proposed a
geometric sequence whose nonlinear feedforward function is given by the
Legendre symbol, and showed the period, periodic autocorrelation and linear
complexity of the sequence. Furthermore, Nogami et al. proposed a
generalization of the sequence, and showed the period and periodic
autocorrelation. In this paper, we first investigate linear complexity of the
geometric sequences. In the case that the Chan--Games formula which describes
linear complexity of geometric sequences does not hold, we show the new formula
by considering the sequence of complement numbers, Hasse derivative and
cyclotomic classes. Under some conditions, we can ensure that the geometric
sequences have a large linear complexity from the results on linear complexity
of Sidel'nikov sequences. The geometric sequences have a long period and large
linear complexity under some conditions, however they do not have the balance
property. In order to construct sequences that have the balance property, we
propose interleaved sequences of the geometric sequence and its complement.
Furthermore, we show the periodic autocorrelation and linear complexity of the
proposed sequences. The proposed sequences have the balance property, and have
a large linear complexity if the geometric sequences have a large one.

functions are powerful tools for unveiling the detailed dynamics and particle
production mechanisms involved in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Measurements of transverse momentum correlators $P_2$ and $G_2$, in particular,
provide added information not readily accessible with better known number
correlation functions $R_2$. However, it is found that the $R_2$ and $G_2$
correlators are somewhat sensitive to the details of the experimental procedure

collision centrality bin width, which may have a rather detrimental impact on
their physical interpretation. A technique to correct these correlators for
collision centrality bin-width averaging is presented. The technique is based
on the hypothesis that the shape of single- and pair- probability densities
vary slower with collision centrality than the corresponding integrated yields.
The technique is tested with Pb-Pb simulations based on the HIJING and
ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics models and shown to enable a
precision better than 1% for particles in the kinematic range $0.2 \leq p_{\rm

The pipeline optimally uses X-ray information by combining many overlapping
observations of a source when possible, both for its detection and its
characterisation. It can robustly detect and characterise several types of
X-ray sources: AGNs (point-like), galaxy clusters (extended), galaxy clusters
contaminated by a central AGN, and pairs of AGNs close on the sky. We perform a
thorough suite of validation tests via realistic simulations of XMM-Newton
images and we introduce new selection criteria for various types of sources
that will be detected by the survey. We find that the use of overlapping
observations allows new clusters to be securely identified that would be missed
or less securely identified by using only one observation at the time. We also
find that with the new pipeline we can robustly identify clusters with a
central AGN that would otherwise have been missed, and we can flag pairs of
AGNs close on the sky that might have been mistaken for a cluster.

(1.0% versus 99.0%) if in addition k=0 (i.e., flat LCDM). We point out,
however, that the value of k is a measure of the net energy (kinetic plus
gravitational) in the Universe and is not constrained theoretically, though
some models of inflation would drive k to 0 due to an expansion-enforced
dilution. Since we here consider only the basic LCDM model, the value of k
needs to be measured and, therefore, the pre-assumption of flatness introduces
a significant bias into the BIC.

previous approaches which were often limited to non-temporal or Markovian
classifiers on a comprehensive benchmark data set (292 participants, 541214

speech related tasks, researchers have started investigating generalizations of
the well-known technique for graph-structured data. A recently-proposed method
called Graph Convolutional Networks has been able to achieve state-of-the-art
results in the task of node classification. However, since the proposed method
relies on localized first-order approximations of spectral graph convolutions,
it is unable to capture higher-order interactions between nodes in the graph.
In this work, we propose a motif-based graph attention model, called Motif
Convolutional Networks (MCNs), which generalizes past approaches by using
weighted multi-hop motif adjacency matrices to capture higher-order
neighborhoods. A novel attention mechanism is used to allow each individual
node to select the most relevant neighborhood to apply its filter. Experiments
show that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on
the semi-supervised node classification task.

compressive sensing systems, which causes information loss and results in bias.
For sparse signal recovery from saturation, we propose to use a linear loss to
improve the effectiveness from existing methods that utilize hard
constraints/hinge loss for sign consistency. Due to the use of linear loss, an
analytical solution in the update progress is obtained, and some nonconvex
penalties are applicable, e.g., the minimax concave penalty, the $\ell_0$ norm,
and the sorted $\ell_1$ norm. Theoretical analysis reveals that the estimation
error can still be bounded. Generally, with linear loss and nonconvex
penalties, the recovery performance is significantly improved, and the
computational time is largely saved, which is verified by the numerical
experiments.

routine blood test results with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to
incorporate them into coronary prediction models and to compare the
discrimination properties of this approach with other prediction functions.
Methods and Results --This work was designed as a retrospective, single-center
study of a hospital-based cohort. The 5060 CHD patients (2365 men and 2695
women) were 1 to 97 years old at baseline with 8 years (2009-2017) of medical
records, 5051 health check-ups and 5075 cases of other diseases. We developed a
two-layer Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT) model based on routine blood
data to predict the risk of coronary heart disease, which could identify 86% of
people with coronary heart disease. We built a dataset with 15,000 routine
blood tests results. Using this dataset, we trained the two-layer GBDT model to
classify healthy status, coronary heart disease and other diseases. As a result
of the classification after machine learning, we found that the sensitivity of
detecting the health data was approximately 93% for all data, and the
sensitivity of detecting CHD was 93% for disease data that included coronary
heart disease. On this basis, we further visualized the correlation between
routine blood results and related data items, and there was an obvious pattern
in health and coronary heart disease in all data presentations, which can be
used for clinical reference. Finally, we briefly analyzed the results above
from the perspective of pathophysiology. Conclusions --Routine blood data
provides more information about CHD than what we already know through the
correlation between test results and related data items. A simple coronary
disease prediction model was developed using a GBDT algorithm, which will allow
physicians to predict CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.

  number",,,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transitions between low-lying electron states in atoms of heavy elements lead
to electromagnetic radiation with discrete energies between about 0.1~keV and
100~keV (x rays) that are characteristic of the element. Moseley's law --- an
empirical relation first described by Moseley in 1913 which supported
predictions of the then-new Bohr model of atomic energy levels while
simultaneously identifying the integer atomic number $Z$ as the measure of
nuclear charge --- predicts that the energy of these characteristic x rays
scales as $Z^2$. The foundational nature of Moseley's experiment has led to the
popularity of Moseley's law measurements in undergraduate advanced laboratory
physics courses. We report here observations of deviations from Moseley's law
in the characteristic $K_{\alpha}$ x-ray emission of 13 elements ranging from
$Z=29$ to $Z=92$. %: Cu, Rb, Mo, Ag, In, Ba, Tb, Ta, W, Pb, Au, Pt, and U.
While following the square-law predictions of the Bohr model fairly well at low
$Z$, the deviations become larger with increasing $Z$ (negligible probability
of the Bohr model fitting data by a $\chi^2$ test). We find that relativistic
models of atomic structure are necessary to fit the full range of atomic
numbers observed (probability value of $0.20$ for the relativistic
Bohr-Sommerfeld model). As has been argued by previous authors, measurements of
the relativistic deviations from Moseley's law are both pedagogically valuable
at the advanced laboratory level and accessible with modern but modest
apparatus. Here, we show that this pedagogical value can be be extended even
further --- to higher $Z$ elements, where the effects are more dramatically
observable --- using apparatus which is enhanced relative to more modest
versions, but nevertheless still accessible for many teaching laboratories.

  from Flow Interaction","15 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.NI cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a method to detect anomalies in a time series of flow interaction
patterns. There are many existing methods for anomaly detection in network
traffic, such as number of packets. However, there is non established method
detecting anomalies in a time series of flow interaction patterns that can be
represented as complex network. Firstly, based on proposed multivariate flow
similarity method on temporal locality, a complex network model (MFS-TL) is
constructed to describe the interactive behaviors of traffic flows. Having
analyzed the relationships between MFS-TL characteristics, temporal locality
window and multivariate flow similarity critical threshold, an approach for
parameter determination is established. Having observed the evolution of MFS-TL
characteristics, three non-deterministic correlations are defined for network
states (i.e. normal or abnormal). Furthermore, intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS)
is introduced to quantify three non-deterministic correlations, and then a
anomaly detection method is put forward for single characteristic sequence. To
build an objective IFS, we design a Gaussian distribution-based membership
function with a variable hesitation degree. To determine the mapping of IFS's
clustering intervals to network states, a distinction index is developed. Then,
an IFS ensemble method (IFSE-AD) is proposed to eliminate the impacts of the
inconsistent about MFS-TL characteristic to network state and improve detection
performance. Finally, we carried out extensive experiments on several network
traffic datasets for anomaly detection, and the results demonstrate the
superiority of IFSE-AD to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our method.
